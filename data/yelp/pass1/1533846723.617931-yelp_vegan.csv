"26 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33130",4/29/2018,$$$,4,Sushiato,"I had miso soup, seaweed salad and the vegan roll to go. They had my order ready when I picked up but I gave this one 4 stars based on value. My bill was $25 for these items and I felt that was a bit high. The restaurant is very nicely done inside, I will try it again."
"12590 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",1/19/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"Pincho Factory, no matter the location, always delivers! Each and every food item is a must-have. They are most popularly known for their Toston burger, but I love the Toston chicken sandwich with queso frito added the most. You can't go wrong with anything though. They are also vegan and vegetarian friendly with their veggie burgers or the rice bowls they have in a myriad of flavors (packed with plenty of veggies). I love the chimichurri bowl with chicken! Packed with bold flavor and the chicken is cooked just right. ,This location is one of the most recent that opened and they are consistent in terms of food quality and service. I love it here and highly recommend coming by for a burger or one of their rice bowls. ,You can also choose to buy sides separately. The tater tots are a huge hit (with good reason) and I suggest trying it with their cilantro aioli sauce vs the Apple butter it comes with. You won't regret it!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/15/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,So glad I found this please thanks to a good friend who recommended it. I had the chicken wrap and it was delicious!! Love that there are gluten-free and vegan options for my husband. He had the black bean wrap with hummus and loved it. The owner and staff are very friendly. Hard to find a great place these days with great customer service. Can't wait to go back and try more things.
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/31/2014,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"HIDDEN GEM! Just had lunch from this precious little spot and absolutely stuffed my face. You know how raw vegan usually leaves you wishing you were a tad fuller? Well my raw zucchini spaghetti hit the spot. It was like a deconstructed sun dried tomato hummus sans the tahini laid over a generous nest of dressed zucchini noodles. Very lemony and savory with the parsley and chickpeas. I'm satisfied!  the juice menu looks delicious too, you know I'll definitely be back for an açai bowl!!!,YES, total yes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/15/2016,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Cute little place that sells smoothies, salads, wraps & acai bowls.  Great for vegetarians & vegans.  My daughter order a monkey bowl & added stawberries to it.  They charge $0.75 for a to-go container.  I think the bowl was around $12.  It was a little pricey for the size but she enjoyed it.  A lot of the customers were regulars and knew to call ahead.  They still had to wait but no one complained.  Will come back to enjoy other items on the menu."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/21/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"FINALLLYYYYY a juice /acai / vegan options place in Pinecrest. Place is TINY; they def need to expand; and it's like 3 people working there so it gets crowded fast, but the menu is on-point, fresh, wholesome, and varied enough to satisfy plant/meat eaters alike. They'll customize anything. My only complaint is that they need to get a bigger space!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/25/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I was in the mood for something healthy in the midst of all this Black Friday craziness and what I found was an amazing tiny whole in the wall. This little treasure is heaven on earth for all you vegan/vegetarian/organic lovers. Now I see people complaining about the price, but you have to understand everything is organic, wild caught, non gmo, and REAL. The price should verify the authenticity for you, there's no way you're going to find a cheap all organic green place. It simply does not exist. But this place is worth the price, the wraps and juices are a good size and are all extremely filling. ,I had the soup of the day and a lentil wrap with hummus and it was soooo good! Filled with veggies and my tummy and body were so pleased. I also had the I Am Raw juice which is a green based juice that was also delicious. ,I can't wait to try their Acai bowls!! ,And the service was great. Very warm and welcoming and filled with good vibes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/22/2017,$$,4,Raw South Juice,Love this place! The only issue I've encountered is the inconsistency of the food sometimes my vegan sandwich  is amazing and then the next day it isn't the same ... it's still good but not as good
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",12/7/2016,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"I started going here because of some health concerns.  Now,  every morning I get a delicious green smoothie here and for lunch I get a large organic salad with chicken. They also have great healthy snacks like their acai bowls and they are raw vegan cookies and chips. I'm not a health freak and I usually do not eat organic or vegan but this place is really good. Everything I've had there including the green smoothie is delicious.  I usually order online at their website and then just go in and pick it up."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Raw has filled a void in Miami for high quality delicious plant based food! I love that they're veggies are organic so I can finally have a salad outside of my house and not have to worry about  nasty fumigation chemicals or GMO's. My favorite thing to get here is their daily special. Even if you are not vegetarian you will like it. They are bowl style and no matter what they are, they are delicious! My favorite is their vegan ""turkey"" picadillo and the black rice! The salad portion in the bowl is always tasty and unique.,The lady at the counter is such a sweetheart, immediately makes you feel welcomed and answers any questions you may have. She has the best energy and I love to see her when I come here.,Raw South is the perfect place to go when looking for healthy delicious food!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/30/2017,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Best vegan and raw little spot ever! The owner is so nice and always there which is a great thing because she oversees it all which in my opinion is the best thing to me it means she cares customers are always satisfied.,Everything is FRESH! ,The blueberry acai bowl is sooooo amazing and she makes it look  beautiful I don't even want to eat it lol ,I've also tried the smoothie almonds forever and it AWESOME!!! ,Today I had the veggie soup, I must say it was very good! ,Everything is a must try! ,Updated 11/30 ,Still love the delicious food but a little disappointed with the amount of veggies I got in my salad that was $11. I got a decent scoop of tuna but not enough of the other veggies. I got a pinch of carrot (granted there is carrots in the tuna salad maybe another vegetable can be added) and maybe 6 tomatoes cut in half with 7 cucumbers. I still think it's Delicious but a little more veggies would be awesome. ,I paid $25 for a smoothie (mango pineapple with no banana) which was pretty good, tuna salad, and 2 chocolate chip cookies."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/17/2018,$$,3,Raw South Juice,"The staff members are hard-working, knowledgeable, and pleasant. It's helpful to have a vegan-friendly place in this area. However, I found the menu difficult to navigate because it does not clearly indicate which items contain animal parts/secretions. Benign-sounding ingredients in the monkey açaí bowl, for instance, are not vegan. Note that their peanut butter chips contain milk and their granola contains honey. When in doubt, ask! The açaí mixture was satisfying--and very cold, so I added coffee (which they don't have) from the bakery next door. That bakery also had some vegan desserts, like dates with cacao. A lovely match, which you can enjoy on one of the communal tables outside. This outdoor atmosphere is convenient, yet hectic. Be prepared to enjoy your organics amid exhaust fumes and honking from the intersection where the Palmetto Expressway, SW 77th Ave, and US1 converge."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/23/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"Ugh! Juice bars and vegan restaurants are so misunderstood.,OK. Here is an explanation for prices. Everything is organic/non GMO. Some stuff is gluten free, and sugar is not used. Also, no animal products are used, unless you are getting a chicken/fish item. That includes ingredients like coconut/rice/hemp/soy/almond milk, vegan cheese, tofu, all that vegan/vegetarian stuff. And it also means raw/unfiltered honey, stevia root and other natural sweeteners. Don't take my word for it though. ASK!,But most important, it also means that the employees are getting paid a decent wage. ,I could keep going, but I will start going into more abstract subjects related to holistic healing and stuff like that. Anyway, the smoothies not only taste good, they make you happy. That is the power of organic foods, they deliver a different experience than normal produce.,Don't believe me? ,I guess you must try it then..."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",2/28/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I'm finally getting around to writing a review! This place is in my general neighborhood, so I come here often enough. Yes, it is a bit pricey; that is to be expected at an all natural, non-GMO, non-preservative, fresh produce and juices based restaurant. But the food is well worth it. It's a great place for health conscious people and vegans, vegetarians, and anyone in between looking for a place to eat lunch. My only complaint is that I wish they stayed open later. ,I like to bike here sometimes and munch on their veggie wraps, or slurp on their almonds are forever smoothie. They have a good selection of salads, as well. Their monkey bowl is pretty good too; it's a pretty big bowl so it's more fun to share with someone else. They also have the strawberry bowl, blueberry acai bowl (with almond butter is yummy), tropical acai, and other options. Their food is filling, and is definitely a favorite. ,They have bike parking, and car parking is in the lot. No wifi, but it's a great place to just sit and enjoy a book. It's usually pretty peaceful, so big groups aren't recommended. If you do want to be noisy, there is outdoor seating. ,Overall great experience, friendly staff, and aside from the above average prices and early closing hours, it's a great place to have lunch, brunch, an afternoon snack, early dinner after work-anything that fits your routine."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,5,Raw South Juice,Really delicious and fresh food as well as smoothies. Order took about 15 minutes. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for fresh vegan food. A little pricey but considering the freshness and and flavors it's well worth it
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",2/16/2017,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"As a newly found vegan I have been struggling finding restaurants that will satisfy my taste buds and dietary restrictions. What's awesome about Greenlife is that their food is delicious, healthy, and fast!  On top of that their staff is phenomenal. Every time I walk in I'm greeted with beaming smiles from everyone. ,Okay back to the food... I've eaten the black bean burger wrap each time I've been here. What can I say, I'm a creature of habit and once I find something I like it's hard for me to break free from it. It's savory, has a little kick of spiciness, and is filling! I know there are plenty more options I can choose from but for now I'm satisfied with this option :),I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for a healthy lunch spot. I'm sure I'll be back again soon!"
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/21/2018,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"Love this little place!!! Would come here on my lunch breaks or whenever. They allow you to build your own bowl, which I think is so cool make ordering so easy the carrot cake is the bomb taste so good is vegan also delicious"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/19/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Service amazing, pizza vegan amazing w homemade vegan sausage ! What ? Yea !!so yummy! local beer and international la Estrella beer amazing , vegan ice cream option just perfect ! they even let my puppy sit w us outside . 100 points for them."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/21/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"I never really cared for pizza until I found Paulie Gee's octopus pizza. It is seriously INSANE. I know it sounds weird but only until you try it, absolutely deliciiious. And btw, their vegan pizza are also really good, try the vegan ricotta and vegan sausage!!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/17/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,5/5! I absolutely love the fact that Paulie Gees has a whole vegan menu and not only accommodates meat eaters. I tried the Vegan Greenpointer and it was okay but In Ricotta Da Vegan was amazing!! The faux fennel sausage was hearty and the arugula and cashew Ricotta went extremely well with the combo. Definitely recommend this place and will be back. Service was great and the pizza was out within 5 minutes of ordering it!
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The do a good pizza here at Paulie Gee's.  It's not Steve's or Dominos, so if you are in the market for those this isn't your place, but if you want high quality ingredients done in interesting combos you don't see everywhere this is your place.  Add to that a very warm, unique environment and a friendly staff from the owner on down, and Paulie Gee's is a can't miss in Mimo.  You have to check out the octopus pizza, the BBQ Brisket pie and the vegan tomato sauce.  Check it out!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/12/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"So far so good, due to my ball and chain I've only had the Vegan pies but they've been fantastic every time. I'll eventually try the regular pies but I have to say the dough at this place is some of the best I've had. I def recommend giving this place a try"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,The vegan pizza was really good. I asked for a little bit of arugula the whole d@*m pie was full with arugula. When I picked off the greenery I had enough for a salad. The vegan cheese was great and the sausage was fantastic. Next time I need to try the dessert
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/7/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing Pizza, Service and alAtmosphere. The Chef talked to us since it wasn't that busy and he was so polite just wanted to know how we liked everything. We had the Vegan Pizza that came with HOUSE MADE  vegan sausage and ricotta cheese once again AMAZING! Will be coming back FOR SURE!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/28/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Love love love this place! It just opened and we have already returned three times. My boyfriend has recently turned vegan due to health restrictions but it's been a blessing in disguise. We have discovered holes in the wall places and experimented with off the beaten path dishes. We LOVE this place in particular for their vegan pies. The crust with the perfect char is what dreams are made of and the cashew ricotta dollops give me life! Inventive combinations of ingredients were meticulously arranged so substitutions are discouraged, I get that having lived six years in Italy the Italians too are very methodical in regards to the flavor arrangement leaving little to no room for changes. Don't take it personally, it's a science! Just walked out the door and already planning my return trip. ,I don't get way people are bashing this place on Yelp and my mind is blown by the comparison to Steve's Pizza and Spris... I have no bad reviews to pass onto either of those places but they aren't even in the same pizza league as Paulie Gee's. ,Try it! Forget all you know about junk-fast food pizzas... this place is purely for the artisanal pizza lovers!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/14/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing pizza with a great aesthetic. Seriously good pizzas and craft beer in an old Chinese restaurant that has been gutted but preserved. Lots of really cool Street art adorns the walls. They offer great vegan options as well, off street parking and good vibes."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/19/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The moon and stars were aligned tonight my friends. The mood, vintage china palace sign, and my appetite could only agree. The twinkle in her eyes gave me confidence we were in the right establishment. It was truly a magicaL experience. From vegan fennel sausage with cashew ricotta dipping sauce to a nicely portioned red, white, and greenpeaCe piZZa, Paulie Gee's came through in the clutch to say the least. My man Jason even gave us a run down of their trademarked triple proofed process of dough making. Can you say 95% gluten free crust? That's a true dough master if you ask me. Jason I will lend you my magical red boujee robe for some magical boujee vegan sausage. ,A simple candle light ambience was all that was needed to put the official stamp on a one of a kind dining experience. Hash tag magic happens here..."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/8/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"This is probably some of the best pizza in Miami, and hands down THE BEST vegan pizza in Miami. So happy to have found Paulie Gee's! Not to mention the awesome staff."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/3/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie Gee's is one of my top 3 favorite places for pizza. Me and my wife drive all the way from Ft. Lauderdale just to have their pizza. They make excellent Neapolitan style pizza with a vegan twist (they serve both vegan and non-vegan pies). Their house made vegan sausage and cashew ricotta cheese is amazing! Also, the place itself has a really cool vibe and great for a couple's night out. My only ""complaint"" is that they do not accept American Express."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2018,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've driven by this place a bunch of times, but stopped in for the first time tonight. My partner can't eat dairy, and we were told that they have a good vegan pizza, so we thought we'd finally give it a try. Her pizza was delicious! I got the spinach pizza with garlic and it was awesome! The crust was perfectly crispy and chewy, fresh from the wood burning oven. The veggies were super fresh. The ricotta I added was creamy and tangy and a wonderful addition. Service was SUPERB - which is so refreshing to experience in Miami. We'll definitely be back!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/24/2018,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've ordered a couple times from Paulie Gee's. Mostly because it's a close and quick delivery when we're hungry. We've tried a vegan (In ricotta da  vegan) and a regular pizza (Green Pointer) and both were ok. Not your regular cheese slice and they have a creative twist on ingredients.  I like the chewy crust but need to try other options , next time one with more sauce.  The two I've gotten have had a lot of arugula. Too much that you can't really taste any of the other ingredients or flavors. Find it a bit pricey for these gourmet pizzas. It's not the New York Pizza I was expecting but I get what they're doing.    Also, ordered the eggplant parm which contributes to the 3 stars. Super disappointed. There must of been only 2 or 3 slices of eggplant and such a small portion for $22. I shouldn't of assumed that $22 meant an entree , the portion was more like an appetizer. I should of know better than to order eggplant parm from a pizza place.  Ironside pizza is close by and I personally think a better option."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/16/2014,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,The staff is really friendly and they have the best view in Doral . The selection is very healthy. The pizzas are well done and the salads are delicious . They serve almost everything in to go plastic bowls and cup. I love this place I just wish they were more Eco friendly and have more vegetarian/vegan options ( vegan cheese would be great)
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",12/21/2015,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Healthy and tasty food. Multiple choices for the vegan/healthy conscious oriented eater. ,Friendly service, nice location with a pretty view and they cater and deliver! ,Delivery is fast and accurate. ,Regular customer; will indeed go every day!   ,Will love for them to have a frequent  customer program... ,Great place! Love it!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/8/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Great spot! Healthy. Fresh food. Good view of the water. Would love to see more vegan options, but otherwise A+! :)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/10/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Delicious, great service and chill vibe. We had the avocado tuna salad and vegan colorful salad. Both very yummy. My kids had the pumpkin soup and adashah bowl, which they enjoyed. This was our first visit, but we will be back to try out more if the menu."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie gees delivers excellent, creative, flavorful pizzas in a scenic, art filled establishment. The staff is friendly and the variety is out of this world. I appreciate their vegan pizzas and desert options. I saw the dominoes across the street and couldn't help but laugh at how much more authentic this pizza is. How'd they manage to fit so much creativity into one business?! Do yourself a favor and try this!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",3/2/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,So healthy and so delicious I cant stop eating. Vegan options and all natural and very fresh. Staff is very sweet and welcoming. Love this place.
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/16/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Vegan Nutella pizza... NUFF said. ,This place keeps it real, NY style pizzas right on Biscayne blvd baby. Love the passion and character that PG's gives off, from the funky art all over to the beautiful leopard charred pizza crust. ,The owner also has a strong background in NY style pizza and when you mix that skill with catering to vegans; well... what you get is pure art. Homemade cashew ricotta, homemade vegan fennel sausage, Vegan Nutella pizza? Come on who even thinks of these things? Nucking futs.,Oh, and it's BOGO pizza every Wednesday + karaoke. ,Yes, You're welcome."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/24/2017,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Tried one of the vegan pizzas. ,Pros: ricotta is delicious, dough is excellent and perfectly cooked. Sauce is fresh and yummy. ,Cons: entirely too much arugula. Enough to make a side salad. ,I paid $3.00 to add mushrooms to my pizza and got a couple of stems. Total rip off. ,Also ""sausage"" was very sparse. Pretty yummy so I wish there was more."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Awesome service. Such a cool and funky spot, bring friends who are into that. Vegan here-- awesome vegan pizza and the cheese is actually good and unique! Vegan nutella pizza!!! Have yet to see that elsewhere, give it a try. Non-vegan approved too!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/22/2016,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Hey! What do you know? Vegan pizza?,A friend of mine told me about Paulie Gee. I searched in my database and I remembered the NY pizza guy that is pretty famous in NY, actually had won some of the best pizza awards over there. ""Yes, that's the guy"", my friend told me. And with that introduction, I move on to my review.,The space is brand new, and it sits few people (as of the date on the review). One community table for about a dozen, and three tables for about another dozen. If you don't mind eating at the bar, I am sure you don't, then add another dozen more. At the bar, they serve local beers from MIA, Wakefield, Funky, etc, so that is a big plus for the pizza/beer combo.,The pizza is pretty good, but it is hard to rate. The toppings and the combinations are really good, and the dough is burnt and chewy. The pizza sauce is delicious, the cheeses are really good quality, but the dough may feel pedestrian and average. It has a very subtle flavor that is really hard to catch. I would compare it to naan bread, but it tastes like pizza. The good thing about it is that you can fold it easily (it actually folds itself!), and you can chew on that stuff forever, on and on and on.,The salads are excellent, and they have many vegetarian choices. Also, they have a whole list of vegan pizza which I found very enticing.,The people here are very friendly, very humble. The kitchen is just an open oven, with locals working around diligently. I really liked the atmosphere.,Big plus: One retro pinball machine in the back. Drop a dollar."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/22/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've eaten here a couple of times and overall the food is hit or miss, and the service is a little on the slow side. Parking definitely sucks but it is one of the only places offering so many healthy choices especially for people who are vegan/vegetarian/gluten free. The avocado toast is good but there have been times I've gotten a soggy piece of bread with the smallest crumbles of goat cheese on top. Definitely give it a try, especially if you are trying to eat healthy or looking for vegan options! It's a little on the pricey side but everything in Miami is."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",7/20/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"On a vegan kick lately and this casual high quality food concept is great. I love this trend of healthy food done right places to eat.,I had a pumpkin soup and a super foods salad. Really clean and fresh flavors with combinations I've never had before.,Price is fair considering ingredient quality."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2017,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I'm sure that vegans/gluten free people around the world as over joyed over this place! It is very creative and has a variety of items on the menu. However, if you are not vegan, gluten free, low calorie and are on vacation wanting to eat ALL of your calories- choose another pace. Lol. This was great- but this week I am not counting calories so I was an it underwhelmed that was my fault none of the restaurants. Most of the waiters speak Spanish but our waiter was nice explained the menu and we got a picture of mimosa. Oh and the outside view is great(part of the reason why I stayed even though the menu was looking a hit healthier than I anticipated)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/22/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,AWESOME for a gluten free and vegan diet in an area where my options are all fried nonsense and heavy dairy. LOVED this place. Kind service too!
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/6/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,Small place on the lake in Doral.  Very fresh food with good service and decent prices.  They have many Vegan options  which I've tried and enjoyed very much.  I highly recommend for lunch in Doral.  Check in via Yelp for a free glass of wine.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/6/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"The place is a little crowded due to its small size, but just go outside and enjoy the beautiful deck they have in the back looking to a lake. The food is nice, I ordered a tuna salad, then we ordered smoothies, but I think that the salads neither any plate they offer is to eat in the restaurant. Everything is served in plastic containers. All the drinks came in plastic containers also, not to environmentally friendly in a restaurant where vegan people and green people come to eat. Other wise the experience was nice, a little bit slow the service to get your initial order but after that everything is fast."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,"We decided to visit Delirio Fresh on a Saturday late afternoon for a juice and a wrap. Their menu had many vegan and gluten free options to choose from and we were excited to discover a juice place that had so many food options. ,We ordered a Green Love Juice from the Green Juices section of the menu which has kale, spinach, cucumber, mint, ginger, and lime. We also ordered a Vegan Love Wrap and an herbal tea. While they were out of herbal tea I was pleasantly pleased that the waitress was able to provide me a small sample that was delicious! ,The wrap was good with a hearty amount of roasted vegetables and the portion size was generous. They offer gluten free wraps however, on this visit we chose the spinach wrap. ,The Green Love ""Juice"" was NOT a juice at all. Instead, what I received was a smoothie . Upon reviewing the menu again, the picture does look more like a smoothie than a juice. Furthermore, I missed the note that they're sweetened with Stevia .  Needless to say, it wasn't what I expected and I would not return with the expectation of having a juice here. ,The service was good, the menu variety is great, the ability to dine on their patio with a view of the water is nice. We'll likely be returning to try other menu items. Overall, I'd recommend giving this venue with plenty of vegan gluten free options a chance at least once. ,Happy Eats!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/30/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Had to go to Doral for school, and had to check out Delirio Fresh while I was there! I was completely surprised by the gorgeous outdoor water view. I first heard of the restaurant from Instagram, and I'm a huge healthy food fan, so I was excited to come and try this restaurant. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order, because all of the menu items looked delicious here. This doesn't normally happen to me as a vegetarian who likes flavorful and healthy food! I eventually settled on the Low Carb Vegan Bowl, which contained adashah (locally produced vegan based lentil protein), roasted veggies, mashed roasted pumpkin, avocado, chopped cilantro, sesame seeds and Delirio vegan dressing. I loved it, and found it reasonably priced. Also discovered when I was here that they have a location in downtown Miami, which is very close to me! It's called Delirio Fresh express (not exactly sure what makes it express), and I can't wait to try it! If you like plenty of creative healthy options at a reasonable price, and/or a nice setting to meet with friends, Delirio Fresh is your place!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/20/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Definitely a phenomenal option for people that like healthy and/or vegan food. This is a 5 star food and rockstar place with such a great lake view!!!! The only star that I can add there is the parking....... is few more business attached to their place so please be sure you wait in line for parking or park right in the front of the restaurant. If the bars beside or shops see you walking to the restaurant they are not friendly because is a very limited parking options. So sad because food and the place is AMAZING!!!'
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/28/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Great place for healthy alternatives. I'm vegan and had a few choices to pick from which is usually not the case. I went for the veggie sandwich without the cheese on gluten free bread and it was scrumptious! The water view in the back makes the place even more inviting! Will definitely be my go to place in Doral!
"601 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/6/2018,$$,5,La Centrale,"One of my overall favorite dining experiences ever occurred at Stagionale, the vegetarian/vegan restaurant in La Centrale. The entire experience was premium and holistic. The staff was friendly and we were checked up upon the perfect amount of time- not too much nor too little. The manager and owner thanked us for the patronage and made sure we enjoyed our experience and the server was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. ,The food was amazing starting with a kimchi shot for digestion. We decided to do 1 miami spice menu but chose both the jackfruit tacos and a side of edamame sliders. The entree for the miami spice was the gnocchi which was also good. The waiter suggested the carbonara with bacon tempeh (not on the menu) and it was one of the best vegan dishes I've had in my life. The dessert was also good as well. It ended with pills of turmeric and wheat grass and the experience has me craving more... we'll be back! ,P.S. 18% gratuity was added at the end but the service was definitely worth it,P.P.S. The menu was recently changed a few days before our visit and it is great!"
"59 W 3rd St, Hialeah, FL 33010",12/13/2015,$$,5,La Fresa Francesa,"My first time in Hialeah and I loved it! My favorite part of visiting the city was eating here. The staff was attentive,courteous and more than helpful. The owners were more  accommodating for me being that I'm vegan and created a masterpiece that tasted just as good as it looked.,The owners are so hospitable and really care about your experience at their restaurant and go above and beyond to help even create something that works with your diet. They also recommended an antique store and it was a double win for me. It had such a vast collection of all types of antiques and they were actually very well priced and realistically . The lady who owns it was more than friendly as well.,All in couldn't have made a better choice but to eat here. The decor inside is so well embellished with accenting pieces that all work beautifully  together to create a place that almost feels like you aren't in Florida, anymore .  Everything was thought out from when you first walk in to even the ornate tableware  itself .,I really Loved my whole Hialeah experience !"
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/7/2015,$$,4,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"The place is small, and just what I wanted. It was a yelp find, and I couldn't be happier. They have vegan/vegetarian options, which is fantastic. They have wine, beer & tequila for their Margaritas. Right away, I was enamored with this restaurant. You wouldn't think the food would be so good. But it is, it's a Mexican hole-in-the-wall in the middle of Cuban Westchester. Go, try it, you'll love it."
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/20/2015,$$,5,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"Excellent food, and for a vegan very accommodating when I asked for no cheese or sour cream. Only set back which I did not count against them; was the poor girl was running around as the only employee besides the kitchen staff. Very quaint and fairly quiet and intimate for a date night.  It is small so don't be deceived by the first impression."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/31/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A hidden jem in Wynwood, Miami. After being really disappointed in another restaurant (Kiji Cuzco) in Wynwood my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Love Life Cafe. From the moment I entered even after being starving and cranky from the last place I was in complete bliss the aura alone made me happier. The cafe offers a great vegan selection and Miguel (the cook and waitress) was such a cheerful person  to speak to. It was my boyfriends birthday and I really wanted to treat him to a nice meal. Being that we're both vegan it's difficult to find a place that we could eat anything on the menu and this place for filled this, as well as make filling food anyone would enjoy. I ordered the Plant Powered Arepas (they are to die for) and my boyfriend ordered the Best Burger (I have never tasted a better burger). There's Holistic health and Yoga I wish I was here longer to take advantage of! Overall great environment and vibes."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,best vegan spot in wynwood! the burger is honestly better than a lot of regular burgers i've had. new favorite!
"78 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/14/2017,$$,4,The Lunchbox,"Great place with high quality ingredients. Not for everybody though. Their dishes are rich in raw vegetables and natural kind of flavors. With their organic-local concept, it deserve the visit. All the beef is grass fed, the chicken is cage free and the pork is humanely born and raised. Vegetables are from local farms that guarantee the freshness of the dishes. Highly recommended for organic, healthy, vegan and gluten free customers!"
"78 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/6/2016,$$,5,The Lunchbox,"FANTASTIC food! Delicious. Healthy. Vegan friendly! Love this spot.,Ordered potato and leek soup and the Asian salad.. Perfect lunch! Great vibe and great location!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/14/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Loving the love life cafe a hidden gem in the tail end of wynwood customers and employees are just sweet/ kind all around. You have to try the love life burger, delicious from the first bite to the last paired with the sunshine spice smoothie was a meal in vegan heaven. I'm definitely coming back."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/7/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Super super super good plant based drippins. If your vegan and want food that you can taste the love then this is the place for you. Best Vegan Burger around by far. 100% vegan menu so you dont have to worry . Place has such an awsome energy and vibe dont take my word come find out your missing out.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This food was amazing. A great variety of vegan food and I was in heaven haha. My husband had the Veggie Burger and he said it was extremely good. It was gone very quickly. It came with sweet potato fries with cilantro garlic aioli that was VERY good. I ordered the Walnut Lentil Tacos and was extremely impressed. We each ordered smoothies that also tasted fresh and delicious. No complaints at all. ,You order at the checkout line and they bring the order out to your table. Very relaxed and casual environment."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/29/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I love the food here! I usually get delivery since its near my office. The Love Life Salad is great! I also love the Taco Salad. Both are incredible salad option. Curry lentil soup is pretty good, although on some days its better than others. This doesn't bother me though because that means they make it fresh everyday! The zucchini noodles and meatless meatballs are also my favorite. The sweet potatoes fries are really good too. They taste baked, so not too oily. Can't say anything negative, the food is amazing and I feel great eating so many veggies. I'm not actually vegan, I just enjoy vegan food!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/24/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Amazing food. Good vibe. Try the Crema (cashew cream) with whatever you order. It's delicious. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but this place has become a favorite.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great vegan restaurant with a little shop!,Well organized space with a high ceiling.,The waiters are really friendly and ready to give advices and little extra herbs or anything.,Ingredients are fresh and prepared in front of you. There's also a good range of choices for a vegan place!,Good pop music.,Only downside is the location a bit out-centered and near the highway but you don't feel it inside."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/19/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,I really love this place even though it is pricey! The arepas are my absolute favorite and I love the desserts that they offer! My husband (who is not a vegan or vegetarian) said the burger is one of the best burgers he's ever had!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/20/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,AMAZING vegan food. My favorite by far is the award winning vegan burger.. definitely recommend even to my non-vegan friends!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I would of never found this place if not have trying yoga here! But they have the most delicious vegan food, the menu is well thought out, the ingredients are super top notch, its a super homey feel, the salads are amazing, and the burger is literally the best! Its also pretty convenient and quick considering its made to order right in front of you! LOVE everyone and Love Life Wellness they feed your belly and your soul ;)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Tastiest vegan pizza and burger, and the salads are ummmazzinng!!!! Everything is soo good and fresh, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/12/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"One of the BEST vegan places I have ever visited! Delicious bowls, great service and chill, yogi ambience! Definitely recommend it and will come back during my stay in MIA, I love love life!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"As vegan meals go, these people got it right. Fresh made on the spot. Wholesome ingredients and well balanced flavors. Really good. ,  Warning: from the outside you see yoga sign and the symbol that's it, had to double check, but when I went inside the place clearly was a studio for gathering with the kitchen being more an added bonus, but WOW, great bonus."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/30/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Don't walk - RUN - to Love Life Cafe. Tried it out today with a friend who is more vegetarian/vegan for lunch today and was super impressed! The lentil curry soup is TO DIE for and I literally want them to sell it by the gallon so I can eat it every day. I also had the Love Life salad which was HUGE and so filling. I could have just ordered a side salad with the soup or just the big salad and been fine. Service was amazing and it is a whole wellness center. Looking forward to trying more of the great food and trying the other non-cafe services that they offer. Will be back!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A little hard to find but trust me, well worth the find ! The food was amazing and delicious ! Highly recommended this place for a great vegan lunch !"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/7/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,I ordered  my lunch on UberEATS from love life cafe. I had the burrito which came with a small salad and I also purchased a cookie for dessert. Everything was delicious! I could only finish half of the burrito and left the other for left overs for later. I will definitely be going to the cafe to check out the ambiance and try more of their delicious vegan food!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/14/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Happy to be the first review for this hidden spot in wynwood. Although I am not a vegan, I try to focus in low processed - plant based foods. The arepas and the tacos were very good. And the Kale salad was awesome. Friendly staff and cool looking center."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This veggie burger is seriously delicious. It's actually become a problem that I live only a mile away and become a regular. In adventurous moods, I've also tried the incredible pizza (best vegan pizza I've ever had) and pulled jackfruit sandwich, which was similarly delectable. I won't lie that the prices are a little steep, but the ingredients and care with which everything is prepared makes it worth the price. The staff are all friendly and the space is interesting. Ultimately, do yourself a favor and go because you won't be disappointed by the burger (if you're vegan or otherwise)."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/20/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"REALLY like this place, not quite 5 stars, but still really yum. I am happy to finally see the vegan food scene starting to gain some sustainable traction in Miami - it has taken a LONG TIME.,That said, not all vegan food is health food per se. So, you still have to be conscious of what you are eating.,Overall, I think Love Life provides a solid balance of healthy vegan food with indulgent vegan food. The prices are a little high, but not extreme. (Except for the bottled drinks - those markups are pretty extreme),So far we've tried the veggie burger (*really good* Best in America? ), Walnut meat tacos (tasty, very filling, but pretty bland), the arepas (also great, super filling, but missing spice) and The cuban burritto (ditto).,The sides really stand out as the most well seasoned and delicious - the kale salad and the sweet potato fries are winners.,My biggest desire for the food here - is for it to have more flavor. To play more with seasoning, textures and sauces. (Vegan ""aioli"" is as over-played (and unhealthy) as the real thing.),I have not tried any of the desserts yet. But they are on the list!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/17/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"This place quickly caught my eye as more than just a vegan cafe but a wellness center. They offer spiritual talks and yoga classes which I appreciate very much. I think its very commendable for a food place to get involved in the community going above and beyond by showcasing what they preach. ,The place is on the corner of 27th and 6th. Its a huge 2 story place with couches and large tables to host large groups. They also have a large studio for their yoga classes and not sure whats upstairs. ,I came around 9 am on a Monday morning for a few hours and the first thing I tried was their bodytek smoothie which is a green smoothie with  vanilla vega protein. It was good but didnt leave a lasting impression. I would have gotten a cold press juice if I went back. ,For food I ordered El Burrito and their award winning vegan burger. El Burrito was great! Fresh lettuce and beans with a nice cream sauce- got it for a nonvegan and he loved it! ,The burger comes with sweet potatoes and a salad. I must say the burger was THE BEST vegan burger i have ever had! The vegan cheese wasnt too smokey and the burger was exceptional. It was delicious! Highly recommend! Loved it ,The reason I give it a star less is because of the service. The 2 people behind the counter making the food were great, freindly, and very helpful but I couldnt help but notice there were so many people who seemed to  work there. There was about 5 or 6 people going behind the counter grabing cups and puting things away all without acknowledging me. Very very laid back environment. Mind you I was the only customer buying food there and I was there for 2 hours...,In fact while the young lady was making my food a women by the name of Veronica kept interruping her to ask her questions about stock and if she put the kale away etc..All food prep talk that should be taken care of when there is NOT any customers around and esp when the customers food is being prepared, please let her focus on the magic she is making. ,Meanwhile, there was an artist walkkng around placing his artwork and another young guy rearranging the flowers as if they just opened this week. Then I ask and they have been open for a year! I think decorating and food prep should be done behind closed doors or before the place opens. And awknowledge your customers!,I think this place is really on to something with their concept of full body all around wellness and off the wall food. I just think with a little more organization and better customer service it'd be just right."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow, we found our new favorite Vegan Cafe. That didn't take long at all. Either did our wait for perfect clean food. Wow. ,Curry Lentil soup, a super clean veggie soup. Carrots and celery added perfectly. A veggie burger on a pretzel bun with massaged kale, incredible. Moist and so well balanced. The hummus and dressings are perfect and the baked spicy sweet potato fries (not fried) JUST WOW WOW WOW! ,Pictures will be added next time we go!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"By far my favourite vegan cafe in Miami. I'm celiac and now vegan as a result of health issues. I've ordered from here twice in the last two days on Uber eats and have received BEYOND what I asked for. All meals are exactly as ordered with accommodations made, and the staff is SO kind. I cannot wait to stop by in person and pay them a visit. Everything is local, organic, and made in house (a rare find for food that arrives so quickly). This to me, seems more like a movement than just a cafe which I truly have a lot of respect for. Keep it up, and keep loving life"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Best vegan place in the wynwood area! Fun, creative spot where they do yoga/wellness classes. Lots of gluten free options as well. I'm not vegan, but thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Big portions!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My first time coming & it won't be my last. I'm always in search of a great vegan/vegetarian spot, and this one made it to the list. I had the avocado toast with the kale salad on the side. I was speechless, the flavors came together perfectly. I will recommend this spot to my friends : ) ,(A plus: you can take yoga classes in the second floor)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/15/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Good was amazing! Had the vegan burger with gluten free bread - super yum! My husband had the Cuban wrap and he loved. Can't wait to go back!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great spot in Wynwood! They have really tasty Vegan options and you wouldn't even know how healthy this food really is, cause it tastes so good. Don't expect super fast service if they are busy, but its worth any wait time!"
"2960 SW Coral Way, Miami, FL 33145",7/3/2016,$$,5,Jardim de Portugal,"My husband had a craving for bacallao so we came here. They did not disappoint. I'm vegan and they actually had a small vegetarian menu. I ordered the rice with vegetables and it was absolutely delicious. The food was excellent,so was the wine and the service.  Definitely coming back here. No hassle to park. Free parking right next door."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/24/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My latest favorite vegan restaurant. As a foodie I think it's important that even healthy vegan foods should taste great. Not ""good for being vegan or healthy"" and unfortunately sometimes healthy and/or vegan food lacks flavor. This is NOT the case for Love life.,I've been coming here since I tried their best veggie burger at a veggie burger battle last year.,They continue to experiment and improve their menu. ,Located in Wynwood this is a shared space with a yoga studio(studio is located upstairs). It's a casual boho vibe with one large communal table and a few small tables. My current favorite is the chamo bowl which is listed under their specials menu (temporary menu) near the register. It's a latín inspired bowl filled with brown rice, black beans, shredded seasoned jackfruit that looks exactly like pulled meat, plantains, avocado and some delicious sauces drizzled on top. I'm salivating as I write this btw. I hope they never remove this from their menu because it is delicious. In addition they have veggie burgers, salads, bowls, pizzas, soups, acai bowls, smoothies and desserts. There is something for everyone. Keep sharing the  love, love life we see you! ,P.s they teamed up with happy vegan bakers and are now offering some of their pastelitos . Does life get any better than this?"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/7/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This is hands down the best vegan restaurant I've been to in Miami. The service was on point. Everyone was super nice. The food was out of this world. The tacos were the perfect combination of spices. The gluten free Mac and cheese was moist, cheesy and delicious. Kale salad was perfect. Sweet potato fries were fantastic with this amazing sauce that I couldn't get enough of. You will not be disappointed. This is my new vegan spot. Oh AND dog friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This review is based solely off my experience with Love Life Cafe via Uber-eats because I have YET to visit the actual location, but they've easily become my go-to vegan spot when I want to order takeout. I've had a few items from their menu and they were all great: the best veggie burger in america (delicious flavor for a plant based burger), the pizza Diabola (first vegan pizza i tried and i'm hooked) and the Pizza Verde (also very delicious and healthy). I need to stop by in person soon :)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2018,$$,3,Love Life Cafe,"I was really excited about this place and I'm not going to say it's not a good spot, but I will say it is pricey and there might be better options out there.  I had the best vegan burger in America and while I felt the title was optimistic I had other feelings about it.  I've been to several vegan restaurants so I feel I have the right to compare.  I'm very happy to see this type of restaurant in the Wynwood area and I'm happy to see that it's a community type place.  I would love to see freshly brewed ice tea or other drinks here and not just everything in a bottle.  Good menu and certainly a place to start for someone trying to make the switch or trying something new.   Closing it out at a 3.5 rating."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/22/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Following a doctor's appointment at Boscom Eye Clinic (eye surgery), my husband and I desired some good 'ole vegan food. I conducted a Yelp search and found Love Life Café, so we jumped in the car and headed about 3 miles away. As we drove I became a little nervous by the neighborhood, but didn't say anything as my husband couldn't really see after his doctor's visit. Had he been able to see he would have said, ""keep on driving"". I am one that is up for interesting places to eat, so I thought it would be fun to eat in a place located in an industrial park that was probably once a garage to fix cars. ,I was pleased with the décor. It is an open space with couches, chairs and tables. They do all sorts of classes during the week, so would be an interesting place to go outside of the food. That being said, on to the food....,I placed our order at the counter and sat down. I ordered a ""cheeseburger"" and my husband a regular Best in the World or something like that, burger. it was delivered rather quickly and was absolutely delicious. My ""cheeseburger"" was better than my husband's ""best in the universe"" burger. I wasn't overly happy with the fries as they were limp, apparently they needed a good dose of Viagra.,I would have loved to give them a 5 star even with the ED fries; however, the customer service was lacking. When we walked in the young man at the front desk didn't say one word to us. As I mentioned earlier my husband had an eye appointment and was unable to see so I had to read the menu to him. I then had to guide him to the table so I told the cashier to give me a minute and I would come back and order. He looked as though he could have cared less...and didn't say one word. No ""what can I get you"", no ""no worries"". Nothing. It wasn't just the lack of verbal communication it was his presence. He acted as if he could have cared less that we were there...and in fact there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant so I would hope they would want their staff to be extra friendly. ,We had an opportunity to go back the next day since we had a follow-up appointment but decided to give another restaurant a try and experienced better customer service."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Ooooooommmmmmmggggggggg. Came here with my girlfriend because she's vegan and I'm not. OMG amazingggg. I will start eating here regularly. Take outs etc .... you need to come to this place ...
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/10/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow! Hands down the Best veggie burger Ive ever had. I'm always looking for new vegan/vegetarian places and this is definitely in my top favorites. ,Really awesome spot, small menu and the food is just really good - flavorful, and best of all healthy...the veggie burger, wraps and salads are all great. The vegan carrot cake is outstanding.,My least favorite thing are the arepas. They were really bland tasting, texture was just layers of mush. I added hot sauce for more flavor. All in all love the food, staff is super friendly will be back!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/21/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Just passing through Miami and was looking for a vegan restaurant. Thanks to Yelp we found this gem!  Food was fresh and delicious. Staff was very friendly. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable. I had the pizza verde and my daughter had the sunshine spice smoothie both were awesome!  If you are in the Wynwood area, check them out. PS-they are also pet friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Love life cafe is the best began cafe in Miami! The menu items are unique and priced reasonable considering they are organic  & have a gluten free option. Super tasty and always fresh. Don't expect your food to be out in 5-10 minutes if you're in a rush. They take their time to prepare a delicious meal but trust me you won't regret the wait!! The desserts are to die for especially the vegan carrot cake YUMMM!!!
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/21/2017,$$,4,MIAM,"Best breakfast/brunch of my recent trip to Miami. Very cute cafe in the super trendy/hipster Wynwood area. You order at the counter but there is table service. The menu featured several gluten free, dairy free and vegan options. The coconut chia pudding topped with nuts and fruit was even tastier than it was beautiful (and you'll probably agree that it is quite Instagram worthy). My only small complaint was the cold brew was terrible. I'm hard pressed to call a coffee terrible as someone who loves coffee so maybe it was an off day? Regardless next Miami vacation will no doubt include a visit to Miam."
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/15/2018,$$,4,MIAM,"Wynwood overall is pretty trendy so Miam does not fail to give that cool wynwood vibe. It was easy to find parking, there wasn't a long line. My partner tried their breakfast burrito and I tried the vegan version which was the exact same thing only that his had bacon. Breakfast burrito was good but not filling. Vegan donut was good but you need to pair it with a cup a coffee, it makes it taste better. ,Try their chai tea latte iced, loved it because it's not as sweet as others I've tried. Service very friendly!"
"860 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/7/2018,$,3,Eastside Taqueria,"I was very excited for them to open up as it's right out front of my house so takes me one second to walk there! I like that they have options outside of only meat however, I wish they had a vegetarian option not only vegan. I'm fully supportive of vegans however, I'm not vegan so bring on the cheese please!!! They have a note on the menu that you cannot make any substitutions which I do abide by of course, hence this vegetarian suggestion :) ,My first order with them was a little upsetting, it was Cinco de Mayo so I knew they would be busy. I placed my order on their website and waited about 20 minutes to go get it assuming they would be behind. When I got there I found out that they never had received my order because they didn't turn on the website feature that day. Instead of quickly getting my order together because they were sorry I proceeded to wait almost another hour, I understand it was a very busy day for them but I probably won't go back just because of their lack of reaction. The food is very good and definitely recommend trying it out if you're in the area just don't trust ordering online!"
"1700 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33129",2/14/2016,$,5,Le Marché Cafe,"This place is amazing! The ambience is very laid back and the staff is so friendly, they make you feel welcomed. They have so many different options suitable for all diets: gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian and meat lovers. The coffee is awesome and they have different milk alternatives for those who prefer. The croissants are scrumptious and the soups are to die for. I would definitely recommend this place!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/7/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I ordered the gluten free Sergio for the first time today. I ordered it to go. The owners (from France) are both kind and helpful in explaining all of the options they have. My crepe was DELICIOUS, ORGANIC, and uniquely vegan. Though it was a crepe i didn't feel I sacrificed my clean eating approach. So lucky to have found this spot I will be back! Their vegan cheese is home made from veggies and so is their dressing!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/14/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,I spent a day in Miami and eating here was by far the best experience I had while I was there! The food was delicious. I had the crepe raw and I would definitely recommend it. I'm a vegan from Los Angeles so I was afraid of how limited my options would be while in Florida but this place did not disappoint. If I ever find myself in Miami again I will definitely stop by Eden in Eden again!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/10/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I am vegan and this is a wonderful place where I can eat things that have been a distant memory like quiche and crepes! Authentically french and wonderful food and service. Great for everyone, not just vegans."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/19/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"I came in here one morning and ordered one of their crepes and ordered a salad (which are huge by the way!!!). I never had a crepe before and it was really good. They give you options of having vegan cheese and it was just a bit too much for me. if you're a cheese lover, you will definitely love the crepe.,The salad was so yummy and fresh! The owner and her daughter were super polite!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/28/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This is my first time in Eden In Eden. It has a pretty good menu considering that it's a veggie/vegan place. It has quite ambience and good music playing. We ordered a burger and create your own sandwich. Both of them turned out to be pretty good, although the French baguette was very hard to bite. I won't have a chance to visit this place again I would love to try crepes at this place. Definitely recommend this place."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/17/2018,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"My visit to this cute french vegan restaurant was great. I ordered a crepe with kale, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes and it came with salad and avocado. I have never had a non vegan crepe so I cannot compare. However it will filling and tasty. The service was great. I will be back try more menu items, especially the vegan croissants."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",11/28/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I've had this place bookmarked for quite awhile but I don't live near so makes it tough for me to go. Finally went yesterday and it was worth the drive. I had the vegan tuna sandwich and it was the best tuna sandwich I've ever had! I already want to go back for more. Also ordered 2 empanadas, mixed veggie and soy picadillo, they were both delicious. The place is very nice and clean, wasn't loud at all and the service was great. Will be going again soon!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/3/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Vegan and gluten-free French crepes, quiches and galettes? Yes, please. A concept that is one of a kind in Miami. We ordered delivery, so I can't speak on the restaurant itself, only the food. ,The carrot ginger soup is a skip. Too watery and no flavor. ,The vegan mushroom quiche on the other hand, was delicious. The gluten-free crust was flaky and pretty darn perfect. The cheese substitute on top resembled grated parmesan somewhat, but if you ask me, it didn't need it. The filling had tons of umami. ,What really impressed me was the gluten-free vegan apple pie. Again, it's all in the crust. Hard to believe they can make a perfect pate brisee without butter. Incredibly crispy and flaky. Topped with simple apple slices that were just soft enough but still had some bite. ,The buckwheat crepe was delicious all on its on, with just a light sprinkle of sugar. Soft, delicate, simple. Highly recommend."
"5929 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/25/2018,$,5,SUR,Amazing! As a pescatarian I'm always on the hunt for a delicious tuna sandwich. This was by far the best tuna sandwich I've ever had ...

Imagine introducing marshmallow fluff to a 10 year with overbearing vegan parents. That reaction =my face.,I was on campus for a work event with full intentions of going to Versailles on the way home. Waiting for the event to end, ATT said I used all,My data this month, sooooo YOLO and I opened Yelp, fat fingered my way to events and found this.,First- thank you to the CM for letting me crash. ,This was actually overwhelming initially. Walk into a room with 50 strangers, bound together by the fact we all have enough free time (and lack of face to face convos) that we post on the internet. I kid, I kid. ,This is actually a bookstore, so a huge thank you to the owner for keeping this alive. Hopefully you'll add VHS movie nights soon? ,We're given a menu for the evenings tastings, paired with white and red. Im sure the actual wine is described, but I'm not that refined, nor attempt to be. ,5 separate sharing courses:,Arugula salad with figs and fancy ham (autocorrect and I don't know how to spell prochut),Smoked Fish dip,A tomatos and herbs on bread ,Chilled shrimp sandwich ,FRENCH TOAST ,100% executed perfectly. ,I hope I'm not the only one to think this, but kudos to the new chef for planning this meal they way she did. Every dish was designed to be simple, bold flavor and texture, and fool proof. ,What I mean by fool proof is that every dish was technically meant to be served at room temp, or slightly chilled, French toast not included. The menu is designed to allow refires if needed hat won't hold the kitchen up...... a moot point considering she killed it. ,Lastly, I can finally feel vindicated in the ever lasting argument with my gf that French toast is actually a dessert  and not breakfast. ,I'm not in MIA often but very much looking forward to coming back"

I may make it a weekly thing since the vegan burger is only 6.99!!!  Oh, they also have some vegan grocery items and since they are french, my daughter loves that there are eiffel towers everywhere!  Monique will sometimes have her kids there and so it is so family friendly.  Go now!!"

"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/10/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"This is a cute clean restaurant with light tasty food and a variety of options. I took a group here and everyone found something they liked. The Chausson appetizer (particular the one with veggie ham) is like an empanada and is quite tasty. The vegan quiche was to die for! It has a whole wheat crust so you don't feel as guilty eating it. My friend had a salad that came with quinoa and veggie ""turkey"" that she enjoyed. The carob crepe for dessert was a hit with the non vegans in the group, including the one who lived in France. The staff is very nice. I would definitely go back here again...and soon! They also have a little fridge where they sell some vegetarian products, ex: nutritional yeast, almond milk."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",11/6/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,The owner is from Paris & the food can be vegetarian or vegan.  I love the concept & I love the Crepes!  They also sell vegan products. I tried the Vegan ice cream (Dolce Peccati) & it was surprisingly delicious. They also make fresh vegetable drinks.  A great find!

I also had the crepes with fruit and it was delicious as well. The ambiance is good for a small restaurant. It was also very inspiring to see the owner and her family running the place. I highly recommend this place. ,Follow me on IG - @mike_baptiste"

Do yourself a favor and try the crepe Sergio and croque monsieur. The acai bowl is also very tasty. Best acai in town! The freshest most delicious juices in the land"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/29/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This was my first time here and finding vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Miami isn't the easiest! I am vegan so I was quite excited. First I ordered the Eden Salad, I'm not a huge fan of Kale, but the way they chopped it up and mixed it with spinach made it yummy! There are also roasted veggies on a skewer on top which is seasoned and cooked perfectly. The salad dressing was yummmy!,I also ordered their soup of the day, which was lentil. Delicious. I should've taken some home it was so good ,Overall, it's a cute, clean, and small place but I definitely am coming back.,I highly recommend!"

Definitely a different kind of vegetarian restaurant that deserves your attention. Portions are good (hard to find at a lot of veggie places) and everything there is vegan-friendly so you can go WILD. Highly recommended!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/8/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"What a wonderful place!!! Is very much needed to have an oasis of home made food in this area. The food is carefully made, it has love and the most important thing is that is all the food is prepared to the highest Vegan standards. ,It is all well paired together and the combinations available are phenomenal. ,The ambiance is casual, colorful and with a French flair. ,It is just wonderful to have a healthier, animal-free option in such a good location.,Highly recommended..."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/20/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Nothing short of sinfully delicious for a simple herb and cheese crepe. I highly recommend this spot for lunch, they're incredibly mindful with your time and craft insanely tasty treats that could fool non-vegans. At first impression I wondered how this spot could pull off Parisian inspired cuisine on a vegan whim and was delighted with a generously portioned melty gooey crepe with vegan cheese, leeks and herbs.,You could of fooled me into thinking it was Gouda. It wasn't insipid or lacking in texture like most vegan attempts in the area.,They also have vegan ham and turkey..a fridge with items for sale..and delivery!!,Will return again! Tres Bon!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/30/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Because I'm vegan, I rarely frequent French restaurants. Eden & Eden changed that for me! I enjoyed a mushroom crepe and a chocolate dessert crepe. Both were delicious. The atmosphere is bright and airy, small but not cramped. It is a perfect place for a lunch date. The service was a bit slow, but everyone was friendly. There is ample street parking out front. I like that they sell some vegan goods on the shelves (almond milk, cereal, chia). I will definitely be back!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/16/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,The food is delicious. My favorite is the gluten free quiche. The owner/chef is awesome. I love everything about this place. Right down to her French accent. Yes. Yes. Yes. To all. Vegans and non vegans will enjoy the tasty organic French foods.

I am a vegetarian but often find myself looking for options to eat out other than the regular ""salad"" or pasta dish that traditional places serve. I ordered the spinach quiche and it was great! Definitely returning to try other items in the menu."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/14/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,The most delicious vegan food I've ever had. If you're vegan or thinking about becoming one this is the best place to go. Everything is fresh and top notch quality.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/18/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,I had the vegan croque monsieur. It was very flavorful. My friend and I were both impressed. The lady who runs the restaurant is from Paris and indulged my poor French. She was very nice and clearly passionate about her food which was refreshing to see. I highly recommend this restaurant.

With it I had the small Parisienne salad without the vegan chicken. And last, but not least, an apple pie.  Something I haven't had in years.,I will be a frequent customer from now on!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/23/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"We were originally going to a spot next door, but changed our mind when we saw this place. Vegetarian and vegan food? Yes! My boyfriend and I both ordered the Croque monsieur. Delicious!!!!!! I can't wait to come back :)"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/5/2014,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"I was excited to come this place since I am vegetarian, but I am not mainly because of the price and the service. When you walk into a new place that has opened and you are the only ones in there, usually the staff might greet with you a warm welcome and questions like is this your first time, would you like some recommendations, something. The guys barely got a hello out and then I asked him for his favorite thing on the menu and he said the CREPES CHAMPIGNONS which I got. My hubby settled for the QUICHE VEGAN with spinach.,The food came out pretty quickly and was served a sauce that we dipped our food in. The crepe was ok, nothing spectacular and I wouldn't call it the best thing on the menu. My husband's quiche was pretty good and I would come back for it. The only problem I have with the place is the lack of excitement from the staff and the prices. On their website the prices are $8.50, but we were charged $13 for each item which I don't think the ambiance and the food is worth that."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/17/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,A vegan or vegetarians paradise. I had the taboulet salad which was very generous in portion size and delicious. The vegetarian white ham in the salad was so tasty and really tasted like ham. So large I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Really recommend this place.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/30/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"My fiancée and I were very impressed with the food options and great service at this quaint little cafe. I give them kudos for being innovative and bringing up this new concept..French/Vegan cuisine. It was refreshing to step into a vegan place that offered more than just salads and wraps. We had the vegan sausage quiche, ginger/carrot soup and a smoothie. They all were all delicious. I also liked the fact that the portions were fairly big (compared to most vegan places) and the quiche was warm, hearty and filling so it definitely hit the spot for me. I'm sometimes left feeling a little hungry after eating at some vegan spots, but not the case this time!,The place was clean and had a very positive vibe to it. You can tell they put a lot of effort into opening and managing it. It's a family operated restaurant so it seems like it's been a labor of love for the owners which is always great to see. It's located in the silver bluff neighborhood, which is up an coming with great new restaurants and things to do everywhere. Overall...it was a great experience and we will definitely be going back. Great food, interesting vegan options and quality service = FIVE STARS!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/20/2015,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I love this place!  The food is delicious. Staff is kind and helpful. Crepe Sergio is my favorite. Very interesting concept, French Vegan. It is a little pricey for a juice spot but the fresh ingredients and quality is worth it. They also deliver, which is a great."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/9/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"At first I was a but hesitant since some things stated raw in the menu, I was thinking this would be the super healthy veg place. After eating I was surprised by how delicious and flavorful all the food was. We tried the vegan sausage quiche, made our own tofu sandwich, and tried the eden burger. All where delish and their sausage isn't like other vegan places that use Seiten and taste like cardboard with sauce. This was amazing and flavorful with its own flavor. We also tried two smoothies which were heavenly and not too sweet. I would come here again, if I lived here I'd stop by a couple times a week."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/10/2016,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"French Vegan CAFE. That's pretty unique, if you asked me. No froufrou restaurant here, but a casual place that does what seems to be primarily crepes (although they have other things going on in the menu too).,And as far as vegan crepes go, it was pretty good. And it was also surprisingly large (but it should have been, if the one I ordered was $12.50 anyways). But I'm not sure if I would go back to order it again - partly because I love well-made non-vegan crepes too much. These were made without eggs and dairy.,And would I come back for the quiches? Well... again, these have no eggs and dairy. And with so many quiches being available around town... yeah, I wouldn't... but it's not you. It's me. I'm sure they're great for those who have forsaken the cluck-cluck of the chickens. But I'm sure I'd be willing to take a bite of my vegan friend's order, if we do end up here again.,I had the CREPE SERGIO which comes with kale, mushrooms, spinach, dried tomatoes, and avocado. All healthy, and pretty tasty. And it's a good option for vegetarians/vegans in case if they're looking for something different."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/5/2017,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"Great idea but just wasn't blown away and found the service to be poor and the prices to be unreasonable. They had a vast selection of vegan options which I thought was great, but if I can summarize the dishes using one word it'd be ""meh"". The flavor just wasn't there. My partner and I ordered the raw crepe and the croque sandwich. You do get decent portions but you're paying over $10 for a crepe so I would hope it was a decent size. Overall, it was a decent stop and glad to see Miami has vegan establishments but it just didn't hit the spot."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/5/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Hole in the wall , literally due to the size and location.the food is interesting , lots of options and all vegan or vegetarian .super tasty with aFrench influence .it is a little pricey so beware and lastly it does take forever so don't go when in a rush or press for time .instead bring a book and come enjoy some fresh ingredients and colorful good meal and one of the most hospitable service ever .ps:parking isn't easy"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/23/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This is probably the healthiest place to eat in Miami, if your looking for raw vegan food and raw vegan treats this is it They also have some yummy vegan cooked items like vegan empanadas, soups, and even crepes! its a french place so cute :D"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/12/2016,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Vegan food can't get any easier than this! I ordered delivery via Yelp, while also getting an eye for what others had posted pics of and reccomended. I ordered the cleaning smoothie ($8.95) and the crepe champignons ($10.80), then was charged $4.00 delivery fee. I don't think that's too expensive, especially compared to other restaurants with delivery in the area. The food arrived within 45 minutes, and the delivery guy actually made the effort to come up to my door (which is rare at my complex). The cleaning smoothie is pretty much the greenest smoothie you can get, because of the kale. But it's not bitter, you can still taste the fruit (banana, pear and pineapple) in it. It was a great tasting smoothie (and I am hoping healthy!), but I wish there was more ice put into the blender. It was less like a smoothie and more like a thicker juice - think of milkshake consistency. The crepe champignons was so good, you can't even tell the cheese is vegan cheese. It tastes just like parmesean. It has a great blend of ingredients and was a really large portion, I couldn't finish my entire meal so I had leftovers. I am excited to order from here again and try different options!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/12/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Definitely the best smoothies in the area. The food is excellent, and very healthy. AmaZing place if your a vegan or health nut, but great for anyone as well. The owners are very nice French people. A hidden gem on coral way!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/8/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"The place is kind of magical place with music from fairy tales, We tried  5 different vegan restaurant in Miami, this one offers something different, with French atmosphere style every dishes becomes dream, maybe because of the extraordinary service, or the wonderful chef but when you hungry you will be pleased  after eating.,First We took the Carrot-Ginger soup that was o.k but not enough salty so added ""herbamare"" that was on the table and then it was great.,For the main we took special scrambled Tofu with onions and mushrooms and it was delicious. ,We also took the quiche that was very nice and soft and warm with European Salad (for the health..) was very fresh.,Lastly we ordered the ,Bottom line:,The place is cozy small and warm and really inviting you like family.,The service is warm and wonderful and you can ask for anything they will be happy to make you. ,And lastly it offers something little different for vegans.,Go visit!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/11/2015,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"I set the standard pretty tall for vegan restaurants mainly because I visit so many of them in different cities. I'm also vegan myself and a decent cook, so by no means is my review to be interpreted as a negative one...just a snobby one. ,The restaurant serves mostly salads, juices, and sandwiches. I was in the mood for cooked food and found a mushroom quiche on the menu. It was very flavorful, but unfortunately not filling ($10 for a slice with a few leaves of salad). Perhaps that is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to vegan restaurants: small portions paired with high prices for meals that are not terribly complex. ,I would recommend coming here for a light lunch or appetizer or perhaps to try one of their many juice combos. The staff is amicable and eager to help you pick out a menu item."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/12/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Extensive vegan menu, courteous service and my husband says the best fresh orange juice he ever tasted. Clean and peaceful atmosphere."
"150 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/11/2017,$$,5,The Local Craft Food & Drink,"I was incredibly surprised by the service here on a Saturday morning. We were a party of 10 hungover wedding goers from the night before that strolled in unannounced to this tiny gem. It was anyone's nightmare. To my surprise, we were greeted with a warm smile and they seated us right away. The highlight of the day was when the chef approached our table after one of our friends needed a vegan dish. He made sure to add all of the acceptable ingredients and whipped a magical salad for him. Funny enough, even the meat eaters were jealous of such a delicious and aesthetically pleasing dish. They won my heart immediately."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",8/9/2015,$$$,4,Texas de Brazil,"For all the meat-lovers out there, Texas de Brazil is everything you could want. I went to the Dadeland Mall location this past Friday for lunch and everyone in my party loved it, except my one vegan co-worker. The meal starts with a trip to the buffet which in addition to the usual salad bar items has a delicious lobster bisque, cheesy gratin potatoes, and a wide selection of cured meats. But the real fun starts when you sit back down at your table and flip your card to green. The staff comes around with a large variety of different meats for you to choose from. I cannot remember everything I had but I was a big fan of the flank steak, chicken breast in bacon, and the pork loin. Waiters continue to circle your table with different meats until every card is turned back to red and no one can eat another bite, if you can even move. For lunch it is only $27, which is honestly a great value. The only real issue is that you will find that your productivity will come to an end as you can hardly move let alone think when you return to work. I know I will be back."
"12560 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",7/30/2016,$,3,Jamrock Cuisine,Let me just say this review is a bit skewed because I do not eat meat. They only have 2 plates curry tofu & jerk tofu and no veggie patties available that day. I tried the jerk tofu chop. The rice and peas & salad were good but the tofu had no texture. I have eaten tofu prepared all kind of ways but this was just the block of tofu straight out the package. Maybe if I ate all the other plates with meat my rate would be higher. If you are vegan/vegetarian this is not your place.
"49 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",7/20/2012,$$,5,SuViche Brickell,Excellent Vegan roll with macadamia nuts.
"49 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",4/29/2018,$$,5,SuViche Brickell,Great spot! Super fresh and vegan friendly. The veggie sushi roll is the best in the area! I am also in love with the toasted corn they bring for the table. Outside seating is beat as this is a very small space.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/9/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I discovered this restaurant while I was looking for some quick and casual vegan options in Miami. What a delightful little neighborhood bistro! The food was great, the owner was friendly and attentive, nice options for a vegan diner, and it had a real nice vibe. Will definitely return."

Try the empanadas. you have to."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/6/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Leaving for Spain tomorrow. We heard about this NEW restaurant and had to give it a shot. WOW! Started with wine and Tartar, then Empanadas,brie bacon and date,  a real treat! More wine then pizza. The table next to us ordered Nutella pizza for desert. They gave us a taste. Mmmmmmmmmm so GOOD! Great atmosphere! AWESOME food and drink! Meat if you like or VEGAN if you choose. Service with a personal touch. Definitely going back."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Service wa great. Tiny place, cozy, comfy. Glad that there are vegan options, as well as organic and grassfed... all points for that. I had empanadas, was good but did not impress me - the reason for 3 stars."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Absolutely love this place! The food is very fresh and super delicious! A wide variety of empanadas, pizzas, (even vegan options available) tacos and not to forget the guacamole which was out of this world!!! I will be back very soon!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/30/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"the vegan, gluten free pizzas tasted like the freezer that had been in :-(  nothing especially fresh or healthy."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2016,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Very nice place, cozy feeling and great taste. Artisanal baked empanadas, Argentinean flavour! Also a wide variety of pizzas, also Gluten-free pizzas, vegan meatballs and more."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/18/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,Vegans! This is the new spot! The choices here are great and the employees are so nice and knowledgeable. The empanadas and pizzas are too die for. Can't wait to try more things on the menu  literally eating the new vegan empanada as you read this. I'm drooling hahaha
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/28/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,So many delicious vegan options! Even my non-vegans ate them instead. Staff is very informative and nice! A must when I'm in South Florida. My friend ended leaving with a half dozen frozen empanadas.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,I love this place. I've only been twice. But each time the food is so so good. The vegan chorizo pizza and the vegan empanadas are beyond. The owner is so cute and the spot itself feels warm & cozy. A must try and repeat!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,My son and I ate vegan today. We had berry guacamole and pizza. My son is helping me embrace this vegan lifestyle. He hasn't said no trying anything yet and he actually asked to come back to this restaraunt. Great job
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/21/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Yaaas yaaas yaaas! I don't know why I waited so long to come here!! Lots of vegetarian and vegan options! Empanadas are delish! Come from 4-7 for happy hour! 2 empanadas and a drink for $7! Friendly, aesthetically pleasing, cozy and good food! Will def become my go to spot."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Wow. What an amazing place. I loved everything from the decor, to the vibe. But let me tell you about the food. We took the owner's recommendations and had their signature empanadas that are made in a wood burning oven. To die for!! We had a delicious coconut butternutsquash soup. We also had blackened grilled fish tacos that were bomb. They have an amazing vegan & vegetarian selection. The owner Fufi is super passionate about everything in her restaurant and it showed. This is definitely our new spot in Miami. 5 star!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/15/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I'm not vegan, but visiting Fufi with a couple of friends and loved it. Great food  and the service was awesome too. Will go back again."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"FUFI is a hip, fresh and affordable restaurant. Their happy hour (Monday- Friday from 4pm-7pm) is the most amazing deal I have yet to receive in Miami. You receive two homemade baked (not fried!) empanadas and one drink of your choice for 7$ total. I ordered a special eggplant curry empanada and a spinach mozzarella empanada. Both were delicious. The sangria I ordered was not to my liking, but it was a very generous drink portion, and came with an edible flower! I also split the vegan pizza and substituted mozzarella for the vegan cheese. My friend who shared it with me is huge meat eater, and even he loved it. The service at Fufi was great, and we received our food with a reasonable wait time. The restaurant isn't close to my neighborhood, but I definitely plan to be back, likely for happy hour"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/4/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Love their empanadas and this small little neighborhood joint in Buena vista. Fufi is always here and very welcoming. My favorite is the ""beef"" garden. How can something vegan be so good! To die for!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,Yummy Vegan food in Wynwood area.  It's a small place but there is outside seating.  Service and price is great.   I would highly recommend and will be returning.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/5/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"*vegans/vegetarians/folks with food sensitivities double check your food* ,Y'all. I was soooo excited to try this restaurant. Argentine-style empanadas? Yay! Vegan options? Omg! They completely had me before I stepped foot in the restaurant. I even made the drive down all the way from Ft Lauderdale. ,When I first arrived, the bartender/server was quite kind and very attentive. I placed my order for 2 vegan empanadas, a glass of their Argentine rosé and their soup of the day (potato leek). ,I was promptly served my rosé and it was delish. I couldn't wait to try my food! ,This is where things took a turn for the worst. Folks started to trickle in after me but their food came out before mine. I'm thinking, no biggie. Maybe the vegan empanadas take longer to bake? ,30 minutes go by and I haven't even gotten my soup. I'm a super patient person but at this point I'm a bit concerned. 45 minutes have now gone by and not even a mention of where my food is. My server has not acknowledged how long it's taken and everyone around me is enjoying their soups, appetizers, deserts and empanadas. What happened to my kind, attentive server?,At this point, I'm just hungry :( ,Finally my food comes out all at once. I'm almost finished with my wine. I would have normally ordered another glass but I'm a bit over it at this point. ,I try the soup and it could use a bit more flavor but it'll do. I try one of my empanadas, the vegan chorizo and it was okay. Again, it was missing a bit of something but it will do. ,I then bite into my second empanada and I don't even recognize what I'm eating. ""Oh, this is cheese"" I think to myself. ,*sigh* I'm super sensitive to dairy. ,I call my server over who is confused as to how this could happen. She assures me that she put in the right order (I completely believe her) and that there was a mixup with the kitchen. ,She kindly did not charge me for my empanada and gave me a discount on the wine. ,There seems to be other diners who have had this problem so I think this is something that Fufi should look into just a bit more. ,This place has the potential to be phenomenal but I just can't give it more than 3 stars after such a long wait for food I couldn't even eat. ,+1 for the private parking behind the restaurant."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/29/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Ordered two vegan pizzas for my birthday, they sounded really good and looked even better when they arrived. Only problem is that BOTH pies weren't cut, at all. We literally had to use my plastic cake knife and a butter knife to cut the pies. Wish they tasted better for all the hard work we put into cutting them!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Where do I start?! This place is amazing. I've been coming here for two years and I have only seen great growth. The hospitality and atmosphere is just warm and inviting. Florencia's empanadas are delicious and huge in variety, i am vegan and she has so many vegan options. You can't go wrong with anything it's all so delicious and nourishing. They even have a vegan apple empanada coconut milk ice cream dessert. I mean you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have a great happy hour 4-7 pm two empanadas and a drink. Mexican pizza is delicious. Just try it for yourself you'll love it!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/3/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Nicely welcomed our party of 8 without a reservation. Fufi was amazingly nice and explain the menu and history of the business. I got the lunch special of salad, soup, and chicken and beef empanadas. I loved the salad dressing and the lentil soup, but the empanadas were amazing! They have vegan, vegetarian, and meat options. The dough was crispy and the filling tasted great. Highly recommend!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"We came right as they opened on a Monday, so the place was very clean and the one employee that was working the front of house was extremely polite. We ordered one of each of the vegan empanadas, along with the vegan Mexican pizza. It took almost an hour to receive our food, there were also people waiting pretty long at the bar to pick up to-go orders. The mexican pizza was delicious, my only ""complaint"" would be the vegan cheese they use doesn't melt so it was falling off and quite messy to eat. The garden and beef garden empanadas were the best, so flavorful and piping hot. The curry empanada wasn't bad, just a bit bland. We used a bit of their hot sauce on everything though, which were so spicy and tasty, but even they didn't redeem the curry flavor. Our chorizo empanada came out last, yet it was a bit cold inside. The flavor was also blah, like a can of tomatoey beans inside dough, but my boyfriend actually liked it. But the crust itself on all the empanadas was spot on, perfectly crispy and delicious. They are also small, but not too pricey. I wish we got to try the apple pie dessert, but we were scared it would add another half hour to our stay. Overall, it was a cute small restaurant with lots of vegan options and great service, we will go again on our next trip to Miami."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/5/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I took my son's aunt there for her birthday - specifically for their vegan options. We were welcomed warmly by the owner and she really went above and beyond making my sister in law feel special on her birthday. Created  a special vegan birthday creation empanada just for her. ,We ordered the steak, bacon/Brie/date, and curried eggplant empanadas and they were all fantastic. We also got the Gaia vegan pizza which was just as delicious and berry guacamole. Chicken tacos were ordered for my son - and although he gobbled them up, I honestly would have just ordered the chicken empanadas instead since it's the same filling.,It was a great experience with options for both vegans and meat eaters to enjoy, and the owner was a joy to chat with."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/27/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Gotta hand it to Fufi. In this culinary wasteland called Miami, they're really trying to do their best for us vegans.,The empanadas here really hit the spot. Just don't catch them on a sloppy day or they'll be cold on the inside. Hit or miss I'd say. The waitresses also tend to confuse what's vegan and what isn't.,I've tried some other stuff on the menu and just like most other vegan options in Miami, it's a sad substitute that ""gets the job done"" for most people. But it's still expensive and bland.,Good enough."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I stopped by Fufi because I heard they had vegan options on their menu. That's an understatement - they have so many options for every craving and I was shocked at how many off menu items they had when I mentioned I was vegan. The service here may actually be the best experience I've had in Miami and the owners are so welcoming you'll feel like family.  List of absolute must try items:,Mushroom empanadas - mixture of three different types of mushrooms with garlic and onions (vegan),Vegan beef empanadas - vegan beef crumbles, peppers and onions with a special chipotle sauce on the side,Gaia vegan pizza - vegan mozzarella, roasted eggplant, onions, peppers, arugula and balsamic drizzle,Vegan apple empanadas with a side of vegan vanilla ice cream - don't be alarmed if a tear falls from your eye when you taste it"
"11865 SW 26th St, Miami, FL 33175",4/7/2016,$$,5,Sushi 2 Mee,This place is awesome. They listen to what you order and will literally deliver almost anywhere. Finally a place that doesn't compromise their quality of food and service. Plus I'm vegan and I can eat happily
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,The restaurant is very hippy like and very casual. I think it's a little to pricey for the type of food. I didn't like my vegan pizza meanly because it was way to greasy for my liking and it didn't have a lot of flavor. I wouldn't go back there. The service was nice
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Oh my oh my oh my the Vegan options abound at this amazing eatery! Let's start with the  delicious Malbec pairing with the berry guacamole which is so unique and delightful!! Guac with pomegranate and dried cranberries...sooo much more amazing than you would think!! We ordered ALL of the vegan empanadas and the faves were the Chorizo and the Beef Garden but my god all were fabulous!! ,Service is amazing. She is letting us just chill through this crazy thunderstorm. P.s. parking is in back off 46th Street!!! Come and try you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Vegan empanadas are great, just be sure to double check that they give you the vegan version!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/9/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"I was looking for a healthyish dish after one of my occasional gym jaunts, and was drawn to Fufi - I'm going to sound like our orange hued leader - but by a cute girl who was noshing outside as I drove by. I did chat with her, found she was not an employee and even (gasp) vegan. But you guys should definitely hire her for marketing =),As noted, they have outside seating and I learned they are dog friendly, so Princess Luna will make a visit sometime.,But anyway, back to my dinner. Fufi's has a menu with broad appeal to both vegans and omnivores. Trying to balance both worlds, I ordered their taco salad (with added chicken of course). You know I like my food seasoned and customized, and I wasn't disadppointed. For one, they took out the avocado (not allergic, just OCD against it). The cilantro dressing was rich and tasty without being overwhelming,  and there was plenty of cheese and tomatoes.,Me being me, despite the gym, ordered their apple pie (though I customized out the ice cream). This deliciousness has a thin crust, plenty of apples and nuts- see, fruits - and a light cinnamon taste. It's definitely a good close to my meal."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/1/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Fufi's is great for everyone. They have meat options as well as plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. If you decide to eat here I suggest the empanadas. That's what they are known for and they are excellent! (I ordered the pizza once, it wasn't bad but like I said stick to the empanadas). ,Fufi's is a small and adorable cafe located in Buena vista right next to Lemoni cafe. The owner is Argentinean and prides herself in making great empanadas. All of the vegan empanadas are delicious and she will test different flavors adding new ones to the menu which always keeps things infesting. My favorite is the garden meat (she uses the ground meat from Atlas) and the chorizo and bean. Other flavors include, eggplant curry, creamy corn, mushroom and goat cheese and many more. ,In addition to empanadas, she also serves tacos, pizza and apps. Their soup of the day is always vegetarian friendly and each time more delicious than the last. ,I recommend ordering a cup of the daily soup, a few empanadas and an Argentinean wine. Then sit back and enjoy yourself. ,P.s I took one star off only because almost every time my empanada order gets mixed up. Although they do fix my order, it's happened several times.,But I come back anyway !,Tips:,Yelp check in offer- one free empanada ,happy hour special. 2 empanadas and a drink for 7$. ,Outdoor seating available,Dog friendly"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/6/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"This is a great little hidden spot! The service was friendly and they made my friend and I feel really welcome. The decor was very quaint with a lot of beautiful plant life around the restaurant. It isn't very big but it is very comfortable and feels a bit more intimate that way. It is a bit pricey but quite worth it for the quality ingredients. The restaurant is also vegan and gluten free friendly, with clear markings on the menu listings.  ,Their empanadas are definitely what first attracted me to try them but other selections, such as tacos and pizza, are also great choices. ,The caramelized onion, mushroom and goat cheese empanada was listed as a ""people's favorite"", and I can see why! The flavors blended together perfectly. The eggplant curry empanada was also very rich in spices and flavor. We also enjoyed the berry guacamole; it was a combination I had never thought to try but the flavor contrast worked so so well together! A great start to our meal already. ,For my entrée I had the fungi pizza, containing mozzarella, truffle oil and several types of mushroom. It felt very sophisticated compared to your typical pie. It was not too oily and the mushrooms were cooked so they were flavorful and soft. Every option for pizza was very unique and I love the different spin they put on this area of their dishes. It turns an option that can easily be one dimensional and boring into something exciting with depth. ,For dessert I had the homemade tiramisu. It was creamy and delicious, while still not being too heavy. Cutting into it with the spoon was so easy and oh so satisfying. We were also pleasantly surprised with a sparkler and candle for our little birthday celebration! ,It was all very sweet and I definitely hope to return soon!! Quality ingredients and a great environment. Fufi easily earns 5 stars from me."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/19/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Mushrooms, caramelized onions and goat cheese is my favorite empanada! Pizzas are delicious and vegans have many options to try.,Great atmosphere, inside and outside, although a bit noisy."
"5335 NW 87th Ave, Doral, FL 33178",5/11/2018,$$,5,Bulla Gastrobar,"Wow! What an amazing happy hour!! The white wine sangria is amazing!  Only it isn't white wine, it's like a prosecco? Idk, it's delicious.  Equally fantastic is the beer sangria.  I must be a sangria girl because I was living for these drinks. The tapas were so yummy, too. DO get the patatas bravas.  Another hearty and tasty tapa was the ""Huevos Bulla"" - that was ""slap yo momma"" good.  The tostada de aguacate is delicious and vegan!  I wish I would've taken pics of the food but we were busy going in!! Our waitress was attentive and checked on us often!  The manager, Shelly, is the bomb!  She checked on us, made recommendations, was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, (duh, she's the manager), and was funny!  Honestly I haven't had a good night out like this in a while. I read other posts saying the place is expensive. Honestly, I felt like I got what I paid for and maybe even more.  The atmosphere, food, and service was on point! I look forward to visiting Bulla again."
"9005 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",10/8/2017,$,5,Lime Fresh Mexican Grill,"I love this place! I was a little worried they wouldn't have any vegan options but they can make anything vegetarian and with a few changes and some guacamole to the mix I had hands down the best bean burrito. Their variety of hot sauces was so amazing I couldn't pick just one. Don't even get me started on the bean and corn salsa! I wanted to take the whole container home. It's a big college student hotspot and a great after school, work, life hangout! With Great food and great hospitality this is my go too Mexican food destination!"
"11740 SW 104th St, Miami, FL 33186",4/5/2017,$$,4,Killian Cafe & Grill,"I have visited a few times for breakfast only and haven't been disappointed yet. I usually get the Portobello crepe which comes with feta cheese and spinach and a side salad(I know its weird for breakfast but I don't like eggs, bacon etc...) This is very tasty and filling as well. I also had their cinnamon & sugar crepe that was very good too. I would of given 5 stars if they had more options for vegetarians/vegan. All in all it is a very good restaurant."
"11740 SW 104th St, Miami, FL 33186",4/22/2018,$$,4,Killian Cafe & Grill,"So out for Sunday brunch on our new motorcycle I like to try new places to eat . I saw Killian Café had good reviews and thought to try it . We arrived and there was a little bit of a waiting line . Which I always think that is a good thing  . We were called to our outside table ,which was nice .  I am vegan and knew that I have to special order my food , which I did but unfortunately the waitress misunderstood and ordered my food with mozzarella. I explained again I am vegan and didn't want any cheese on my food . She proceed to blame me for her not understanding my order. I told her just give me sautéed veggies . She came back with only mushrooms with spinach . I looked at it and thought well she is not getting a tip.  Then I ordered a side of toast to eat with it . A gentleman ( which I mistook for the chef ) had come out early to offer coffee and see if things were good . He Had come out again  to see what happen . I explained and he offered to remake it . He was extreme nice , I decline as I was getting full from my mushroom and toast and asked if he was the chef . He explain he was the owner and apologies for the misunderstanding . He also took off the mushroom from the bill , Because of his nice hospitality and attentiveness. I give this restursnt 4 stars And tip her after all . Plus My wife's food came out fast and was good and filling. We will come back again for a 2nd try :)"
"709 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/4/2017,$$,5,The Anderson,"Totally recommend this bar! Awesome vibe with music at perfect volume so great for a first date or group gatherings. I can tell it's a popular place judging by how crowded it was by 11 on the Saturday that I went. Delicious cocktails that change every three months. Food was also a hit. I'm vegan so they made an awesome vegan wrap for me that I can't wait to order again. There's street parking but also for convenience, valet for only $5."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/2/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Very good junk food for the vegan soul! The patty melt is amazing and the staff is super nice I recommend this spot! They also have salads too but I mean they burnt tips , fried chicken, patty melts , this place will blow your mind"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/3/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Groupon introduced us to this great experience of a dine. It was a little difficult to find at first but once we did, we were amazed how crowded the small area was that housed the food truck. All of the items on the menu were vegan. We ordered the Rachael on Rye, the Island Patty Melt and an order of the loaded fries. All were thoroughly enjoyed! We will definitely be coming back!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/6/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Great vegan food, great set up! Try their burgers and their fries are amazing! Expect to pay over $10 if you want more than a burger. They are friendly as well. The only downfall is the parking...but Im not knocking a star for that! Either you find free parking around or you pay for parking on 79th street. I highly recommend it."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/14/2016,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Delicious ! Delicious!  I had the nachos and the "" le bleu""   Sandwich and I was in vegan heaven! Highly recommend"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/22/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is awesome!! I heard about Atlas from a vendor at the Yellow Green Market (also amazing). Shortly after I saw a Groupon and immediately purchased it. I brought my carnivorous husband who usually hates vegan food and we both loved our homestyle vegan sandwiches. I got the buttermilk chicken which was the best vegan chicken I have ever had with waffle fries, ""cheese"" sauce, and a root beer. My husband got the tips  sandwich, which I tried but honestly tasted too much like meat to me and freaked me out, so there really is something for every type of vegan here. Vegans who don't like meat and want something delicious, and vegans who miss the taste of meat. The setting was adorable and the vegan community around was wonderful, it was great to talk to other people with a similar frame of mind when it comes to diet. The guy who took our order was wonderful, super friendly, best customer service I've ever had in Miami. This was such a treat. There are other vegan places I'm honestly not crazy about and this was just a great experience with amazing food."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/5/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,ordered the Kansas city burnt tips which were so finger licking good with loaded fries that made me do the happy dance. I also ordered the wood bone wings which wasn't for me. 2 minutes away from my house so definitely will be trying out more. Way better than other vegan options in the area.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/18/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Hands down best vegan burgers and food EVER. Forget the overrated, overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. Atlas has the most flavorful foods, it all tastes different. Best part? GREAT, if not perfect customer service, it's usually quite busy, but you barely have to wait for your food."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/5/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is just amazing! I don't know where to start, they have options for everyone the food is so amazing for new to vegan or not vegan at all I promise you will still love it!

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/27/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I ended up trying this place since I've been to a few local restaurants offering their products. I love how chill and relaxed the food truck is, it's very reminiscent of the Wynwood Yard! Plenty of parking in adjacent streets. I got the burger, which was okay! But my goodness are those loaded fries delicious!!! It's definitely vegan junk food at it's best."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/2/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,The best. Perfect location & delicious food. Friendly staff. Can't wait for their extended hours to start & hopefully for them to open on mondays. The chkn sandwich is my favorite & they also provide the meat for the vegan jambalaya at kush which is also great! Thank you for existing

The loaded fries are the stuff vegan dreams are made of. It also feels really good to have the opportunity to support a local, all vegan business."

GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT SERVICE AND THE BEST OF ALL THEY ARE THE BEST VEGAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN!!!!!! Literally no one cant compete. This was my first vegan food i ever tried. I had the burnt tips sandwich with fries. Oh man let me tell you i never tasted something like this. This literally turn me out to eat healthier and search healthier alternatives. You guys changed my lifestyle!"

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/15/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,I was in town for vacation and wanted raw options. Saw this place on HappyCow and booked a reservation simply because I saw they had raw options. I hadn't looked at the menu or even looked up the restaurant. Boy was I BLOWN AWAY! This was the best raw vegan dining experience I will probably ever have. The staff here is exquisite and elegant. The food is portioned very nicely and has such beautiful presentation. Most of the food is sourced locally and is organic. No gluten in house which is amazing! Also the atmosphere of this place is absolutely incredible. I've never been at such a beautiful restaurant. I had such a beautiful experience here and I am so happy I came.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/19/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Simply....outstanding. The setting is a beautiful zen environment surrounded by water, plants and trees while in the middle of Wynwood. The food is absolutely incredible, vegan or not. I had the celery root lasagne and my husband had the tamale. I honestly don't know which one I liked better! I wanted more of each. The drinks were delicious as well and great service by everyone there. It's not cheap but it's definitely worth every penny!"
"9251 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",4/18/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"This place is so amazing ! Free almost unlimited parking, and an outdoor seating area if you don't want to watch TV or hear the music. We were greeted right when we came in, the guy (I wish I got his name he is so attentive somebody give that boy a raise/promotion ! He was skinny and a little tall) I had never been here but have heard many great things and my boyfriend tried it last week and has gone back three times this week so I just had to try it. I'm vegan and he's not so I was a little skeptical if I was gonna find anything for me. I ordered their veggie burger minus the Cheese and pincho sauce. The veggie burger was amazing the only thing, it's not a burger. It's just mashed black beans with a couple other ingredients and it's just missing a little more seasoning. But I can't use this against them because they aren't a place who specifically caters vegans so im grateful to just have that option. Also the fricken sweet potato tater tots !! Oh my geez, why didn't I know what apple butter was before ? Who thought of this ? Whoever did I love you forever ! The flavors were so good and even though I'm vegan I can pin point good meat and my boyfriends steak pincho looked so JUICY. He also orders shrimp pinchos which looked perfectly cooked. Golden on the outsides and pink on the inside. I really love this place and the way the young man treated us ! This automatically became one of my go-to places in the area"

"8405 Mills Dr, Kendall, FL 33183",1/1/2016,$$,5,Pisco Y Nazca,"Loving the architecture and design of this place. Amazing environment, great service and even better food! Don't even get me started about the cocktails. The barlotto was delicious, and they even custom made my order to be vegan as I told my server about my special diet. So happy I visited, definitely going back soon!"
"8405 Mills Dr, Kendall, FL 33183",3/29/2018,$$,3,Pisco Y Nazca,"The best thing on the menu is the grilled octopus and rocoto ceviche. The cocktails and beer selection are nothing to write home about. Not a bad vibe but feels pretty lounge/generic. Could be better but could also be worse. Also, very little in the way of vegetarian/vegan options."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/15/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I have been to many vegan restaurants in Miami and I have never been completely satisfied with the food... or the overall experience... until I came to Plant. I am so impressed with this place, that I am writing the review from the table... ,Honestly, the menu did not sound appealing to me, but still decided to give it a shot, and I am very glad I did. While the food was not ""out of this world"", it was VERY VERY good... and the ambiance and the service made it an overall experience of 10/10... ,Definitely recommend it... at first I though I shouldn't believe the 17 - 5 star reviews... but again... here I am... gladly leaving the #18..."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/12/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Fantastic, life altering, eye opening EXPERIENCE of a restaurant. You do NOT have to be Vegan to thoroughly ENJOY dining here. The passion fruit flan is REMARKABLE and we didn't recognize it was plant based until half way through and were truly mind blown because flan is literally made from milk!!!! The cauliflower is delicious, the mushroom ""ropa vieja"" WOW. My least favorite part, if I'm honest, is the watermelon drink. It tastes really fresh and refreshing, but WAY too sweet! So if you're not into sweet sweet drinks, try their mojito..... it's the bomb lol they offered us a tour after dining and it was incredible!!!!!! Check out the photos of this kitchenless eatery:"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/14/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,A completely off the hook Vegan Mecca Of place. The amazing food is worth walking from Alaska to eat. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/18/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"We are not vegans or vegetarians.  But we love Mobi's restaurant Little Pine in Los Angeles and decided to try this vegan hot spot in Miami.  Yum on all we had but the cheese board.  Not disappointed otherwise.  We had harvest dumplings, beet tostada, funghi noodles and banana leaf tamale.  Our two desserts were the baby apples with chocolate bark and the sweet potato pie.  The apple dessert was a huge omg.  An absolute must.  Smaller menu and more pricey than Little Pine.  Also, a bit less creative.  But for Miami, is great spot.  And unlike Little Pine where food is cooked, this place is raw.  More intimate and zen.  Outdoor seating definitely preferred here.  Zen garden with water and trees.  Very relaxing. An international crowd.  Wine list very good, considering all are organic.  Highly recommend.  Hear that chef owner is in litigation with landlord, so not sure if will be here longer.   But while it is, you should go."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/16/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"The presentation, flavors, and service make this place amazing. We came for a late night bite, and they didn't slack on anything. It was many of our first times having vegan food, and we were impressed with it all. Enjoyed the ambience as well. Would def go back, and I'm not even vegan."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/20/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"If you have not been to Plant Miami, you need to go now!!! OK so why go to a Vegan restaurant if your not Vegan? Ha! This place will convince you, you just might tolerate being Vegan. The food is delicious and the ambiance is spectacular. We visited on a Tuesday night and the stars where out and the view of the lit up buildings through the trees, sitting next  to the fountain  was magical. We had the castelvetrano olives to start which were delicious and the Beet Tostadas. For dinner we had the celery root lazagna. I don't like celery and I left nothing on my plate! We topped it off with the sweet potatoes pie and we were fighting for the spoon. All in all it was a great experience."

Please open a location in Boston!!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/17/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"A delectable vegan dining experience adjacent to The Sacred Space. Menu has just changed for the season and everything we ordered was amazing. Such beautiful presentation and attention to detail on each dish, unique and creative selections, and the taste was five star. Everything is made fresh on site"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/10/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Amazing experience from start to finish. Food is delicious - coming from a non-vegan, foodie. ,Order:,Blue cheese olives ,Tomato tartlet with pimento cheese ,Cacio di Funghi ,Key Lime Brûlée ,Staff is killer. ,Great cocktails. ,In the clutter of Miami restaurants with subpar service and cuisine, Plant is a shining star. ,Can't wait to be back in MIA and try more on the menu. ,Cheers!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/17/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Great food in an excellent setting that both vegans and non vegans can enjoy. I started with the dumpling and the tamale (brunch menu). Both dishes were very good although very small portions. We then had the funghi and the kofte. The funghi was amazing and full of flavor which isn't easy to pull off with a raw cold dish. The kofte was also very good but outshined by the funghi. We then finished off with the papaya cheesecake , which was good, but not excellent and extremely overpriced for the portion. All in all, the food was great."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",9/1/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Fantastic! Whether you are vegan or not, it doesn't matter, the food is delicious, there is a wide variety of flavors and you will leave full. The location is spectacular and very zen. I recommend a once try for sure!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/29/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I am not a vegan nor do I have those aspirations.  However, I have an open mind and when my daughter-in-law recommended Plant Miami in The Sacred Space, it was no problem.  ,In the middle of a rough looking part of Miami is this Oasis where you feel the calm from the parking lot.  The huge, rusted iron gates with the lotus flower emblem welcomes you to what your mind perceives will be amazing.  You will first see the pool, a garden, lounge area and the restaurant.  The staff is perfect for your dining experience, they are happy and knowledgeable, appear when you need them and then disappear.   ,My family and I were looking around at the food coming to the other tables around us and joked that we will go have dinner after this dinner....why? The portions looked small....no tiny!  Tiny food.  My daughter-in-law and I had the Moroccan bowl, one son had the Banana Leaf Tamale and the other son had  the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja.  I tasted all of them.  All were perfectly spiced and so delicious.  My favorite might have been the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja, and the Banana Leaf Tamale is a close second.  I have to talk about the cheese platter we had to start.  The cheeses were more of a pate texture (was a surprise to me, the non vegan) so good and delicious, also the compote but the pickles were a bit strong for me.   We all cleaned our plates and was surprisingly FULL!  WE still had the tiny dessert key lime brulee with the vanilla ice cream because.......we just had too!  Whoo!  They did not disappoint.  Oh my son said the 'Old Fashioned' he ordered was the best he ever had.,Now for the long drive back to Boca Raton, and I thought for sure I will need a little sumtin sumtin to eat when I got home....guess what, I was still satisfied and relishing in what I had just experienced.  This is absolutely the best vegan gastronomic experience I have ever had. Go and enjoy."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/12/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,Amazing Raw Vegan Choices.  Everything is very tasty.  Wine choices are pretty ample and the drinks are also very good.  The lasagna was amazing we had the dumplings and chocolate desert was yummy.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Absolutely hands down a great place. The whole menu is vegan or plant-based and gluten free. From the freshness and great selection of their ingredients to the elegant yet chic presentation of their dishes and drinks this place sets the atmosphere for everyone to relish great healthy dining in a sacred hidden Miami Paradise-like location. Dishes like the harvest dumplings, beet tostada or the handmade cheese board will have your taste buds asking for more . Not to mention their great succulent fusion of flavors covering a wide variety of international dishes like tamales, cacio de funghi, celery root lasagna, sprouted almond falafel or the asian Bowl just to mention a few. ,This is a must try new experience for all vegan and non-vegans to see what is like to dine in a place that doesn't use any animal products in their recipes and serves in decent moderate portions defying the American conception of huge or supersize portions where one stuffs oneself beyond our limits"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/22/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,I'm a carnivore but my best friend is vegan and we had dinner here. Food was surprisingly amazing. I had the banana leaf tamale and it tasted like meat tamale. It was delicious and to know that there wasn't any meat was amazing.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/31/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"If you are a vegan and you enjoy experimenting with gourmet cuisine, go to Plant Miami. The ambiance is beyond exquisite, the service is perfect and the food is delicious.  It is on the expensive side however, it is worth it."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/13/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I was only in Miami for two and a half days and I came to Plant twice. The restaurant is beautiful and secluded making it feel like you are on a Zen retreat. Every single thing that came out was out if this world, order the cheese board and you won't be disappointed. The sweet potato cheesecake was one of the best desserts I've had and it was raw vegan. I think the menu is priced fairly for food that is so obviously cooked with love and exquisite attention to detail. The servers make you feel relaxed and the food comes out at a perfect pace."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/14/2018,$$$,3,Plant Miami,"The ownership changed but the head chef stayed. I love raw vegan food and loved a few specific dishes at this place. Unfortunately they changed the recipes and missed! The grounds are as beautiful as ever, the service very good and the servers knowledgeable about every dish. I hope they get it right soon as we don't have many choices for this sort of food around here. We stopped for lunch. Definitely too expensive for veggie dishes, over priced for sure!!! We had 3 dishes (small quantity) shared by 2 of us and the bill was nearly $100 without any drinks. Either you don't go hungry or you go ready to spend a lot of money to fill satisfied."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,AMAZING -- cannot say it enough that you need to go here today! Best vegan meal that will enter your mouth. You're palette will be screaming - YAS!
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/2/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This place was very unique with a great outdoor setting. Everything on the menu I tried was tasty. Must try if vegan, I'm vegetarian and this was very interesting for me, but everything was great."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/30/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Literally every little detail. Wonderful atmosphere. Excellent food, beautiful presentation. From the simple elegance of table decor; an air plant in a clear glass vase, to the water jug with big cork plug, the simple elegance is palpable. I had the sweet potato dumpling, Asian Bowl and the sous vide lady apple desert. I wanted to take the desert for carry out but they wouldn't serve it carry out; as not to compromise the dish or presentation. I appreciated that! I decided to order it any way.  I left stuffed. I don't normally eat that much out, but I didn't want to leave and NOT experience something from every course. My americano coffee was served with hot cashew milk; a really nice touch- and coconut sugar. I don't normally take sugar in my coffee, but I wanted to experience the  combo of cashew milk and coconut sugar. Excellent coffee. The outdoor dining beside a Grove of trees was really lovely- one tree, beautifully lit, looked like a goddess! When you eat there, look for it!  The interior seating and bar area was contemporary and hip. Can't wait to come back and enjoy another fabulous experience- this time with others who love Raw, and fresh and vegan. I was there on my own, but really wished others could experience it with me too! Next time! Thank you!"

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/25/2018,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"The bf loves to take me here on date night.  He is an omnivore, but still very much enjoys eating here.  It is very romantic and the food is delicious.  I love that they keep things raw, as I have not seen any other raw vegan fine dining establishments in Miami.  The aged nut cheeses are heavenly, as I have not tasted bleu cheese in years and this is as close as it gets.  I love a vegan restaurant that will create their own cheese, rather than throwing some Daiya on everything.  The attention to detail in each dish is awesome.,That all being said, their are a few negatives..  The parking situation is tricky if you do not want to pay for valet.  I wish the parking lot next door was just open for free parking.  The service is average.  The servers are certainly knowledgeable, but not especially attentive.  I have sat with an empty wine glass or water glass and not been asked to refill, when I would gladly order another (missed opportunity).  I also, like many other reviewers, wish the prices were slightly lower.  I understand that every dish is of great quality (not quantity), but I would like to dine here more often (certainly would if I had a higher ""dining-out budget"").,Tip:  Dining here during Miami Spice gives you a nice prix fixe option at a good price."

Outdoor indoor seating with amazing palm trees. Very ""miamish"" you just have to visit to understand  what I mean. ,My friend is vegan and I gave him the liberty to order for me. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I know it contained ,Portobello mushrooms. Every thing was perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing. ,Weather you are visiting or live in Miami PLANT is a must,There is valet parking and also self park. ,Be advised that sometimes the have events and might be closed to the public make sure you call ahead and find out."

Located in the sacred garden venue, plant offers gourmet raw vegan cuisine.,Started off with the beets dish, very good but wouldn't recommend it to people who never had raw or vegan food. ,For my main dish I had the pasta and it was amazing. This dish could easily be served at a gourmet non vegan restaurant. ,Dessert was a sweet potatoe pie. Had better. ,Overall great food and real refreshing to see a vegan place with this quality of food. Will definitely be back!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",10/25/2017,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"Fabulous atmosphere hidden behind a gold wall. Not so easy to find. Great vegan dishes. We had a Ceasar salad, that our carnivore friend said was better than a a non vegan. It was large and cheesy with very interesting seasoning.  The avocado smash was also great with chunky chips.  My husband had a fantastic banana tamale which was warm and delicious. Our friend had a cold veggie lasagne which he devoured. ,I had the coconut ceviche tacos which I honestly was too full to eat. The were served in collard greens, which is my favorite. They were actually a little too lemony for my taste but that's kind of the ceviche flavor. ,The service was excellent as was the outdoor seats no area.  Vegans must give this place a try. Street parking by app or valet."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/12/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Wow, fantastic plant-based dishes! The taste of these dishes far exceed the vegan restaurant by my place in Maryland and I'm jealous.,Do expect to spend some money. This is an upscale place and portions are a bit small too. I had the Moroccan Bowl and while it seemed larger than some of the other dishes, it was so delicious that I really could have used another few bites! ,The other refreshing thing about this place is many of their dishes are whole/raw foods rather than full of dishes that really stretch to copy their animal-based originals. Many times, those types of recipes--in my opinion--are a flop because they try to be something they're not and they end up tasting funny.,To move on to the drinks, while you're here, order one or two! Even the nonalcoholic ones are amazing. You're already splurging by eating here, so why not have the full experience? The next time I'm in Miami, I will make a point to visit this calming, beautiful, and delicious establishment again."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/21/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This was an experience....an amazing one! The food was to die for and so elegantly displayed, a true form of art! from beginning to end the service was impeccable. I loved the Harvest Dumplings and the Cacio Di Funghi. Can't wait to return to try some of the other items they have. The seasonal and local fresh ingredients are so delicious and in most cases you can't even tell that it is a vegan restaurant. I reeeally do recommend the dishes I mentioned above, a must try for sure! Just an FYI, I am not a Vegan, and I loved this place!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Stunning restaurant! Amazing experience for brunch - we sat outside in a beautifully designed courtyard, listening to mellow Thievery Corporation, and ordered a couple of dishes and cocktails. The service was impeccable, very knowledgeable, insightful, and helpful without being pushy. The food was sooooo beautifully plated, it tasted divine, and even though it was vegan/raw, my husband (who loves meat and tends to shun anything vegetarian) and I felt very satisfied after eating.,The only negative were the shaved truffles - they were rather bland and tasteless. I'm a huge truffle fan, and these were kind of stale. ,Still I highly recommend eating here! It's pricey, yes, but it will be a very memorable experience. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!"

I stumbled upon this place during a recent visit to Miami and it's making me want to extend my visit so I can come back again and again!! The food was delicious, light, filling and GORGEOUSLY presented! I didn't even want to eat some of it since it literally looked like art! The wait staff beautifully explains each dish to you as it's brought out and is incredibly attentive the whole time. ,I started with the harvest dumplings to share (sweet potato and kimchi), then got the cacio di fungi and ended with the delicious dessert special: a coconut flan! My mother got the celery root lasagna and ended with their chocolate forest special. We picked at each other's meals and it was all phenomenal. It's all RAW, healthy, tasty. ,Most vegan restaurants make up for flavor by frying, over-salting, over-oiling, etc. Not this place!! We got a tour through the kitchen after (an awesome service they provide) and there was no smell or anything bad. They have nothing to hide! Most food is dehydrated or cooked sous vide, or simply raw!,Everyone working is SO sweet and you get the chance to meet the chefs! They showed us some more dishes they were preparing which all looked phenomenal (attached photos of those too!). They also have an extensive drink list from their eco bar. ,Hoping to make it back again before leaving. It's a MUST"

I ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend (non vegan) ordered the burger. Both were delicious and she was surprised at how good the taste was. The fries were crisp and well seasoned and I even ordered from their deli some cheese so I can have some at home. Definitely check it out, especially if you do eat meat. It will shock you."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"What a neat spot with amazing food!!! Vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters alike will walk away satisfied.

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Once a year my entire family turns vegan for my brothers birthday. This is the spot he chose this year. He has frequented this spot. I have to say the services are part of what makes this place so great. We are a party of 12 and they definitely exceed their service expectations all the while being very busy as many people are coming in to pick up to go orders or place to go orders. The person in the front taking the orders (forgot name) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I wouldn't doubt if he is an owner and if he isn't, owners should know they have hired real talent. He took the time to explain the scientific process of how their products are made and was able to answer everyone's questions. He let us know what their specialties are and recommendations. Food was good. Ordered probably one of everything being that we have such a large party LOL. I recommend the mac & cheese, waffle fries, burnt barbecue tips, and burger. If you are a Vegan or just want to try some good vegan comfort food I recommend this spot. For me I have to say what made it so great was definitely the friendly and knowledgeable service. I hope that this will continue as they expand or move to a permanent location. Only reason why I couldn't give it five stars is because there is no bathroom. It appears that most people go for a quick bite or get food to go. It's almost like a food truck that's there permanently. However there is space for them to at least put a porta potty. So if you plan to eat there and don't live in the area make sure you scope out nearby public restrooms beforehand."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,I've made this my go to Friday spot. My son and I have tried several dishes and they all are delicious. We tried the island Mac n cheese. My son loved it. He also had burger - *consensual meat of course*  I had the island patty melt. Last week I got the meatball with waffle fries and we had a float with vegan ice cream. You gotta try this place. The Two guys that operate the food truck are very pleasant and professional. Maybe I'll see you there one Friday  - Enjoy
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Delicious vegan food - just a bit tricky to find. I was visiting family in Miami and knew I wanted to make a trip here. My carnivore father enjoyed the food and service even more than my vegan self! They truly are making vegan food for carnivores here haha. A delicious, hearty meal cooked with love and fat is sure to please anyone!"

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/18/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is amazing! Everyone is always super nice, and the food is soooo Delicious!! It's a little far away from me, so I make sure to order something when I head up north.  It's usually just a 15-20 minute detour, so definitely worth it! I have brought many omnis here, and they all love it, too.  My favorite item is the Kansas City Burnt Tip sandwich.  Tip: if you want it to go, order and pay online.  Whether you're vegan or not, try Atlas, you won't be disappointed.  :)"

To my surprise they opened shop here at the Wynwood Yard. Whether vegan, cheagan, vegetarian or a meat eater you WILL enjoy eating here. I had the BIG Mac'n (it came with some fries), my partner the Kansas City Tips and the chili cheese fries. All 5/5 and pictured for your visual pleasure. ,I know Della Bowls (also in at the Wynwood Yard) is noteworthy and delicious BUT do go visit their new neighbor Atlas. Your taste buds will thank you and so will your animal friends."

Atlas serves up sandwiches that gives some of the nearby traditional sandwich spots a run for their money. ,Food:,Le Bleu ($11) is the more popular sandwich at this vegan spot: grilled portobello, garlic aioli sauce, a 'bleu' cheese & 'steak sauce', finished with caramelized onions. ,#GoVegan"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/2/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I tried atlas with a Groupon. It is a food truck that serves vegan sandwiches that mimic classic meat sandwiches. As a vegan, I was excited to indulge in the fried chicken sandwich. It was pretty good but didn't blow me away. I found it a little bit greasy. My mom ordered the island burger and hers was delicious! I definitely want to go back and try more of their creations."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/15/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This is probably my favorite vegan spot in Miami. The food is just incredible and really well priced. I had their patty melt and tried the burger. Both were phenomenal. They seriously give some of the better beef burgers a run for their money. The service was quick and friendly. It's set in an outdoor picnic table and you get your food and take a seat. Order ahead online, which threw me off first time I came but very easy to navigate. Definitely coming back again and again whenever I'm in the area. Definitely recommend!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/29/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is amazing. It is hard to find filling, comfort vegan food and this place has done it! Super cute atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food! Must try for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/19/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"The food was GREAT, the guys behind the counter were very friendly and the order came out quickly. It's a cute, hidden vegan gem, however, I cannot give it 5 stars because some inconsiderate woman lit up a cigarette after finishing her food right next to other people still eating. Nowhere is there a nonsmoking sign and no one asked her to go elsewhere with her cancer stick. Again, food, service and ambience are great--just wish there were non smoking signs up for people who clearly have no manners."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This is my favorite vegan spot. I am so happy they finally opened a location in Miami. Located off 79th street they are currently serving out of their food truck, which is parked on their future permanent restaurant property, (currently being remodeled and crossing fingers will be ready in September).,For now, you can make yourself comfortable at one of their covered picnic tables and wait for your name to be called. My current favorite is the Island patty which doesn't look as impressive as the others but delivers in flavor. It is a burger patty served on rye with caramelized onions and their delicious island mac sauce. I also like the classic which is a big mac style burger and their fried chicken sandwich is very popular too except i find the ""chicken patty to thick for my taste"". They have added new items as well such as loaded fries and chicken tenders. You can turn any of your sandwiches into a combo with waffle fries and a drink (which you can pick out from one of their coolers). ,This is a laid back atmosphere focused on serving high quality, tasty, vegan comfort food. And I'm obsessed! if you don't believe me, Miami New times voted them best vegan restaurant of 2017! Need I say more?"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Finally got to stop here for lunch today! It's a food truck that's a bit hidden off a side street. We were hesitant on sitting outside in this insane heat, but between the umbrellas and all the fans they had going we were actually quite comfortable. Great customer service followed by yummy vegan comfort food!! We started with the Island Mac and Cheese... I've had many vegan Mac and cheeses and this one was definitely unique and tasty! Then we got the classic burger and the Kansas City burnt tips sandwich, both served on a delicious pretzel bun... Both were really good but the the Kansas City burnt tips was definitely my favorite of the two. They were extremely filling despite what some would think of vegan sandwiches. We left stuffed!! I definitely want to come back to try the chicken sandwich!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Oh, how I love meatless (vegan) places that aren't ""raw"" or just some wilted salads.  This place is AMAZING and I finally got to try it today (they have new, better hours).,The place is quite charming.  A food truck with a little garden area with picnic benches, a big fan, and nice people.,I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  OMG, huge portion for a very reasonable price.  The ""chicken"" was perfectly cooked and was real stick-to-your-ribs food.  It was really more than I could eat (consider sharing).   I also had a side of delicious fries (for like $3 more you can add a drink and fries).  There were a lot of people there today enjoying this meat-free, delicious food that no animals were harmed for.,I have nothing bad at all to say.  The guy taking the orders was very nice, and the chef was also super-nice.  I ordered a couple things left off my sandwich (cheese and some garlic stuff), and he perfectly accommodated that request.  I can't wait to go back and try something different.  All good!  Love Atlas!,p.s.  There's plenty of free street parking across from it, and also several places in front of it."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/1/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Amazing experience. If you have ever thought about being vegan or just want to eat a healthier lifestyle, check out this little place. We had the meatball sub and the burnt tip bbq sandwich. They were both so good and you would never know that it was veggies!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Awesome! Finally a Vegan place with really good food!! No trendy over priced tiny portions, the sandwiches are giant and reasonably priced! The ""chicken"" is so fluffy and savory. Fries are a bit over seasoned but def get the garlic aioli to dip them in! Cute backyard spot just wish they were open later. Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/21/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,All I have to say is... O.M.G. This vegan comfort food was so freaking great! They make everything from scratch including their dipping sauces and cheeses. Definitely should check em out if you're in Miami!
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/21/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Yum, yum, & yum!!!!!!! Took a few non-veg humans out here and they just adored it :) As a vegan, this is now easily one of my favorite spots! We got some great recommendations from the host and they were perfect. Yay for genuinely delicious vegan fake meats!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/31/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Amazing vegan food! I've been here a few times and would highly recommend the loaded fries and the fried chicken sandwich. Yumm. I also love that they always have deals going on Yelp and Groupon. The only downside I noticed during my last visit was that there was a significant amount of fruit flies swarming us which made it hard to sit and enjoy the food. It had just rained earlier in the day so that could be the reason but it's definitely an easy fix for them so don't let it deter you from coming here.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My favvvv place in Miami ever!!!! Annnnnd my non vegan friends enjoy it too which is deff a plus. My favorite is the buttamilk chickn sandwich with loaded fries... their garlic aoli is super bomb so i don't mind paying the extra fee. Super reasonable prices. Thank youuuuu for providing the best food in town
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/30/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I usually have their vegan comfort food at the Yellow Green Market in Hollywood, but today I worked half day, and decided to stop by  their Miami location. Well, food truck that is...,They have limited hours (11-3pm, tue-fr), so to finally been able to catch them open, was a hit.,Geezzz... Miami heat it's unforgivable... I was planning to eat right there, but the 96 degrees were brutal. They have 2 large picnic tables, where patrons sit family style. One tiny fan didn't do it for me. They are serving from their food truck until September 2017, when their brick&mortar place will be ready next door.,They got busy very fast and suddenly we were like five people  waiting for our orders... ,So, I got their classic single patty burger with fries and a bottle of water for $13. ,Vegan burger was super delicious, super moist, filled with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  However,  next time I'll get the double patty. I wanted more, like a vegan vampire. ,I always want more!!!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is the perfect spot for vegans who still love American classics! Everything on the menu is vegan, but closely resembles your favorite dishes (the loaded fried, classic burgers, Mac and cheese, and soda floats are our favorite!) ,Even though the location is a bit tricky for find, it is worth the search. Free street parking is located right outside of the eatery (which is rare in Miami). The outside eating area is great for sunny warm days, and the truck also offers daily happy hours deals from 1-3pm. On weekends and during lunch time I suggest ordering food to-go on their website or calling it in, to avoid long wait times. , ,Prices are a bit expensive ($15-$20 a person), but for miami that is expected, and for quality vegan food I'm willing to pay up.  South Florida is in need of some tasty vegan food and Atlas delivers!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Very flavorful classics but substituting the meat for meatless. I had the meatball sub and it was exceptional! Really great and I did not miss the meat at all. The meatless meatballs were amazing! This isn't your typical vegan place as many will think. They have bread, fries, sodas, so it's not one of those ultra-healthy places. Definitely a place I will come back to. Right now they are a food truck but soon to open a brick and mortar. I can't wait!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/27/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Wow, this humble looking spot is absolutely amazing! I would give more stars if I could. I went to Atlas meat-free deli yesterday because one of my best friends was visiting and she is a vegan, my boyfriend and I are not but all three of us loved our lunch. Everything is delicious, fairly priced and our food didn't take long at all. I would suggest the loaded fries! The ""meat"" on them has great flavor and texture, and their ""Mac sauce"" is super tasty as well. We also got the patty melt which I loved and the classic burger which has a nice ""meaty"" texture to it. My friend got the Mac and cheese, it tasted clean and creamy. She also got the hot wings, which are very spicy so be aware. I can't wait to go back and try their other enticing menu items. If you're looking for vegan comfort food this is your spot! Adorable food truck set up with charming ambience and tables. This is a must try!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"OMGosh! So delicious. My boyfriend and I had a Groupon and decided to try it and I am so glad we did. We tried the Buttermilk fried chic'n sandwich with coleslaw, vegan cheese, pickles in a pretzel bun. Amazinggggg. We also ordered the Island mac and cheese, it was creamy goodness with a very unique but perfectly executed twist on your traditional mac and cheese. Atmosphere is really quaint and surprisingly private. Overall it was fantastic. Will be back soon!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/18/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is a literal diamond in the rough! Don't let the area deter you from trying out some of the best vegan food you'll ever find. The guys at Atlas do a phenomenal job at preparing some of the best deli style dishes that keep me coming back for more. From their Deli sub to their loaded fries, everything in their menu is delicious. This place closes a little early, and sometimes certain dishes sell out, so Postmates comes in the clutch sometimes. One of the other cool things about Atlas is that you can purchase their vegan ""meats and cheeses"" by the pound, amazing! Try out the vegan cheese and enjoy the nice seating area to soak in some Miami sun. One of my favorite places in Miami!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"We found this hidden gem while running errands in the area, and all I can say is wow! While health is very important to us, finding a balance between food that's good for you without compromising taste has been tough. My ex carnivore boyfriend has had trouble fully transitioning to vegan because he still craves meat! Atlas has the perfect solutions for him, a vegan place with a full bbq menu! It's nothing fancy but it does have a cute little courtyard to enjoy your meal at! This place was a great idea and I highly recommended it to anyone who is trying to make the transition away from meat!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is an amazing example that vegan food isn't boring! They kill it with their entire menu, but my favorites are the fried chicken sandwich, loaded fries & deli style sub sandwich. My partner loves the burnt tips!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/29/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My kids are extremely picky and they love Atlas chickn tenders and classic burger. You can't go wrong with the Kansas City Burt Tip and the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n. They are vegan comfort food at its best!
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Really friendly staff, the sweetest staff I have met. I was recommended the vegan fried chicken sandwich and it was incredible. The sauce on the chicken was the perfect tangy counterpart. The sandwich was so hefty and filling. Their french fries were also so flavorful. It was the best vegan comfort food that I had have in a while."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/22/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I've been here a few times and they have the most delicious vegan food I've ever had. Their ""chicken"" sandwhich is my go-to, and I will never get tired of it. Their mac-and-cheese is spectacular and their loaded fries are also amazing. Thr wait is usually a bit long, but if you order ahead of time, you can save yourself the wait. The food is completely worth the wait though!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/1/2017,$,3,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This was the next stop on my vegetarian/vegan chronicles. I was a little more pumped for this place because the pictures sold it as classic comfort or junk food. ,Ordered with our eyes, per usual.,Got the chickan wings- and I have to say, it was cute. Wrapped the doughy concoction on an ice cream stick to resemble wings. Taste did not match appearance. It was like bread slathered in buffalo sauce. Spicy bread on a stick. They were out of ranch sauce too, that is like a problem. Spicy anything needs a cooling agent.,Got the island patty because they were out of the meatball sub.,I am not typically a fan of rye bread so maybe my bias was on high- but I didn't love this sandwich. The caramelizad onions were good but the sauce is just not great for me. I didn't hate this, I would maybe try again on regular bread. Not sure.,We also ordered the loaded fries. Obviously this was my favorite thing. How do you go wrong with potatoes? Waffle cut style was great. I didn't love the sour cream or cheeze sauce they covered it in but whatever they use for the pastrami burnt ends that was pretty good. ,I don't love that water bottles here are small and over priced.,Maybe if my vegan friend demands we go again I'll try a second time so long as I can order the meatballs and give those a go."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Delicious all vegan food. The island Patty and the loaded fries were a perfect remedy for my hangover
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/8/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"If you like good comfort food, go here. If you are vegan, go here. If you are not vegan, still go here. If you want an idea of how good the food is here, we went while around the area in the pouring rain and there were STILL people waiting, soaking wet, for their food. The cashier guy taking our orders (bless him) had a smile on his face the entire time and greeted us warmly, despite being soaked and probably near hypothermic. I do not recommend coming here with a large party or on a really hot/rainy day seeing as this is a food truck with a small outdoor sitting area. We ordered the sausage and peppers sub and chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese not really knowing what to expect and I couldn't be more glad for that! I had zero expectations and was so pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious and so close to the real thing. The mac and cheese was a little demurely seasoned and could have used some more salt but overall we were happy with our orders. Atlas is representing vegan food the way it should be represented!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Come here hungry and leave satisfied. Their burgers and sandwiches are everything. I've had a lot of good vegan sandwiches in my life and I'm going to say that for now, the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n has to be my fav.  The loaded fries were on point too and I appreciate the seasoning. ,The food did not arrive as fast as I am used to, but it was well worth the little wait. There is enough shade to block out the sun, and it feels very intimate and cozy, almost like I was in the back of a family cookout or something, but everyone there were strangers of course. It was just the vibe."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/7/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Stopped by Atlas with a friend to grab some hearty vegan food before hitting the beach. I'm glad I wasn't in too much of a rush, because, as a food truck, Atlas is small and gets busy fast--my friend and I waited almost an hour for our food. Normally I would knock a star off for such a long wait, but it was evident that there were a lot of orders and not a lot of time so 5 stars it is!,Since I wasn't planning on getting in the water or wearing a bathing suit, I wasn't afraid of having a food baby and decided to go big and order the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (at the suggestion of the cashier as well). It was the best decision EVER. ,First of all, the sandwich was the perfect size and so incredibly filling. For $9, I was thoroughly satisfied. I was absolutely stuffed at the end of this meal. The breaded and fried ""chicken"" cutlet was hearty and, although I usually don't care for fried foods, delicious. The slaw and rest of the sandwich toppings complemented it perfectly and gave the sandwich a fantastic range of flavors and textures. ,Overall, going to Atlas was an awesome choice, and I will definitely be back again. Would recommend!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/25/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I can take my non vegan friends here and they find the meals enjoyable: perk #1. Food is decadent to say the least and packed with flavor. They make everything in their kitchen as they have heir own vegan deli: perk #2. Love the waffle fries and the  buttermilk chicken, classic burger, LOADED FRIES, meatball sub and must definitely try the rest of the menu items, so plenty of visits left unless I plan for a Mukbang . Recommendation: go early or order ahead as in my experience they sell out of the popular items pretty quickly. Perk #3: Prices are right. ,Big yay for atmosphere and service with a smile.,Hoping for more locations in the South Miami area."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/20/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"SUPERB!!!! That's all I have to say about Atlas. I was shooketh of how flavorful a lot of the food were since it's vegan. The cheese sauce is so good!! I wish I can just sip it with a straw (jk but that's how good it is). The buttermilk ""chicken"" sandwich almost tastes like a real chicken sandwich. The loaded fries are delicious too. I think my favorite would have to be between the meatball marinara and classic burger! Both were just kicking my tastebuds with all the flavor and tasted almost identical to real meat. The meatball marinara has a strong taste of thyme (I think it's thyme, I don't mind it though). They also had a special sandwich, the Chimichurri Steak Special, and it was good! It was such a hit they're planning to add it to the regular menu. The server who takes the orders is so nice! He came back a couple times to check how we were doing. ,The only thing though is both times I've gone, I go a little late around 3:30-4ish. So by the time I go, a lot of things are sold out. I definitely recommend going earlier! The Mac and cheese ended up being cold. But everything was still delicious. ,Parking is a bit difficult if it gets packed since it's all street parking.,The sauce for the buttermilk tenders was a bit bland. I hope they can made a better sauce to go with it. ,Overall, I think it's great. I would definitely come back. Groupon also offers a deal for $12 on $20 worth of food! Check it out!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/25/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas Meat-Free began in the humble settings of the Yellow Green farmers market, but due to their popularity among the vegan debutantes they eventually branched out into Wynwood and then relocated to 79st. ,It was at the the YG farmers market that I first encountered Atlas Meat-Free, but the couple of times that I came I left unimpressed. Both times I ordered their much coveted marinara meatball hoagie that unfortunately lacked in any depth in flavor.,My yelp budette Nathaly L. who's a Liberal vegan activist was shocked that I didn't like the food here. She guaranteed that I would like this place, and that she personally was going take me there for lunch.,Fast forward a few months later, I get a text from Nathaly asking me to meet her at Atlas for lunch and that she was treating. Typically I don't allow Beautiful Latina women to treat me, I personally prefer to devoutly serve them, but I accepted her offer.,Finding this place was kind of annoying because they're located in a food truck hidden behind the building with their business address.,Nathaly asked me what I wanted and I told her I'll have whatever she's having ,Ordered :,2 Island Patty Melts - atlas ground burger with caramelized onions and island mac sauce, grilled pressed on rye ($9),1 Loaded Fries - seasoned waffle fries with garlic aioli and island mac sauce, topped with atlas burnt pastrami tips and jalapeños ($9),We got two free bottled waters with the yelp check-in.,Wow portions are huge, especially the fries, we couldn't even finish them.,Outside of Treelion and Konatas, this is the only other vegetarian/vegan place I know of that serves such generous portions.,The Patty melts were impressive, everything about them was tasty and filling, especially the caramelized onions.,The fries were delicious, almost perfect, this is actually the first time I've been able to eat fries without ketchup.,So my attractive little vegan debutante friend Nathaly L. won this round.,A note to consider: VEGAN does not equal GMO-free, pesticide free, organic or preservative free. I haven't seen anywhere on Atlas-free's website nor menu's stating it's free of any of the above aforementioned. Neither do they mention if their bread is free of HFCS or Potassium bromate(this crap causes hypothyroid).,In reality vegan just means that you're not eating another living beings foot or tail Etc."

I would first say the location of this place is not very good, but they do have a very cute set up. I got a burger and although it looked very presentable there was something in it that tasted a bit sour. I only ate about half of it and had stomach pains the rest of the night. The fries were delicious though ...they also did not have many drink selections. This is a vegan fast food as the food is vegan but not all too healthy."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/31/2018,$$,3,Le Pain Quotidien,They need to work on the availability of the menu items. Being vegan it's hard to make this a go to because they are quite often out of the vegan choices. Also the hours of operation are not early enough for a bakery or late enough for a restaurant....figure yourselves out and adjust your hours accordingly!
"219 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/10/2013,$,5,B & M Market & Rhoti Shop,"Background: I grew up in the Caribbean and love to eat. When I first moved to the urban farm where I live right down the street from B&M, I was looking for an inexpensive take-out spot...with vegan and pescaterian options. My neighbors directed me to B&M and it remains my favorite Caribbean food source in Miami.,Experience: Delicious every time. Inexpensive. Fairly fast. Super friendly folks. Try the veggie plate (ask for extra cabbage and pumpkin). The fish stew is also divine.  ,Bottom Line: B&M is one of Miami's hidden gems."
"1450 NW 87th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",11/17/2013,$$,4,Rice House of Kabob,"I'm a vegan and this place is heaven for vegetarians and vegans alike. Food is solid Persian, great portions, AMAZING sauce and a lot of options from different veggies to falafel to chicken, pork and beef (even fish). Really tasty and fresh, nice clean location. The only complaint was that one time I went there during rush lunch hour and the kitchen was having a delay and they told us the wait would be 45 minutes, so we left. But that was only one time, and come on, those things happen everywhere once, so obviously we just came back another day and enjoyed deliciousness once more. It's quick without being a fast food and healthy (MAJOR PLUS). I would recommend the hummus, grape leaves and falafel but I bet meat eaters would love everything else the same. :)"
"1450 NW 87th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/26/2017,$$,5,Rice House of Kabob,"There's a very limited number of restaurants in the area that have options for vegans. The Rice's Veggies and Falafel wrap are good and the staff are more than happy to make sure there's no feta cheese on anything when I order. Online ordering and takeout options rock, and the food always comes out fast."
"1180 SW 57th Ave, Miami, FL 33144",8/19/2017,$$,5,Sakura Sushi & Bar,"Great service, staff is very kind and helpful. Definitely a repeat customer after my first visit. Great vegetarian/vegan options as well as a cozy environment inside."
"1450 NW 87th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/7/2018,$$,5,Rice House of Kabob,Always amazing service and delicious food. Come in 1-2 times a week and have vegan options!
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",12/1/2017,$$,5,Le Pain Quotidien,"SO HAPPY this is here!! I've been a NYC fan for a decade, and having it here is just a blessing from the french-cafe lords. They have vegan coconut yogurt which makes my dietitian heart sing, and an array of other plant-based options (the lentil soup was divine - love the little tiny French lentil variety) and combined with the zucchini noodle pad thai was a sumptuous lunch. I've also had the cheese plate, and again, as a dietitian, that makes me one happy chick - since I studied abroad in France and had this every day for lunch (plenty of protein and relax - cheese is good for you). The service is divine and friendly and the price is perfect. I'M SO IN LOVE."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/12/2018,$$,5,Le Pain Quotidien,One of my favorite places in all of Miami to eat!!! Great vegan and non vegan choices. I chose vegan myself. Love it!!!
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",5/27/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Vegan pizza, DELISH. and the bruschetta classica, amazing as well. Everything tastes so fresh. The vibe of the restaurant is also very nice, we had some beers in the outdoor area and the music ranged from: Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin."
"2 Aragon Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/13/2018,$$$,5,Bocas House Coral Gables,"Excellent food and excellent service!! Marco, our server, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire dinner service. He was able to recommend drink specials which were all delicious. And he was also able to help recommend vegan food choices on the menu. I ordered the quinoa dish with tostones. Highly recommend if in the area and looking for Peruvian and Venezuelan food. Great atmosphere!!"
"2 Aragon Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/11/2017,$$$,5,Bocas House Coral Gables,"I order the lomo Saltado and a pisco martini. It was very delicious. The amount of food is a lot and worth the price. I'm very picky with drinks but this pisco martini was made right. My friend is vegan and I was happy to see that the menu has gluten free and vegan options. So she was able to order some vegan noodles which she was happy with and ate all of her food. We had a side order of tostones, you can't go wrong with tostones. Our waiter was a great guy very attentive, helpful, and kind. His name tag said ""handsome"". My experience here was awesome and I will be returning. Thank you"
"3620 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/22/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,Very flavorful.  Excellent service.  I especially loved the ghost pepper cheddar naan and morels in yogurt sauce. The tandoori short ribs were lean savory with a nice spiciness. Lots of vegan options and enough meat poultry and fish to have something for everyone.
"3620 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,Love the original and this new location. Fantastic places both. Just go eat there and you'll be happy. Ghee thanks so much for offering vegan options!!!! Would be fantastic if you could note which of your vegetarian options could be prepared vegan with a little modification. Or just offer more vegan options!!! Thank you!
"1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",12/12/2017,$$,5,Piola,The thin crust is amazing!!!  If you get a chance to go before 5 your pizza is only $6.  Ask for Pablo!  He's the best!  I am a vegan and they made me the best cheeseless veggie pizza ever
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,5,OTL,"This is a fabulous coffee tea and food spot in the design district. Delish matcha iced tea, always made perfectly. Vegan samosas with unexpected and super tasty fillings. And bigger dishes and desserts, all amazing. Gorgeous setting--airy and fun. Great staff. Go and enjoy!!!!"
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/4/2018,$$,5,OTL,"Amazing little cafe in Design District. The atmosphere is upbeat and trendy with seats inside and out! The lattes and pastries are delicious! The banana quinoa muffin is my favorite and a must try. They have many vegan and vegetarian options as well. The food is a bit pricey, but you are getting quality in all the dishes!"
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2017,$$,5,OTL,"First, the food. I came here for lunch hoping to have a light and healthy meal to keep my day going.  I ordered an Avocado Toast (Vegan) and a Banana Quinoa muffin. It was delicious, you can taste that the avocado was freshly made this morning and the muffin was freshly baked as well. ,Second, the location and decor is simplistic yet very well suited for the area. Located right in the heart of the design destrict next to stores such as LV and Prada. Meter parking can be a little difficult during peak times but there is a garage down the street if you can't find parking. ,Third, service and staff were great. Lots of smiles and prompt responses to my requests. I felt like I was talking with a friend when interacting with them. Even during a rush hour, staff was attentive to the needs of their customers. The manager also come by with a smile to make sure my experience was going well. ,In conclusion, I can't find many problems with this cafe. You can go from a casual lunch, to a business meeting, to study time or a romantic dinner date. The place fits most situations very well and I will be recommending it to others."
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/11/2018,$$,5,OTL,"OTL is in the heart of the design district in Miami, and is such a great place to grab a bite and read your favorite book. The atmosphere is absolutely precious, and the food is just as great! I went with my best friend, she had the Manchego & Pear Sandwich (all of their breads are provided by Zak the baker. Yum!) with matcha lemonade (Delicious. Not too sweet. It was perfect), and I had their Avocado toast, Genmaicha, and a Vegan Chai cookie. ,My avocado toast was perfect. It was a bit hot from the Chili flakes, but overall delicious. The radishes really add a nice bite to the toast. If you're wondering what Genmaicha is, it's a green tea with toasted rice. It may sound weird, but try it! It's a must have if you're into tea. ,Now for the star of the menu, the Vegan Chai cookie. I'm not sure how it's vegan, because it taste better than most non- vegan cookies. It's spicy, salty, and sweet at the same time. So delicious! It reminded me a lot of a snickerdoodle cookie. I highly recommend it."
"901 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",8/30/2015,$$,3,Balans Restaurant & Bar - Brickell,"411 on Mushroom Tofu Burger - delish, but for u vegans out there, u may be sorely disappointed (or pissed off) that there is HAM in the kale and sweet potato side! Two huge thumbs down  for a crappy combo of a vegan burger and a meat-infused side. We like Balans and will return, but please fix this discrepancy."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",1/18/2015,$$,3,Ironside Kitchen,"This establishment is such a diamond in the rough in a transition neighborhood that I was excited to explore this place before going to see a movie at nearby O Cinema Miami Shores.  The outside patio and table lay out is casual, rustic, inviting and artistic (5 stars); the friendliness of the manager is genuine, sincere and delightfully Italian (5 stars); the service - is a work in progress - inconsistent and sporadic (3 stars), but in the end a pizza place must be judged by its pizza.  While the flavors were fresh, and the thinness gave it a crispy crunch, taking the first bite gave me a sense of below average amazement.  I kept taking bites to figure out what was missing and while I thought it was a general under seasoning of garlic, upon further taste bud analysis - the sauce became the culprit. It was missing its zest, it's tomatoey base from which to build upon a potential mouth watering experience (2.5 stars).   Now I applaud the gluten free and vegan options available, but in the end it may be that here they serve Roman style flatbread and I'm used to American NY style pizza.  When the next craving comes, where will you pizza it up?"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",11/22/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Doesn't get better than this. It began with the manager Matteo actually coming out of the restaurant and onto the street to help us find a parking spot. Then came the most amazing food. We are vegan and gluten free and can never find great places to eat. The gluten free crust wasn't your typical bland soggy yuck... It is homemade with special flour from Italy. Best crust we've ever had! Matteo served us wine (free because as he explained he was sorry it took so long to find a parking space)! The salads were beyond description...the spinach and the arugula ones. Basically one of the better meals us vegans have had in a long time. Can't imagine how fantastic it is for all of the folks who eat it all! Run to Ironside!
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",12/28/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This is my new favorite restaurant. First off all, the atmosphere is great...you feel like you're at a cafe in Europe. You would never know you were in miami. The service was incredible, with the owner checking on us multiple times. They also served a complimentary dessert...Nutella pizza. Did I mention of great the pizza was? Probably the best and most authentic pizza I've ever had in miami. Also...there are lots of vegetarian and vegan options. I am vegan and ordered the vegan pizza and it was delicious. The rest of my party were meat eaters and were equally happy with their dishes. I stumbled upon this restaurant randomly online and I'm so glad I checked it out. I will be back very soon!!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",7/3/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Just came by for the 1st time. Great Experience! Great Service! Great Food! Very fresh, by far my new favorite pizza place in Miami.  My wife also loved the vegan cheese option!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",10/29/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This place is a much-needed addition to the neighborhood! Fresh, authentic pizza tasted amazing, and they even offer vegan cheese and gluten-free crust. I had my pizza with both of these options and it was honestly incredible. The service was great, and the vibes were awesome. Great setup and perfect for a low-key date night... let's keep this place alive and thriving."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",8/11/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This place is delicious! Almost drove right by it. thanks to another yelp review and pictures I knew to look for the faces. I got the gluten free crust with vegan cheese, soo good. The crust was delicious! Also the Nutella pizza for dessert.. Yumm. Cute little place, Very friendly staff. Definitely will be back."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",2/4/2014,$$,4,Ironside Kitchen,"The good: food and service were great, isn't that what really matters?  The atmosphere was nice as well, tucked in a funky block with plenty of nature and nearby vegan dessert place.  Ordered a vegan pita and vegan calzone, bread/crust was really excellent, toppings were very good.,The questionable: place was dead however there are 2 important considerations - the place had only been open a short while so will take a while for word to get out, and  it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday,So there you have it.  A solid place regardless of diet, and exceptionally solid for vegans."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",10/1/2016,$$,3,Ironside Kitchen,"I came here like 2 years ago and the pizza was soupy. I finally came back last night and I actually really enjoyed it. I love that they offer vegan cheese for no additional charge. I had an Italian nona and their pesto pasta reminded me of hers. Three stars because although the food was good it was pricey. Made In Italy has INCREDIBLE pasta and for less. Also, when we first walked in we expressed we wanted to sit on the other side where the pizza oven is but the owner behind the counter insisted so much we sit in the cafe that we felt forced to sit there. Even though he meant it with good intentions it was a bit ""ugh"". Also, their manager a bald guy is boisterous and loud. He walks around nervously trying to handle stuff and accommodate people and yells a lot of ""prego's"" and ""grazi's"" which make the place somehow feel more authentic. Besides that the restaurant is pleasant, clean and I enjoy their cute cafe during the day. I must also ack that I could taste the difference in the food now compared to the last time I was here. I also like that it's located in a more hidden part of the area. You're more than likely a local if you're here."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",3/25/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Really good vegan cheese. Probably one of the best vegan pizza I've ever had.
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",1/24/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Vegan pizza WIN. The chewy crust, the flavorful sauce, the Daiya ""cheese"", the impossibly fresh veggies! Taken together, they made the absence of dairy totally unnoticeable. Who knew vegan pizza could be better than the regular?,Pair this deliciousness with shady palms, comfy couches and the laid-back tenants of Iron Side, and this is a hell of a place for a lunch date.,It's spots like this that make veganism a joy. ,Did I mention House of V cupcakes right next door, for vegan dessert? Happy dance!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",5/29/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Best vegan pizza in Miami!!! Their crust is also amazing!!! I love that they don't, like a lot of other places, charge extra for vegan cheese. The atmosphere is lovely and the people extremely friendly. Can't wait to go back and eat more!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",4/15/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Great place! You can bring your own wine and no charge for it. I even saw people bring their own 24-pack of beer. They have vegan options and price is fair. If you are sitting outside eating and it starts pouring they got you covered, no need to move from your comfortably spot."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",5/10/2016,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"-- Vegan-friendly pizza --,A review for any vegan out there searching for authentic, Italian wood-fire pizza in Miami. This restaurant, located in an unassuming area on the outskirts of Biscayne, is one of the few authentic Italian pizzerias that cater to plant-based, pizza-aficionados.,-- Morelli's advice -- ,I first learned about Ironside through an Italian cafe owner after enquiring about the ""Best Pizza in Miami"". He mentioned Ironside and its pizzero, then, a six-time world champion pizza-maker in Italy, and how he was running the show. Say no more -- I'm there. ,-- Champ nowhere to be found --,Days later, I am there - at Ironside. So I head to Ironside ecstatic to have my own pizza made by the champ himself. Unfortunately for me, by the time I got there, the six-time world champion was nowhere to be found. In fact, he was no longer even working there. My server gave a hint that it was ""politics"" - ""things just didn't work out"". He shied away in giving an any real explanation, but it was understandable. ,-- How's that pizza, you dirty pizza-punk? -- ,In any case, the pies here are authentic and delicious. ,Look, vegan pizza doesn't have to suck. I mean, it won't be too long before plant-based cheese can perfectly replicate your favorite cheese on a molecular level. ,But the crust and thick tomato sauce alone was making me fiend for more. The icing on the cake was the legit EVOO straight from some vineyard in Italy and the homemade peppers and capers in a Mason, glass jar.,Pizza * 10/10,Service * 9/10"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",7/2/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Delicious pizza! Bring your own wine. I am a vegan, and they have plenty of options for vegans."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",3/21/2018,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Great little place that is absolutely PERFECT for dinner parties. Mostly outdoor seating - in a very cute courtyard. BYOB with no corking fee. Delicious pizza, comparable to Anthony's but perhaps better. Wonderful salads and pasta is good. The eggplant appetizer is a favorite of everyone I know. Great service, especially for a dinner party (10 people, lots of orders, and nothing came out wrong). No charge for birthday cake slicing/plating either. Vegetarian options, as well as technically ""vegan"" if you get the salads without the cheese. I was impressed by their salad and antipasti selection - I was under the assumption it was a mostly pizza/pasta place. A true gem in the middle of what seems like nowhere! This is also a pet-friendly place (from what I gathered - 2 people I've seen bring dogs) if you sit outside. Casual atmosphere. Cute for date, family dinner, or parties. They also have an ""unlimited"" menu for parties of 8 or more where you pay $30/pp to order any amount for the table of what is on the prix fixe menu."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",6/2/2018,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Went with my boyfriend with some whiskey! I ordered the gluten free pizza and vegan mozzarella and WOW! The service was great as well. Thank you!
