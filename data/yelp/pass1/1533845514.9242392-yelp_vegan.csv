"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/2/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Everything is fresh and delicious, from the food to the smoothies and smoothie bowls. The owner is very sweet and attentive. The location is cute and nicely decorated. I heard the owner used to have a cupcake shop. I wonder if she'll ever open a vegan bakery now that this business is thriving."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/6/2012,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I went to The Last Carrot for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious! I had the felafel pita sandwhich. The pita bread was very thin, so it's kind of a messy sandwhich and I would recommend that you either ask for a fork or keep it wrapped up as you eat it. The sandwhich comes with a green sauce, I have no idea what's in this sauce but it is so good. The place is your typical hipster kind of vegan hole-in-the-wall place in coconut grove so you cannot expect it to be so pristine. Everything is natural and made right in front of you so if you don't like what you see you can walk right out. I only gave it 4 stars because of the cleanliness, but the fact that they were preparing my lunch right in front of me was a huge plus! Everyone was very nice it took a few minutes for the girl to acknowledge us, but nothing I would complain about, the bar was almost completely full and she was only one of 2 servers/cooks so it's understandable. I would recommend this place if you want to have a quick, healthy lunch with a home-made feel. I didn't try the juices but they looked amazing and I will be going back to try one."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/4/2009,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot isn't much to look at, but from the second I walked in the door I knew that I had made it to a little slice of vegan heaven. Instead of trying to decide between Chinese take out classics like Buddha's Delight and Bean Curd & Eggplant or pizza (no cheese) plus a meager list of toppings from the local pizzeria, I had a full menu to choose from including vegan desserts! It had only been a week since I dined at an ultra vegan-friendly restaurant but it seemed like an eternity and I took my time looking over the menu. Would I try the Spicy Tofu Pita Sandwich? Maybe the Hummus Pita? Homemade Veggieburgers are always a safe choice. Or did I want to go for one of their ginormous (yes that's a word, because I say so!) salads. Maybe some hearty soup and a salad. Then there was the prospect of having a smoothie made from real fruit, not concentrated fruit juice or syrups. As I tried to make my decision I looked down to see a huge vegan cake beckoning me to come closer and a full case of vegan cookies and brownies.

"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/14/2017,$$,4,Ms Cheezious,"Yesterday I had the crab grilled cheese with vegan cheese, so good! They have tons of different flavored sauces and condiments to choose from too. This place is great for lunch."
"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/22/2016,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"We loved the truck. Got stoked when they opened up a restaurant. Now, we rejoice a restaurant has opened up closer to us. Tricky to find, as they tend to leave the door open (source for the only sign). Look for the pin-up lady cartoon and pure golden. I appreciated that they were able to split the bill, at the counter. Same great food. Awesome service. Quick table turn around/venue kept super-clean. And the bathrooms... You vocals love in there. Wait staff truly cares for your best dining experience. We had the buffalo sandwich (had a nice kick) and the chicken and waffles (gravy tastes homemade). They do have a vegan option. Board games and Condiments off to the side. The midnight snack, a shake with whip cream, chocolate sprinkles, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered Ruffle chip, and caramel corn, was heaven. No doubt, we will be back!"
"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/7/2017,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"HOW can you not give this place 5 stars!? My friends and I had such a great experience. We went for lunch right at noon and the place wasn't busy yet. We got a chance to take in the menu and put in our orders! I went with the crab with avocado and vegan cheese which was SO GOOD! Wow, I mean you can't really mess up a grilled cheese but this spot gives you all the options to make it the best. They have so many different sauces and even offer tomato soup!,My friends got the short rib and other savory meat grilled cheeses which they GUSHED over. Also the mac n cheese was so decadent and rich - definitely one to share! The oreo milk shake was also extremely tasty. Just in awe after lunch here!!"
"11361 NW 12th St, Miami, FL 33172",4/1/2016,$$,5,P.F. Chang’s,"This is the best chain restaurant for a vegan to go! They are so accommodating and have many vegan options compared to other ones. I had the vegetarian lettuce wraps and the ma po tofu and they were so good that my omni family kept eating it!! Everyone loved it even grandma who didn't even know what tofu was. The service is very good every time we go, they are always nice and attentive of our needs and we never have to ask for things like refills. Definitely my favorite pf changs location in Miami. And I've been to pretty much all of them. The staff is also consistent, I've been waited on by the same girl for over two years now and she always recognizes us and asks about anyone who may not have gone to the restaurant that specific day. Hoping to go back soon so I can try the Buddhas feast because I've been scared to try it but not for long. The only thing I would ask for is a vegan dessert because it's kinda horrible watching everyone eating desserts and not being able to have one yourself."
"11361 NW 12th St, Miami, FL 33172",2/9/2018,$$,4,P.F. Chang’s,"I've always been a sucker for mall chain restaurants... There are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans here. The veggie spring rolls come with chili plum sauce, you can get 2 or 4. There's edamame, salads, and side noodles. There's a vegetarian entree section- I like Buddha's feast (broccoli, carrot, peas, asparagus, mushrooms, tofu with brown sauce) with brown rice. Ask your server about what's in each sauce to be sure. The fried rice he egg in it- you can order without. They also have a nice wine selection. The bathroom was not very clean."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/27/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"I randomly (and happily) stumbled upon Ten Fruits last week on a walk to Bayfront Park. The decor is clean, white, and minimal with facts about healthy foods written all over the walls in a cool newspaper style.  All juices are made from fresh fruits and vegetables with a slow pressed juicer; I learned that this is to retain all of the nutrients that are otherwise lost from the heat and friction of a fast juicer. Juices come in large portions (16 oz) and are bottled with a lid. Ten Fruits also offer salads, Acai power bowls, empanadas, waffles, and quiches, many of which are vegan-friendly. I'm super excited to have found a healthy and delicious place to get my daily serving of fruits and vegetables within walking distance of where I live. I will most definitely be becoming a regular here.,I also hear that Ten Fruits is opening a location in Coral Gables soon!"
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"So I was at Ten Fruits, dropping a deuce in the men's bathroom, when I noticed that the wallpaper surrounding me were these Wikipedia pages of some the most underrated antioxidants known to man (You know, because Yuppies jusy need to be educated). Anyway, I knew about Acai, I just didn't really how to say it -- now I do. With that said, I was very impressed by my Acai bowl, it was even designed like something out of one of those glossy, colorful Vegan recipe books.,But Ten Fruits is cute; something that Miami is looking to transition into, I think. It's always difficult when you're that one organic/health food place surrounded by a bunch of Cuban sandwiches. This place was legit, though, in all honesty."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/9/2014,$$,4,Ten Fruits,"In a nutshell: it's free wi-fi, vegan/vegetarian-friendly, great place for clean eating in the downtown Miami area.,If you think waffles without copious amounts of butter and syrup is criminal, you were not alone, but the whole wheat waffles here are soft and moist without losing their crisp and are tasty topped with fresh fruits and agave. I had the whole wheat waffle + super smoothie combo, with an almond milk latte.,The guy that saw me looking the menu on his way out must have seen my hangover because he suggested the Green Giant, which I can now say is a certifiable cure! It blends avocado, pineapple, coconut water, vanilla and agave for a tasty drink that hydrates and restores electrolytes.,The coffee was okay, they get their beans from Panther which is a popular gourmet coffee shop in the Wynwood Arts District. Unfortunately the almond milk was over-whipped and actually had it's own texture, which made it really hard to keep drinking. I really think almond milk has too thin of a consistency to be properly whipped, so I probably would have been fine if I had ordered my usual soy latte."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/26/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I like this place, the food is good, they've got a range of vegan and gluten-free options, and the atmosphere is casual, quiet and great for a mellow leisurely lunch. The food is prepared before your eyes in a relatively clean kitchen, free (but limited) parking and cash only (as far as I know). The staff is cordial but the service is glacial whether he place is empty or at peak hours. Don't go for lunch on a week day, you won't get back to work in time even if you ask for takeout. I would recommend ordering by phone and picking up."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/25/2010,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Fresh papaya juice and wheat veggie pita with hummus. Health Nut list to the max. The great Vegetarian and Healthfood Counter in the grove.  The spinach pies are also pretty yummy.  This is not a strictly vegetarian place, they do serve chicken and tuna, but its all fresh (at least that's what the food tastes like).  They make great juices and smoothies with all natural ingredients.  It is expensive for a hole in the wall hippie place - a pita sandwich made of hummus and freshly squeezed juice with a vegan brownie for desert cost about $10.  I wouldn't label this posh though because I'm sure the rent is more expensive than the locally grown and raised ingredients."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/10/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,This hidden gem has the best fresh vegan/organic food a girl could ask for. It's so good that the line is to the door during lunch hour so make sure you order ahead of time. The girls that work the counter are always so nice & hospitable - they never fail to call me by name. I highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it! :)
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/1/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I wish there were more places like this in Miami. The menu is simple but always good. Fresh squeezed juices, home made dressings, plentiful veggies, tasty toppings, and homemade vegan dessert. All you have to do is sit at the bar, and order your food, the staff are very nice btw. But you will wait a little if it's lunch time I suggest coming a little before or after the rush, or ordering beforehand if time is crucial for you. Best fresh food around and at a reasonable price. Really, they can't make it easier."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/9/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"Small place, bar counter service and free parking. No matter what ""sandwich"" you get the sauce will make it great. I had the veggie burger and she had a hummus. Everything is served on a very thin pita. So, if you don't like it messy you may wish to order a pie (think empenada here). We showed up 15 minutes before they closed on Sunday evening so they were out of a few fruits for smoothies and the place could use some attention to being clean (bathroom especially). The motto that rang out was ""at least it is vegan"". I just hope all behind the scenes was cleaner than what met the eye but that is rarely the case. ,Vegan cookie was a treat and great. How often do you get a vegan white chocolate macadamia cookie (or was it vegan). Also, it was nice to have a fresh juice though this close to the mall scene.,In short - It was tasty. I just can't truly trust it."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/11/2015,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Me and my wife love this place! It's a little hole in the wall in the grove, with very friendly service and great food. We usually always get the chicken pita with all the veggies plus avocado & either a smoothie or fresh juice. The best part is getting dessert, they usually have some kind of vegan, organic, gluten-free delicious cake!!!!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/30/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"A local health/vegan favorite.  VERY ""divey"" and ""hole in the wall"" but that's part of the charm.  Limited menu but what they ave is delicious AND GET PLENTY OF SAUCES (you'll know what I mean after you try them both)."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/24/2014,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot is a Coconut Grove staple, cherished by Groveites and non-Groveites alike.  I've been coming here for over 25 years, and, though I moved away, I always make it a point to come here to get lunch at least once during my visits back home.  Everything is fresh and tasty. My favorites are the cream cheese and cucumber pita and the chicken or tuna salad melt served in the spinach pie (not the Greek style ones, more like a triangular shaped pita filled with spinach).  They use the spinach pies that are baked fresh at The Daily Bread (soooo good). I always get the green sauce to have with my sandwiches.  I don't know how they make that stuff, but I could put that on anything and everything I eat!  Additionally, they were making fresh, healthy juices way before juicing was cool, and their grasshopper (pineapple with wheatgrass) is delicious. Their vegan desserts are also very good; I, personally, am a big fan of their brownies. The place is family owned and service is always quick and good."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/7/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,Awesome vegan place!! If you want a quick juice or healthy snack this is the place to go. I got the special of the day the falafel pita which was amazing and the orange and carrot juice. It was quick easy and decliious. The only thing I didnt like is that they only take credit cards!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/20/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"One of the best vegan spots in Miami with a nice range of Juices, Smoothies, Spinach Pies, Salads, and Sandwiches... All the juices are refreshing - my personal favorite is the Orange-Papaya... Though the smoothie selection isn't as big, they incorporate their seasonal fruits... They have tasty sandwiches, salads, and quiches that come with their original sauces which are a must on any dish. My favorite dish is the Tuna Melt, it's name is fitting since the sandwich literally melts in your mouth! The only critique is that they don't accept credit cards and they close pretty early- definitely a place for lunch rather than dinner."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/14/2015,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been going there for over 20 years and it is STILL one of my favorite places. LOVE the chicken salad in a pita with   green vinaigrette, cheese and tomato spinach pie, fresh apple juice and vegan carrot cake!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I really like the Last Carrot's menu. They offer health food that is actually delicious and filling. Although a simple dish, the Baked Tofu Salad is very flavorful, vegan and pretty filling -- specifically, the baked tofu and the salad dressings are what make the salad so flavorful (ask for both dressings so you can decide which one you like better; I like them both). ,I make a meal out of a salad and a spinach pie. I love the spinach pies! The cheese is deliciously melty and I like how it's not a typical spinach pie because they use a healthy whole wheat pita instead of a fatty flaky crust. ,Aside from the food, the service is a little spotty. I've been here and have been completely ignored or unacknowledged for at least 5-10 minutes before someone said hello and took my order. Other times I've waited less than 5 minutes and the staff seemed pretty pleasant. I guess you'll never know what the service will be like here but at least they make up for it with delicious food!,I'll definitely keep coming back here for the reason that the way I feel after a meal is energized, healthy and satisfied. I'd rather go here for lunch than Chipotle and feel completely stuffed and gross after."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/15/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"This spot has been my favorite for years! Good ol' clean and delicious food. It's always satisfying and friendly on your pocket. It's good for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. I'll forever be faithful to this place."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/4/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I've been going to this place for years and the food will always be deeelicious.  My favorite is the spinach pie with tomato and avocado.  And don't forget the vinaigrette!  I'm not sure what's in this green sauce but man it's so flavorful and bright.  I could eat the stuff with a spoon it's so good.  Juices and smoothies are also very yummy, and they make an INCREDIBLE vegan chocolate cake. Definitely recommend!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/10/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"They were super friendly and more than willing to customize my order. Most of the eating area is counter top and definitely was the place to be during lunch hour. Anyone looking for a vegan or vegetarian eatery, this place is absolutely great!! Can't wait to come back again when I'm in Coconut Grove"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/27/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,Natural at its finest!  This place isbrefeeshing whether youre a vegan or just want to keep it light.  Had the grosshopper juice which had fresh pineapple and wheat grass shot.  So good. Iwas in the mood for something sweet so I ordered the peanut butter apple and banana PITA.  My daughter had the chicken salad pita that was stuffed with brussel sprouts and veggies delicious.  Everything was refreshing you feel good after you eat here I will definitely be back also prices are low under $10 per person.
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/5/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,I am a Coconut Grove Native and this is my favorite place to go eat on a regular. The chicken salad pita or the spinach pie with cheese extra crunchy with the tofu they marinate and bake so good. Yum. Then the dressings and the smoothies and the vegan cake..AND the brownies!!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/19/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Just walking into this place makes you feel like you can live to be 100.  The food and juices are so healthy and fresh.  I had the chicken salad with greens and the beet juice with ginger was extremely delicious and satisfying.  There is a little bit of a wait as the place is small and there are about three staff helping people.  The staff takes your order, prepares your meal and then helps the next group waiting.  It's great because you go get your food promptly after you order, but I think that for general customer satisfaction, if you had some interaction and then waited 10 minutes for your order as a customer you wouldn't feel as anxious.  The food is very good and as I said FRESH.  It's a great healthy alternative and has a lot of vegan options."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/15/2018,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been to The Last Carrot a few times and have always really enjoyed the food.  This is a juice and pita/salad place that serves up really good, really healthy stuff.  There is no table service, you have to order at the counter and bring it back to your seat.  I love the baked tofu.  The green sauce here should be bottled and marketed immediately.  Drink selection is somewhat limited and they do offer lots of natural juices and smoothie type drinks.  Great little vegetarian/vegan/healthy spot in the Grove.  It's homey and friendly but a touch on the loud side when the juicer starts up.  What a great spot for a quick bite that your body will thank you for."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2018,$$,3,Ten Fruits,Ten Fruits has a large selection of vegan salads and other fruit and vegetable forward dishes in addition to the array of smoothies and bowls on offer at the restaurant. I bought a corn salad from the fridge section and it was the perfect balance of acid and spiciness without overpowering any of the ingredients. It made me eager to try other dishes from the shop.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/30/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great concept, delicious food and a nice atmosphere! Friendly, helpful service. My husband and I tried the Wellness Smoothie, avocado toast and lentil bowl. As a traveling vegan, this was a rare find. Love the priority on healthy eating, which is unfortunately way too rare these days. Bravo to these awesome folks and their gamble that some people really do want healthy food, and it looks like it's paying off. Delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/23/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Omg this place is amazing Great to have found an organic juice bar that serves vegan food in the area, the place is beautiful and the best part is it's also drive thru when your on the run"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/8/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Thank goodness for a wonderful vegan option in the heart of Kendall. Even non-vegans would be happy to eat here! Everything I have ordered has been amazing. I only wish they were open later and would deliver!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/9/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Honestly, this was the most delicious smoothie bowl I've ever had. I had the dragon bowl and it is hands down gorgeous. It was delicious and all the fruit was perfectly ripe. It may be $8.50 but it was more than enough to share with my boyfriend. He enjoyed it too. It's nice to see a place like this, where a vegan can go and get something without it being a hassle in Miami. I can't wait to try more of their products. And the owner was sweet and adorable! I hope it does well!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is awesome. Juices are fresh and your body will thank you for drinking them. The food is delicious and extremely healthy - tastes like someone made it for you at home. I am not a vegan/vegetarian/health nut by any stretch of the imagination but I look forward to having a chance to stop in.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/14/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan but ran into this place and decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Dragon Bowl & Avocado Toast. The Dragon Bowl was amazing! Filling, refreshing & pretty lol! The avocado toast was good too, just too much avocado for me, but this seems like it should actually be a pro."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/28/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Even though I'm not a vegan, Roots is still one of my favorite lunch/breakfast go-to places in Miami. So if you're holding back on coming because you aren't vegan either, DONT! They're food is super great for everyone and their Fruit bowls and smoothies are the best thing to have on a hot Miami day. My best friend is vegan so it's nice to have a place near the area we can both go to enjoy. Wish they had more places down here like this one!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Super fun and friendly staff + absolutely delicious vegan food. The juices are also fantastic, not too sweet, yet aromatic and flavorful. Perfect!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/16/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have had just about all of their smoothies and they are all amazing! Although I am not vegan, I'm in love with this place. I can only afford to spend 9 bucks on a juice smoothie once every other week, but I have always enjoyed those smoothies up until the last slurp. :)"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/25/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Great vegan spot! Wish they had one closer to Doral. Drove down to try it after hearing good reviews and was not disappointed. Simple and delicious vegan food and fruit smoothies!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The best restaurant in miami. I love the food is very healthy and the smothies are awsome!!! Enjoy the vegan life.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/11/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So happy this place opened up! Finally don't have to drive far for a vegan friendly place! Tried one of their cold pressed juices, it was delicious. Can't wait to try their smoothies and snacks!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/21/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love love love this place! I am not vegan, but I would say this place is a vegans paradise! Every time I get a juice from Roots I instantly feel better, more energized, ready for my day. Their smoothies are sooo good! Crave is my favorite, it tastes like a cinnamon roll. I was never too much of a fan of pressed vegetables into a juice, but then I tried their juices and I never turned back(I've even thought about doing a juice cleanse, but I think I'll wait a while before doing that). Some people may think this place is expensive as all their juices/smoothies are $8 each, but you do get a lot of it. Also, if you're hungry I suggest you try the morning bagel! It honestly blew my mind when I remembered I wasn't eating actual cream cheese, it was full of flavor! Roots has a star reward program where if you get 10 stars you get a free drink! Totally recommend even if you're not into ""vegan"" places!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"love this place! great healthy option in the heart of kendall. this place reminds me of somewhere you'd typically find in coral gables or wynwood, so it's really refreshing to have healthier options closer to this part of town. i love the pb+j smoothie, and they have one of the best acai bowls i've tried. i love the atmosphere, even though it can get a little crowded while waiting for food during a rush. i'd rather pay $10 for a wholesome, vegan smoothie here vs $8 for a smoothie filled w sugar syrup somewhere else. it's priced about the same as any quality health food restaurant... not a ""cheap eats"" place, however quality ingredients cost more and you can tell the difference in the food and how you will feel after!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great staff, great service and most importantly great food! Really enjoy the acai bowl, PB&J smoothie! The zoodles with vegan bolognese was spectacular!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love Roots!! This is my go to place for juices, vegan treats, damn good and filling acai bowls! Everything here is absolutely amazing! It's small but it's cozy for a quick bite to eat with a couple of friends or even just to grab a shake after a good workout! No matter the occasion Roots is the place to be!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not a vegan, I'm not a vegetarian, not even close. But this place is amazing. I crave it. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll crave meat too but I don't feel as good after eating meat the way I do after I eat here. What you're looking at in this picture is the acai bowl and the avocado toast. I've also have had the quinoa bowl, lentil bowl and the dragon bowl. They've never missed the mark."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love having this place right next to school. I have never had anything that I didn't like. Their smoothies are great - Pitaya is my favorite! Their acai bowls are also amazing! I also can't get enough of their squash soup - it's made without cream just the vegetable since it's vegan. I've also had their lentil bowl. Everything is so good and best part, healthy!  Highly recommend for a nice refreshing meal, you won't be disappointed."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So very pleased to have an organic vegan spot in West Kendall. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is peaceful. Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious, never too pricey. I just hope they continue the all organic everything movement. Some places start of organic then start slacking. I really appreciate healthy and organic food that I don't have to cook myself all the time. Keep up the amazing job!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely LOVE this place! My sister showed it to me and I just love the atmosphere they have created, not to mention the staff is super sweet and the food super nutritious and delicious!!! I've eaten the food on multiple occasions and I love everything!! It's simply amazing  if you're vegan or simply want a tasty healthy meals, Roots is the place for you !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOOOOVE this place. Just what kendall needed. The food is healthy and delicious, they have a variety of vegan choices, and the it's clean! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Now everyone seems to be raving over the dragon bowl, which is amazing, but my recommendations are either the fajita bowl or quinoa bowl paired with a pb+j smoothie. However, I have no doubts that anything you order won't be amazing."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm so glad a place like this opened up in Kendall close to where I live. This spot is perfect for a healthy/vegan/organic meal, snack, juice or smoothie. I wish I could eat here everyday! Roots is a small, modern, and very clean juice bar with a variety of options. I tried the fresh pressed juice named Verde I was worried I wouldn't find a juice without ginger (I'm not a fan) but they had several juices without it so I was pretty happy! As far as food, my favorites so far have been the quinoa bowl, acai bowl, dragon bowl, and avocado toast. I highly suggest you try the dragon bowl...so delicious! The owners are fully devoted in pleasing the customers. They are friendly and attentive and will give discounts for advertising their business on social media."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've gone twice this week, Monday being my first time. This place came highly recommended by a few people being that I'm always looking for vegan places and live in Kendall.. Omg. This place is phenomenal. Love the location, the food, the service! Only downfalls are (like all vegan restaurants) it's very pricey (but worth it) and it's very small, not enough seating. But that didn't mean I wasn't going to give this place anything less than 5 stars. I'm so happy it's so close to me, will be going there to often lol."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"What do you mean there's no meat!? I just had the frijole bowl and it was absolute fire. Portions didn't appear to be too challenging however, it fills you up fast. Barely able to withstand another bite, I mustered up the strength finish the last yummy morsel. The kind staff made for pleasant vibes. I may not be a vegan, but I can get used to eating like this especially if I get a free juice/smoothie for my loyalty."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a nice little place to get some healthy vegan meals and fresh raw juices. There isn't much seating, so if you come when it's busy you may choose to take your food with you. The prices are reasonable and the food is all healthy and tasty, the staff seem friendly and the overall vibe is nice. If you want a refreshing juice or a healthy place to eat as a vegan or vegetarian in Kendall this one is it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a rare find for me in Kendall, a cozy juice/smoothie bar with lots of organic and vegan breakfast/lunch/dinner options. I enjoyed the seating options inside and outside. ,I had the kidney bean dish with brown rice, asparagus and avocado/tomato toppings and it was really tasty. Like out of gramma's kitchen. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. ,I also had the crave smoothie, which was a little banana-y for my taste- I kinda wish it had more cacao taste, BUT it was my first time trying and when I go back I plan to try a new smoothie (the hot pink dragon fruit smoothie interested me) and maybe re-order the crave smoothie and ask for them to add more cacao flavor. I forgot to take a pic :( next time. I'll be back for sure."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Absolutely amazing! My favorite is the Quinoa bowl. The food is so fresh and delicious and I'm not even Vegan.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,What a cute little vegan spot. And its conveniently located near my gym. The smoothies are so delicious. I love anything tropical and these smoothies are as tropical as they can get. Will definitely be stopping by often. Pitaya super smoothie is the bomb!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I cant remember if its vegetarian or full vegan but even if youre not - like me- you will feel inspired by the ambiance of kumbaya. There is a tree in the middle of the communal table. There all these inspirational messages around this tiny yet airy locale, the staff is adorably passionate about the products and DO NOT be fooled by the wholesome good organic ingredients- these people have found a way to delight your tastebuds while lovingly reminding you to love all living things. My daughter had a mango smoothie and it was like none I have ever had. It was sophisticated and thick and yes- spicy. I dont even like spicy. But this. This was beautiful. It wasnt cheap -like $8 but like a great meal.  So satisfying. The hours are strict though - closed by 630p weekdays and must check weekend times. But it was clearly a nod to holistic living where we all equally respect and enjoy time. Next time we are trying the smoothie bowls which people keep raving about. But I feel like I gotta fast for two days first - to be deserving of such holy fare. To make room for the calories. (Lets not confuse healthy ingredients for low calorie ones - hahahaha!). Oh yes. We are going back."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"WOW!!!! What an amazing place and within walking distance of my office! Roots is a small, quaint and modern juicebar that makes all of their own juices daily with the freshest of ingredients. They bottle their juices but can make a smoothie or other juice for you on request too. They serve vegan sustainable food that is absolutely delicious! I had the Lentil bowl and not only did it fill me up, but it was full of flavor! I had their ""Cooler"" green drink which is a blend of Fennel Root, Basil, Cucumber, Lime, and Apple. It was absolutely amazing! I took a Cashew milk to go and also their Avocado toast. The owner said that if I just call him he can deliver the food to me on the days that I work which I think is really awesome. ,It's really nice to have local places like this that serve a variety of different and highly nutritious food. They are so passionate about what they do and tell you the health benefits of everything in their food. NSU employees get a discount too! (Although the discount for checking in on Yelp is better :) ,I am looking forward to having healthy lunches and post-workout drinks/meals now. This place was really awesome! It's definitely small and cannot seat that many people, but it's such a great place!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/24/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Finally the Kendall area has a healthy vegan place! The wellness smoothie... amazing!  The avocado Toast is good for anytime of the day, I recommend and try the superfood salad, it's very good and it also has avocado. I definitely enjoy this place, the atmosphere, the service and the food so many great nutrients, loving roots."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/6/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Super healthy, awesome, delicious, vegan, gluten free place in south Miami just a few steps from LA Fitness, great location and food is delicious, avocado toast is my favorite, summer feels delicious with places like Roots. Also their juices and acai bowls are great!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,I am literally obsessed with everything they offer!! I'm vegan and my boyfriend is a flexitarian; we both love the flavors this place offers in their food!! My only problem is that it is so out of my way lol im never in this area but maybe its for the best because i would probably eat there every day!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I absolutely love this place. Vegan food is delicious and they are super dog friendly. I went there the other day and was with my baby and dog, stressed out and hungry. Not only did they carry my food out but they went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and okay. Thank you for caring so much about your customers, the animals and the planet! Businesses that do good like this get great karma points. Namaste!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/14/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,It's a small cute little vegan Juicebar . Options are great so was the food! The only problem is the prices just a little high.Other  than that  definitely would recomend !
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Maybe it was conditioning today or the run @richie.ramirez_  took me on after training... but I was starving and could not make up my mind... so I got the Frijoles bowl (my fav) for post work out lunch and a Zoodles bowl with vegan bolognese for dinner later.. along with Love Potion #9  all thanks to @rootsjuice for making veggies taste sooo good! Thank you @rootsjuice Love you guys. Stop by for a snack, lunch or a great Acai bowl they got it all."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was looking for a neighborhood place that serves a non dairy option for cappuccinos. I found Roots on google so i gave it a shot. I loved my almond milk cappuccino and cant wait to try them for breakfast or lunch. Such interesting options that fit perfectly into my vegan diet. I appreciate having a healthier choice of food in Miami so thanks Roots for opening close to me. ,I keep coming back for more because the food is so craveable. I love love love everything!!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm a vegan. Hands down the best Vegan restaurant in Miami! The prices are fair and the quality is outstandingly great. The ambience is very chill and cool. Other than the place being small, everything is amazing!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/30/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've recently become a vegan and my friend recommend me to come here after my workout. Let me tell you how amazing the food is here. I always leave here feeling good. I had the frijoles bowl with brown rice, asparagus, chopped up tomatoes and avocados. Very yummy! Also, their smoothies are delicious. A little pricey but worth the try! Recommend for smoothie: Pitaya and the Crave Smoothie."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Was craving an Acai bowl, and saw all the raves about this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. They did not disappoint. I had their regular acai bowl with their vegan smart vanilla protein powder added in. It was so good! I really liked the option of adding protein powder because I had never seen that before. I definitely will be coming back! Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Can't believe it has taken me this long to find this place!  As a vegan I felt out of luck looking for a great place to dine in Kendall.  Scrolling through Instagram I came upon a picture of the Frijoles bowl (my favorite food on the menu) I am glad I found it. ,It is a quick and go place so not restaurant but as the titles suggest it's a bar so just a few tables to dine. Staff was very friendly and made suggestions as it was my first time.  Staff also asked how was if my food selection was what i was expecting , showing how much they care about customers feedback.  The hours are not as convenient for me as a full time employee but gives me a reason to get up early on the weekends."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is such a godsend in kendall where there aren't many vegan/gluten free options (or even relatively healthy options for that matter). Only wish their hours of operation were a bit later. My favorite is the zucchini spaghetti!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I like this juice bar.  The dragon bowl and acai bowl are good.  The salads and smoothies are good too.  I just hate it's so far and in the middle of traffic armageddon lol.  But it is worth going to.  I had the avocado toast, it was ok.  Great place for vegans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,There's no better vegan spot in Miami than Roots. Best Pitaya Juices and bowls in town. The staff is beyond 5 stars. Highly recommended!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/30/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've been vegan now for 4 months and roots has made it so easy! I've been to roots now at least every other week and every visit has been an overall great experience. I've had almost everything on the menu but their breakfast has to be my favorite. Their bowls both the acai and dragon fruit are perfection and the avocado toast is heaven ! Their juices are also a great pick me up, I've had the ""got the beet"" but the ""rise and shine"" is my favorite. My work hours don't usually allow me to swing by for lunch but I've been able to try the fajita bowl and it was very filling the portion size was great and it was perfectly seasoned ! ,The food isn't the only thing I love about roots the ambiance really is what keeps me coming back. From the books put out for guests to read as they wait for their food to the cute foliage put out on the tables it all makes me want to spend my entire day there. On my last visit I saw that it was quite packed and I was very happy to see them doing so well I hope people continue to grow interest in health conscious food. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 starts is because I have heard from people I recommended Roots to that the customer service could be better and up to a certain extent I would have to agree. With that said though Roots is just what Kendall needed may their success be more than they ever expected !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/11/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is very good. There isn't any vegan places around Kendall so this is a great option. Around lunch time it gets packed because the place isn't big but the food truly is delicious. Their avocado toast is probably my favorite and their dragon bowl. They accept Apple Pay so it's convenient. They have very good pre-made juices and shots as well.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This is currently my favorite vegan restaurant in Miami. The bowls are delicious. The juices are phenomenal. The service is excellent. Just wish they had another location further east. Love love love it!!!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/25/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Well definitely a place with healthy food healthy options. Don't look anywhere else if you are vegan , organic , or looking for healthy food , this is the place . I like everything they have . Excellent juices and pita ! The chicken one and avocado are my favorite! But I'm sure they are all good , I tried their dressings really nice stuff , in general this is a little down to earth store serving excellent healthy food options. The ambience it's totally local and family oriented, I saw young students and kids all around of course the prices are also very reasonable . And good service even though they are always busy."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/29/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Walking through Coconut Grove and stumbled across this little hidden gem of a restaurant. I assumed by the name of this joint that it was vegan/vegetarian-friendly or a store for bunnies. To my luck they serve a pretty decent selection of smoothies, fresh drinks, salads, veggie sandwiches and more. ,Cool thing that stood out to me was that all their food was prepared fresh in front of you and you can pretty much smell the vegetables, fruits and breads they make on the spot. ,I wasn't too sure what to pick; fortunately there was this young lady that seemed to be a frequent guest of this restaurant and said it was her favorite in town. She was able to help me decide on what to order. Ended up getting the Baked Tofu Whole Wheat Pita Sandwich with Hummus Spread and a Grasshopper Juice. They brought with it some herbal paste and vinaigrette sauce that added a nice pop to the flavor of the sandwich. I've never been much of a tofu eater but this visit here may have changed that. The food is great, service was nice, convenient location, and my server hooked me up with a nice lil taster of the Açaí Smoothie since it was my first time trying out everything.,I was told you can't go wrong with whatever you select.!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/10/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"What mainly needs to be spoken about in this review is the extraordinary customer service given by each and every employee! So happy to have found a place who not only serves delicious, healthy, vegan food, but also values their customers!,I've driven passed this hidden gem a million times and have always wondered how their food must be. One day, strolling through Yelp I came across this spot and had to try.. best decision.,I ordered a grasshopper juice with added ginger. Deliciousness!!!! The ginger isn't normally added, but I requested it for those added health benefits.,I also enjoyed a vegan bean burger in a pita.. finger licking good! - I will definitely be returning very soon!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I ordered the solid white chicken sandwich with the whole wheat pita, and my sister ordered their regular garden salad. The food was nothing out of this world, it was okay. The service wasn't great either, the guy took forever to attend us even though he noticed we were standing there for about 15 minutes and aside from the fact that he didn't notice, when he came up to us he wasn't the friendliest. I can definitely say that if you're looking into any vegan/healthy places, this isn't the ideal place to go."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/9/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Fast, friendly, and delicious! Definitely a local hangout, this spot offers the BEST healthy and vegan friendly food options. As a huge meat lover myself I usually feel unsatisfied if my meal doesn't have at least some type of protein in it, but the last carrot does their wraps/pitas so well that it's just as filling and extremely satisfying. ,Don't forget to ask for the green vinaigrette sauce, it's absolutely delicious and will make even the biggest veggie hater eat all of their veggies! ,The juices and smoothies are all made fresh and taste great. My personal favorite is the grasshopper which is pineapple juice with a shot of wheatgrass. ,Prices are fair and staff is great. Would highly recommend if you're looking for something healthy but also satisfying"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/18/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Cute little place we ran into. Healthy choices. Mostly salads and sandwiches, but hearty sandwiches. I was with a vegan and the server, young kid, took the time to explain the dressings, the veggies and even gave us a recommendation for something not on the menu. Well we went with that. Falafel with some secret green sauce - that if we could have just had a bucket this review would be longer. The young kid really made this place even nicer. Real down to earth and attentive. Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Kendall has a hot new vegan spot. Good location and easy to reach.,Their salads are so fresh and made with a great combo of ingredients. ,Prices are good except for their $8 per juice. $5 is what they should go for.,I still give them 5-stars because the food is so good and this is a true ""healthy vegetarian"" place since so many other vegan restaurants have so many carb-filled bread and pasta dishes where this place focuses on vegetables and beans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/19/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this place. Great salad, lentil bowl, vegan deserts, and juices. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is a positive vibe."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/13/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I come to this place as often as I possibly can! They never disappoint and they have such a friendly staff! My staples here are The Crave smoothie, the Acai bowl, and the Avocado Toast ! Also, if it's available, a slice of their vegan carrot cake is my obsession!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Quality quality quality!!!! This is one of the very few all natural all organic all vegan places in Kendall. It's easy to tell it's in high demand because they always have a line out the door! I always order ahead but there food and smoothies are amazing and definitely worth the money! Feels like you're doing your body good! Get more locations!!! Or a bigger space!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem quite daunting and complicated. For me it's about making one change at a time and not all at once. This vegan friendly restaurant is my go-to the days I don't feel creative in the kitchen or right out have no clue what I'm going to cook that day. It's a 20 minute drive from my home but well worth it. There are no words to describe how good everything on the menu is and I mean everything!! My favorites are the Dragon Bowl for breakfast and Zoodles Bowl for lunch. If you want to feel brand new eat @ Roots. Your body will definitely thank you!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this vegan juice bar/ cafe. They have great options are different types of juice and healthy snack juices like acai bowl, dragon bowl, quinoa bowl and avocado toast. Not only the food is delicious, people are friendly, it's a perfect Instagram spot as well. ;),I tried the dragon bowl, it's huge and sosososo good! I didn't expect a layer of granola at the bottom too. Love it! The granola is no generic, full of flavor and various seeds. ,Will come back to try other stuff for sure!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love roots juice bar, it's one of my favorite places to eat usually on Sunday's for lunch (They changed their times and they're opened every day now which is a plus!).I usually get the lentil bowl, and it comes with brown rice and a side of veggies. I have tried most of their food bowls on their menu, and all of them are delicious! Their vegan chocolate cake is amazing! Also, they do have signs by the register that states that food may take up to 20 mins just because their food is served fresh, so there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Excellent vegan place!! The food is great and very healthy. The avocado toast is amazing and every dish is fresh and delicious. I wish there are more Roots locations. A must!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I received an add from Yelp, telling me about healthy eating places near me, so I decided to give this place a try, I'm not really a vegan but really enjoy healthy foods. Wanting to give his local place a try I ordered a few things, Dragon bowl... delicious, Morning Bagel... WOW, Lentil bowl....double WOW, I also decided to try the Avocado Toast because all the reviews ranted about it, I think it was too salty, a little less salty & I think it will be great. Overall the food was a total success, I will definitely be coming back to try some more items from their menu"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I came out to Miami during my sister's best friend's wedding. This place happened to be next to the hotel we were staying at, so I decided why not give this place a try? This is a raw vegan restaurant and juice bar, although they cook their food. For my meal I had the zucchini noodles with vegan Bolognese and a green soup. I really enjoyed the zucchini pasta (zoodles) because they really fill you up and trick your brain into thinking your eating spaghetti. The Vegan Bolognese was very thick and chunky in consistency like its traditional meat counterpart. My green soup was very well seasoned and I could appreciate the distinct taste of broccoli in it. The staff here are incredibly friendly. The day I came in, the place was packed with a line out the door and despite this the nice girl at the counter stopped what she was doing for a moment and gave me a knife when I asked for one. I don't go to Miami very much, but if I do, I will be sure to stop by here again to try more of their items!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been hesitant to try this place due to the location being in a very heavy traffic area. Recently I stopped by for the first time and I was really impressed with the place. I ordered a dragon fruit smoothie, a bagel with vegan cream cheese and a vegetable soup and everything was delicious. Making a healthy vegetable soup is hard to do and they do it so well. I love that they use organic ingredients and environmentally friendly to go packaging. This is a great spot if you're looking for a healthy or organic option."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"One of my favorite vegan spots in south miami. My favorite is the bean bowl and zucchini pasta. Not once have I been disappointed when I go to this place. Everything from the juice, smoothies, food and dessert never disappoints. Very attentive staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/9/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing service . Staff had excellent knowledge of everything and let us try different fruit because adding it in the smoothie. This is a hole in the wall because I would've never noticed if it was for a friend who recently went from vegetarian to vegan and wanted to try this from Yelp reviews. ,It's very peaceful and quiet. Parking says 1 hour only."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great Vegan Friendly options. Very clean and friendly staff.  Food was really tasty. I recommend the Quinua Bowl, the Bean Bowl, and the Açaí bowl."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super fresh and tasty. Made me feel more alive when I ate this food. Great variety and high quality food. Definitely one of the best vegan/vegetarian spots in this area. Wish that there was more space to sit inside.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/26/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The customer service and cleanliness of this place is impeccable. Loved its all plant-based menu. It's a must-go for vegans and vegetarians in the Kendall area.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"A solid 4.5 stars...This juice bar is exactly what West Kendall needed. Its fast, delicious, convenient, and vegan. It's tucked away in a shopping center behind a hotel so it's hard to find. But no worries, plug it in your GPS and it takes you right there. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Very simple and inviting décor. They have an array of juices and smoothies. Their food menu is small but definitely not lacking in flavor. All the menu items are plant based and for the most part organic. ,I tried: ,Avocado toast: The flavor was delicious. I just wish the avocado had thicker chunks and not have so much of a creamy consistency. The addition of the chia seeds were exceptional and gave it the final touch. ,Vegetable soup: Once again amazing flavor but I felt all I got were blended vegetables. I like when there is heartiness in my soup and I can actually crunch on a vegetable or two. ,Dragonfruit Acai Bowl: O.M.G! Best bowl I have ever had! Hands down. The toppings were so delicious. Banana, strawberry, kiwi, blueberries, coconut chips, granola, and chia seeds decorated the bowl beautifully and sat on top of the perfectly blended dragon fruit. Its a must order. ,and last but not least....The wonderful Lentil Bowl: I loved this so much. The lentils were so so so good! I tip my hat off to the wonderful person who seasoned this dish so beautifully. This bowl comes with a heeping serving of lentils, brown rice, and grilled vegetables. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Portions were the perfect size. ,I will definitely be coming back to this location. I know for sure I will be ordering The dragonfruit bowl and the Lentil Bowl. Two delicious concoctions that are worth trying! ,Cannot wait to try their juices. ,P.S. parking can be a bit of a pain. Don't fret, when you drive into the small plaza there is more parking if you keep driving straight."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love this place! I am excited to find places like this (Vegan/Vegetarian options!) in Miami / Kendall area! The atmosphere is very nice, have many options on their menu. I had the Quinoa bowl and Love potion (beet, pineapple, pear, ginger, chia) juice!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So i'm not vegan or even health-conscious over my food, but after having a friend talk my ear off about how much she was craving an acai bowl, i decided i must try one for myself. ,Roots is not at all on my way. I happened to be in the area and Yelp recommended them when i searched for a local Juice Bar. ,Let me tell you, i am so glad i stopped in here. The atmosphere is adorable: trendy white couch, stool seating along the windows, and a communal picnic table with an artificial tree sprouting in the middle. There's open cooler with fresh beds of wheatgrass, their pressed and bottled juices, and other assorted drinks. The kitchen is partially visible from the register so you can see most goings-on with your food. Their menu can be found on clipboards all around the shop so ordering is more expedient. ,I ordered the Acai Bowl and their Lentil Bowl. Immediately, the young woman said I made good choices but that it would be a lot of food if it was all just for me. I absolutely loved that. I let her know that I was planning on eating the Lentil Bowl later in the day, and asked if it would keep until then. She rang me up and said she'd fulfill the acai bowl order first and whenever i felt it was a good time to go, she'd fulfill the lentil bowl order so i could leave with the freshest food.,The Acai Bowl was the first i've ever had, and i may have ruined myself for any other. Their portions are large and filling; their toppings are liberal and a real treat. The bowl had a multitude of toppings, but also the bottom of the bowl had a generous layer of granola and chia seeds. It was definitely my happiest food experience in 2016. Every spoonful was savored and by the time i was near finished, a gentlemen had dropped off a warm brown bag with my lentil bowl. ,So in the end, I've been trying to give myself an excuse to get back into this area and stop by Roots again. 5/5 in everything: quality, service, value. No other bowls have met my standards."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/4/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,So far I have been here twice and each time I really did enjoy it. The first time around I ordered a smoothie and the avocado toast. My husband and I really enjoyed both. The second time around we did have one of their bowls which was pretty tasty. I do like the vibe in there. It can be a little to warm in there though. I definitely plan on going back again. It is a great healthy option regardless if you are vegan or vegetarian or not.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts. 100%recommended."

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Incredible. Shared the fajita bowl (without the spicy peppers), avocado toast, and a butternut squash soup and it was AMAZING! Even my non-vegan family member thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back.,Also, the presentation was so cute! I'm just digging everything about it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/20/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Such a cute little juice bar! I live in the area but only recently heard about it. When I heard there was an a vegan all plant-based foodie heaven near me I was all about it. I didn't want to get my hopes up as far as taste because I feel I am really picky. I ordered the lentil bowl and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. The lentil bowl comes with brown rice, broccoli, zucchini and carrots - can't complain. I'll be back to try juice and breakfast bagel."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/15/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been working on going vegan for some time now and the food here is AMAZING! I am a fan of the dragon fruit bowl, coffee, and fajita bowl! They are expensive but most health food places are so it is expected. ,I have to take out two stars, not because of the food (which I encourage everyone to go try), but because of the customer service. I have realized they are becoming more popular and now are much more frantic, making more mistakes and, even making rude comments at times.  Many times, when I call in to place an order to avoid waiting in the crowded little seating area, they don't pick up. I recently mentioned this to one of the employees (I think he could have been the manager, but I am not sure), and he told me ""I can't do 5 things at once!"" I think they lack a little bit of professionalism, but it's still great food in a convenient area close to where I live. so mehhhh..."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/21/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is right by school and it's pretty great. It is only vegan so they do not have many options although I love vegan foods. I got a avocado/kale salad of some sort with a spicy sauce. That was delicious! Downside part of this place is the wait and how busy it gets! A tip would probably be to open up earlier
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Ok, so I had not tried an Acai bowl because as most things are now in days I thought it was a fad hipster dish. I thought it's a smoothie in a bowl how great can that be...OMG WAS I WRONG. Yes, to some people it's still a fad to go vegan because that is the cool thing now in days, I'm not vegan but I do have a plant based diet day a week. The acai bowl is toooo die for. I can die and go to heaven now, so so so good! I don't even have words to describe the perfection that the acai bowl is. I'm going to try the avocado toast next time I come here."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Please visit this place whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, you will fall in love with the food, açaí bowls as well as the cozy, coffee shop ambience. Try the frijoles bowl and the avocado toast."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super good Vegan place in West Kendall. Try the bowls and the juices. The avocado toast is super delicious as well. #savetheanimals
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is pretty awesome. Their menu ranges from options of lentil soups, to sandwiches, salads, juices, energy bowls, and anything in between. It's a vegan's heaven. It is a bit pricey, but that expected at most of these health and ethically conscious restaurants. I still have a ton of meals to try out on their menu, and so far I've loved their lentils, dragon bowls, avocado toast, juices, smoothies, and a few other options-basically everything has been great thus far. ,I like to come here often, usually whenever I'm in the Kendall area. Whenever I bike or drive out to the Kendall Regal Village, I like to grab a bite to eat here if I'm hungry, especially if I have just finished a workout at the LA Fitness, or finished a film at the theater, or finished picking up art supplies at Michael's, or have been spending my afternoon at Barnes & Nobles. Honestly this little mall plaza has just about everything I love, and it's my own personal escape on Kendall Drive. So the location of this vegan restaurant just makes it that much better. I used to come here a lot more back when I worked in the area, but I still come here often enough because of my gym membership and the other stores. I'm surprised it took so long for me to write a review. ,Parking is free and it's a private lot. There's also bike parking, so it's perfect. And free wifi! So between here and the Barnes & Nobles, it's a great location to study or read if you want to get a change of scenery from the library or your house. ,The staff is friendly and I enjoy their service. No complaints. You do get 20% off of your purchase on check-in, so keep that handy! ,I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here, as I've been trying to introduce him to more vegan options and vegan restaurants. It's difficult to convince him because he eats meat and is stubborn, but when I come with him I will recommend he gets one of their higher calorie/higher protein options, since that's his main hesitation to vegan food-he thinks it's not enough calories or protein for the price, especially for someone like him who is trying to gain weight. *sigh* There are plenty of options for everyone, even for those who work out and are looking for plant based protein.  ,Overall it's a great experience, tasty and healthy vegan food, great location and convenience of being right off Kendall Drive, and free bike and car parking. Did I mention how that is so perfect? They take card and cash, too. I only wish they stayed open later."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/9/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I yelped ""salads"" and this place popped up. On the drive there, I was excited to have found a place like this in Kendall (when I think juice bar and vegan, I think Miami Beach). The cashier was kind and made a suggestion for my order. I am always happy to hear suggestions, especially when it's my first time. I ordered a caramel macchiato (with almond milk--as per her recommendation) and it was delicious! Not bitter, not overly sweet. I also ordered an avocado toast--light yet satisfying. I tend to go overboard with new things so I fully intend to go back tomorrow to try a smoothie! ,My one complaint is how tiny the space is! There isn't much space to wait for your meal if it's to go. If you choose to dine-in, the seating is very VERY limited. Granted, this was lunch time so I completely understand. I will return during non-peak hours."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Being a vegan, I can tell you this place is a great spot! They have delicious food bowls, my favorite being the Dragon bowl! They also have several other lunch items that are extremely tasty and fresh, I would definitely recommend the zoodles and avocado toast... their desserts are also amazing, most of them are vegan and again, very very tasty! I have tried several of their smoothies and they are also very fresh, made to order, and absolutely delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/12/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is Vegan but you don't need to be Vegan to eat here! This place's menu is EXTREMELY good. I have been there more than 12 times this year alone (it's a little far from my house but if i could go more I would) The açaí bowls are so refreshing and make you feel satisfyingly full because of how healthy it is. The peanut butter smoothie is fantastic (I'm not really a big fan of peanut butter but I still get it) the people are always welcoming and sweet. I really enjoy the environment as well, it's a cute little place and you can sit around outside as well. This is my favorite place to eat. I'm not the healthiest person in the world but I really do crave the açaí bowls often."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am writing this review purely from the point of view as a customer, I used to work here a year ago and I will not relate my work experience to the establishment... The menu has a nice variety of choices to get, my favorite are the wellness smoothie (a fresh tasting green smoothie) and the crave smoothie(vanilla/cinnamon goodness). Another favorite of mine are the zoodles (zuccinni  noodles), they are served with a vegan bolognese sauce. I used to use the Yelp check in/20% off when I would come here but now they are saying they aren't accepting it anymore. If that is the case, take it off Yelp because it is misleading. This visit I ordered an avocado toast and a crave smoothie. The toast came out quickly but 15 minutes later I'm still here waiting for my smoothie while the girls behind the counter chat about stair masters and working out, usually they bring the food all together. As of customer service, associates could be friendlier maybe try smiling. Vegan = HAPPY"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/23/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,the time to get the food  it is my only concern...every thing else it is GOOODD AND FRESH.. i highly recommended to any vegan friends
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not vegan by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I do love my smoothies & bowls and Roots delivers on both! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl. I've had Dragon/Pitaya bowls around the US and even internationally. And in my opinion Roots' version is the best. All the toppings work well together and everything is o nicely presented. ,I have also tried their juice cleanse 2x. I do pretty well on 3 day cleanses with rarely a headache. They will offer suggestions on how to deal with any effects. The first time, I received all clear juices. The 2nd time, I received some of the same juices plus one thicker juice and one cash mylk. I think that the addition of the thicker drinks should help those that have a hard time with cleanses as the thicker juices/mylk are pretty filling.  ,The avocado juice was delish and the cash mylk was also tasty. I do not like celery and three of the juices contain celery. The green ones I chugged. While the beet juice was more palatable. I loved the morning juice.  Mind you, this is just my personal opinion. All in all, it was a great cleanse.,I have been coming here since it was the place for the best cuppie cakes on the planet (cough, cough). And the staff and owners have always been super friendly and welcoming. The shop is so cute and offers seating both inside & out. Orders are prepared once placed so if you are in a rush, you can place your order online right here on Yelp! And it will be ready for you to pick up."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Hands down my favorite Vegan Food Spot in Miami! My favorite thing is the ""Fajitas Bowl"" and the Love Potion #9 Juice. I also like the Frijoles Bowl and Dragon Fruit Bowl. The place is small but I love it inside. The atmosphere is good and everything is made to order so it tastes very fresh. I hope that they open up more restaurants in the near future and they should really think about opening on Sundays."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Roots is a very tasty juice bar, it has all the vegan favorites. I'm not vegan but I do like from time to time a healthy alternative. ,One of my side jobs is next door so it makes a nice and convenient meal/shake for me during my lunch break. ,I usually have my favorite the PB&j shake. Very tasty and full of flavor. ,If you've never had Avo bread before make sure you ask for it. It's tasteful and light! It'll sure make your tastebuds happy. ,If in the area and looking for something healthy and different try Roots out. It's sure not to disappoint"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/9/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,My go-to place for acai/dragon bowls and healthy vegan food. Everything I've tried was delicious. The place is also very cute and simple and the service is great.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/3/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely love the acai bowls from roots. They are reasonably priced, have tons of toppings and tastes delicious! The shop is really nice and clean inside, however, it is kind of small which makes it feel very cramped when it is very busy. There's not so many places to sit so I always opt for take out. The best way to do take out here is to either call ahead or order through yelp because there's not too much space to wait around if it's very busy. Made that mistake once and felt super claustrophobic. There isn't that much seating, there's a little community table which is cute but when the line gets long it feels like people are right on top of you. The decorations and style of the place are cute though. Definitely a cute little spot to hang out if it's not busy but if it is I would come back later or do take out. The food is definitely worth it though. It's one of the only vegan/juice bars in the area that have fresh fruits and are good quality without being overpriced."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Delicious place! Smoothies are alright, but let me tel you! THAT FAJITA BOWL WAS AMAZING!!! Prices were pretty average for a juice bar, not bad. staff was very friendly and attentive and hardworking! This place is a beautiful place spreading the vegan message. I like the steps towards being more green. Also I love that they had vegan smoothie bowls! Food was good, the smoothie was just what I needed!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"GO TO ROOTS JUICEBAR! I have tried almost every vegan place in Miami and Roots is by far, my favorite place to eat at. Compare all the prices for an acai bowl between every vegan place and look back at Roots. It is very affordable and their food will fill you up. They have a variety of meals and smoothies, which makes them my go-to when I am near kendall. I am excited for their new location opening in Doral."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Very clean great smoothies great juices. Great food . Highly recommend vegan or vegaterian or just healthy. I have been here a few times now and the food is always delicious. I love the lentil bowl, and you get so much! It is a little expensive but these types of places always seem to be. Love that the menu is all vegan, makes it so easy to order.Had the kale juice and a comfort bowl for my wife. They were both good. ,PS: Pet friendly."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First time customer, went in for the Açaí bowl but they were out. Chose the Dragon bowl instead--very appealing to the eyes and delicious to the palate, and very filling too. The music played there was a little too loud if trying to have a conversation with friends, but otherwise a perfect place to hangout. Love the vegan themed art & decor. Friendly staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOVE! The food is delicious, nutritious and eco-friendly. The service is super fast and friendly and the environment/ decor is awesome (they always play the best music too). I am a huge fan of their menu, which is 100% vegan (and I'm not even vegan). I highly recommend the frijoles bowl, the morning bagel and the dragon bowl...YUM! Also, if you're ever feeling sick, take one of their ""good and well"" natural juice shots. It has cayenne pepper in it, so if you're not comfortable with spice, you may want to stay away. But seriously, I've started taking these shots when I'm sick and they make me feel SO much better! Overall, a great go-to place for delicious, healthy, feel-good food and great service."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I honesty have to thank the owner for this change. I remembered this place having sweets and I had no Idea I had a vegan friendly restaurant right around the corner. I am transitioning into veganism after getting educated and realizing the damaging affects of processed foods, meats and dairy. Was so happy to find out the food was not only delicious but wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. I love the story of this place and the fact that it cares about what they provide you with. The juices are expensive yes but do have a blend of a lot of different things that help your nutrition . I'm your new loyal customer and can't wait to order more meals throughout my week! ,Thank you! :),P.S. Please make a loyalty program!"

Considering most vegan places are on the pricier end, I didn't think this place was so bad. I had the Pitaya smoothie with dragon fruit, mango banana etc. this vibrant drink was tasty and very filling. I can't wait to go and try some of their food."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/11/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First I'd like to make clear that I am NOT a vegan, and I had no idea this was a vegan place, but that didn't deter me from trying out their smoothies. They clearly have a fan base, because at 930 AM when they open there was already lines. , I decided to try a Crave smoothie consisting of Vanilla bean, dates, bananas, cinnamon, chia seeds, cacao and Almond milk. It wasn't bad. I also ordered the Breakfast Bagel with Cashew Cream cheese and spinach on a wheat bagel. I knew I would like the bagel, because I love anything with Cashew, I wasn't crazy about the spinach but I ate it anyways ( my first time ever eating spinach) , I respect other people's choices of what they put in their bodies, but I couldn't live on a vegan diet. It's a very nice small place with lots of employees, the service was friendly and I can see myself returning to try some of their cold pressed juices.,I tried their cold pressed juices and I didn't care for them. Ginger is too overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the RISE & SHINE Juice. ,Also I wonder why ""healthy"" food is so expensive if it doesn't contain many of the preservatives and ingredients as ""unhealthy"" food does. I imagine less ingredients less spendings."

The location itself is a bit hidden, but the food was delicious. When I saw the menu, I got super excited because I am always looking for new vegetarian/vegan friendly places that serve fresh, tasty food. ,The cashier recommended the quinoa bowl,,and it did not disappoint! Quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, avocado, tomatoes, broccoli, and more in what tasted like a basil pesto type sauce. Yummmm! ,I will definitely be back to try more!!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/1/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Been coming here more because I've been training for work next door. They have great vegan options which makes it great for people who go plant based.,I have had their lentils and frijoles bowl for lunch and they were good but wasn't satisfying for my cravings. The food was very filling and nutritious. The portion was also good enough to share with 2 people. Smoothies are great too. They aren't loaded with sugar and have tons of antioxidants.,My favorite there would be the acai bowl. It has varieties of fruit other than strawberries and bananas. The granola is nice and crunchy and adds the perfect amount of sweetness. They also have almonds and toasted coconut flakes which give each bit a different taste. The serving size is pretty large and can be shared with 2 people. The price I would say is still pricey.,I am now giving them a 4 of 5 because of their philosophy. They are purely plant based and believe in high quality ingredients."

This place was a staple not just because they had veg options, but they're awesome. Pretty much all my Miami friends love this place, and most aren't vegan/vegetarian. Best falafel sandwiches, hands down. I've been in NYC for 13 years now, and this place is still my favorite falafel joint."

Definitely will be back!

I came to do some work and the ladies were lovely and kind. They make you feel very welcomed. They truly gave me the ""Wynwood"" vibe. I ordered just a basic hazelnut latte with coconut milk and it hit the spot. They have plenty of drinks they offer. Also my fellow vegan friends they have food for us too! They also offer free phone charging outside of the front door. It's a little hidden off the main st but it's perfect to have a little hideaway spot. Thank you! This place is definitely a gem."

I heard about their vegan icecream sandwiches so I decided to come here instead of Panther.,Wow their coffee was great! I got the tap cold brew coffee, and he put hazelnut in mines. The coffee tap is right next to the register so I got to see how it bubbled. I loved it! My friend ordered the iced matcha latte, and that tasted amazing too.,Also- they do coffee ripple which is foam designs which can be customized. It was such a different and cool addition. I kinda just wanted to keep it and never drink it.,Oh! To get back to the icecream sandwich that brought me here. The vegan flavor was vanilla rice flavor, almonds, sandwiched in chocolate chip almond cookies. It was really really good. ,Seriously guys, come here. Its worth it."

Food was delicious, staff friendly and prices reasonable, though portions were a bit on the smaller side. There are even a few vegan options available. I had the Curry roasted vegetable bowl, which was very good though it had one dissonant garnish (basil). Overall, a great experience and I am glad we have it as anew option in South Miami. Will definitely be coming back!"
"87 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33130",2/11/2017,$$,4,Stanzione 87,"Owner is super kind, when one of the waiters accidentally messed up my order with cheese, the owner replaced my dish with a vegan salad without me having asked. Food is also delicious. Good music too. Place is great for family, friends, casual dates, etc."
"5958 S Dixie Hwy, South Miami, FL 33143",6/27/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,I happen to stumble upon this place after driving daily by it as I live down the street. Finally came in one day to try it out and haven't stopped coming since. I am vegan and it is difficult to find good places with vegan options in Miami. It's gotten better but many yummy vegan places are on the beach or other neighborhoods further from me. The bean bowl is my favorite and Jake is also my favorite! He always makes my experience full of joy and pleasant and his smile is contagious! New favorite go to for sure :)
"5958 S Dixie Hwy, South Miami, FL 33143",7/10/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,"Easily one of my new favorites, especially when you're looking for healthier options. Located in the new area of South Miami, there is ample street parking and this place is huge, lots of seating available. When you walk in you head straight towards the counter and place your order, they give you a buzzer and you collect your order when the buzzer rings. Overall the food is tasty, fresh and they have a variety of vegan and vegetarian options."
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/30/2016,$$,5,Threefold Cafe,"It's always a relief when restaurant staff enthusiastically accommodate dietary restrictions! After sitting down and exploring the menu, I asked our waiter what he recommended for a vegan, and he unhesitatingly offered me an array of detailed suggestions. I highly recommend the corn fritters without sour cream (sub the feta-filled guacamole with avocado). And their cappuccino with almond milk was delicious :) Great staff. Beautiful ambience. I'm definitely looking forward to returning!"
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/25/2017,$$,5,Threefold Cafe,"We've been there twice. Sunday about 11:00am and there's a line out the door. It'll be fabulous once Giralda construction is complete and it will have foot traffic only. Brianna our adorable server came up with a vegan platter for me: sautéed spinach, roasted tomatoes, sliced avocado, hashbrowns and Zack's Bakery bread, along with an almond milk latté.  All delicious."
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/3/2017,$$,3,Threefold Cafe,"I have been to Threefold multiple times now, and every time I leave, I always feel the same. The food is good and fresh, but it never feels worth the bill I get at the end. I definitely think it's a bit overpriced for what you get. This time around, I had the chai tea latte which was great and the phenomenal fungi. Now, I am a mushroom lover and I've had this dish before, but this time it felt like there were way too many mushrooms, not enough goat cheese, and for the price and amount of mushrooms, I really wish they'd give two pieces of bread instead of just one. ZTB bread is the best! My sister got the same but without the goat cheese as she tries to eat mainly vegan..vegans beware, there aren't a ton of options and many of the dishes specifically say they cannot be modified. My mom had the waffles, which she enjoyed, but nothing I couldn't make at home myself. Again, the food is good... just missing that extra something that makes you leave saying Wow! That was amazing! And not caring what the price tag was."
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/17/2018,$$,5,Threefold Cafe,Maria our server was amazing and funny. Fresh and organic. Vegan choices too.  Breakfast all day. Beautiful decor you feel you are beachside in Australia somewhere.  Coffee and tea and fresh juices. No alcohol here. Will be back for more.  #CoralGables
"1429 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/30/2018,$$,5,Jasmine Sushi & Thai Cuisine,"By far my favorite discovery as an FIU student. A gem tucked next to Publix, Jasmine's has easily made my list of top restaurants to return to. I have had birthday and graduation gatherings here because nothing feels more celebratory to me than their tofu massaman curry. I have yet to try tofu as flavorful as theirs, making them a great vegan / vegetarian friendly option. Their lunch prices are very cheap with great portion sizes. It's a great trip to feel fully satisfied at a low cost.,The owner, Richard, is also friendly and approachable. He acknowledges his regulars and makes conversation to make them feel at home. His team is very fast and friendly, and they already know by now that I'm ordering their delicious curry whenever I visit. Their veggie rolls are delicious as well, and my family has enjoyed every time we have come."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",12/11/2013,$$,3,The Honey Tree,"the tomato avocado salad is amazing. Try any of the shakes delicious and filing. as some of the food is not very filling since its all vegan. the lentils were very good also. was able to shop for some organic products while i was there. great shop, great service."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/20/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Best healthy food option in the neighborhood and usually packed at lunchtime as they offer homemade vegan dishes and have inside seating available.  A little pricey as i usually spend between $10-15 for lunch and a drink, but well worth it.  They also have everything under the sun to whole food multi-vitamins, raw chocolate, organic juices, books on healthy lifestyles, and even a talented musician comes in and plays on certains days for the lunch crowd.  They're also very informative and helpful with any questions you may have."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/18/2014,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"I had the vegan chicken empanada, good with their hot sauce.  I also had their pasta.  It tasted fresh, great marinara sauce, but it was microwaved.  That machine should not be in a health food store.  Overall good experience.  I'll be back.  $10"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/6/2011,$$,5,The Honey Tree,With not too many vegetarian places around The Honey Tree is a gem. Go for lunch or even just to grab a few healthy snacks. They have vegan cookies and other baked goods that Taste great. Great tasting lunches and a selection of healthy drinks. Live healthy.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2009,$$,4,The Honey Tree,Lunch: around noon (12:30-3:30) but they also save leftover if you run too early or late. Food tasts realy fresh and amazing. Great cakes (some are vegan) and a nice place to buy food and more healthy product.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/20/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Every time I am in this area, I always try to stop here for lunch.  It opens around Noon and they serve lunch until they run out, which is by 2pm.  They have a variety of healthy soups, salads, and main courses that are prepared by the owner and his family, on site, daily.  You go to the counter and tell them what you want and the amount you want.  I suggest you try a variety of dishes.  Then they weight your plate and that is what you pay.  It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for - a great, home cooked, healthy lunch.  There are several tables inside for dining.  It can get pretty busy around lunchtime.  I wish they had outdoor seating as well.  They also sell a variety of bottled drinks, healthy organic grocery items, organic lotions, and aromatherapy items.  It is much more personalized than Whole Foods and with a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to eat clean, vegetarian, or vegan."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Healthy, homemade vegan cuisine at its best. I love that they have different options, almost in a cafeteria-style line, available on weekdays. If only they could start offering dinner, I would certainly come back here more often! ,The store itself is very small, better to take the food to go, and offers only a minimal amount of grocery items. ,Great place for a quick office lunch to go."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",4/28/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,Totally recommend this vegan haven. Or anyone that cares about ingredients or just good food. Friendly staff and the owner is more than likely always there. Not enough seating during busy lunch time hours and not enough parking. But well worth the wait!
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",1/17/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Truly one of the best health food stores / vegan restaurants in the city.,The staff is incredible from Sirhan to Michelle and the food is fresh, delicious and healthy.,Definitely a gem of a place & a great lunch spot"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",4/28/2015,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Great place for a healthy vegetarian lunch, the food is fresh, tasty and made with love. The people working there are very friendly. Ps they also have yummy vegan deserts"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/30/2013,$$,5,The Honey Tree,My favorite place for a lunch break. A vegans dream. Me and my boyfriend have been coming here for years the service is amazing and it is the nicest ambiance for a regular locals spot. I love my honey tree
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2012,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Call me stupid,  but I had no idea this place was a Vegan/Vegetarian health market. ,""STUPID!"",I was looking for a detox after consuming a week's worth of Quaker cereal. ,Unfortunately for me, I forgot I was living in Miami, where lots of folks take care of themselves, thus juicing/detoxes were to no avail. ,What kind of loser buys detoxes?,*raises hand*,Things continued to get gradually worse as I made the fatal mistake of asking if they sold Meat and/or Dairy products. The store clerk emerged in vitriol --- a blank stare --- I thought I was going to be hanged on 'The Honey Tree' (wherever it's hidden).,There's a counter towards the back where they make juices and homemade-vegan food, plus a small area where you can sit, chat, and have bite of some of their delicacies.,I had a portion of their lasagna --- wait that has dairy, what?,Okay, it wasn't lasagna.,What tasted like lasagna was actually just zucchini, tomato sauce, and roasted peppers.  ,These Vegans really do well in duping the uninformed."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"My rating is based just on the food and juice bar, as the other items I find expensive.  For the lunch bar, the food is fairly priced, fresh and delicious.  Most places in Miami that offer healthy vegan and vegetarian food are not so gourmet and usually cost your whole weeks income.  Loving the Honey Tree right now for a day when I want to go get some good wholesome food and stay under $8 usually.  They change the menu daily so there is always a new dish to try, and huge selection of juices and smoothies to keep you from getting bored."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",3/19/2018,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Best Vegan food in Miami.  Owner holding strong to Local products and being in business for 23 plus years.,Support Local and be the change we want to see in Miami!!!,they just got a new Alkaline Water disperser that is so promising and very affordable!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Lunch buffet is reasonably priced and there is alot to choose from. The food is in the back of the store and upfront they sell vegan products like soap, shampoo etc. I didn't buy anything from the store but I'd go back based off the food."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2017,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a hidden gem, especially for vegetarians and vegans, although everyone will enjoy the food here. The Honey Tree is a small natural food store with a cafe in the back offering daily made vegetarian and vegan specialties. ,I went on a Wednesday, which luckily is lasagna day at the Honey Tree. They had two types of lasagnas - regular with vegetarian ""beef,"" and gluten free with vegan cheese. Both were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. They also have tons of other food options daily, as well as a smoothie bar. ,My favorite part is that they have a different vegan cake every day, and they're all delicious. Sometimes I go just to pick up a slice!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Delicious vegan fresh food sold by the pound! I was there for lunch and had experienced their daily buffet! :) I had a dish full of food including veggie rice, asparagus, kale, potatoes with spinach, veggie quesadilla, shaved Brussels sprouts, and avocado salad ($13.32).  Also, i added a veggie spring roll ($3.50) for lunch. For dessert, I took a fruit salad with almond cluster to go which was delicious ($6.99). The fruita included papaya, mango, starfruit, kiwi, and pineapple. I ate so much and was definitely satisfied! Will most definitely come back! Also! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Finally, parking is freeeee which is a nice perk!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/3/2018,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"the honey tree has closed. this is a tragedy. best lunch place for vegan food. again, this is a major tragedy."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/11/2017,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"I'm not a vegan but I love fresh delicious vegan food which is exactly what I get here 3 days a week after hot yoga down the block. They have a limited amount, lunch only so If your interested don't come late afternoon or you'll be disappointed.  I feel like I'm really feeding my body well when I'm here. Yummy too."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",2/4/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Food is exquisitely fresh, vegan, and delicious.  They bring in prepared salads, quiches, and soups at around 11:30 AM, and they serve until it runs out.  You stand at the counter and point to which you would like to try, and they scoop it onto a plate and weigh it.  They often sell out of items like the tofu-spinach quiche because folks place phone orders to reserve a slice (sooo good!  Don't slam tofu quiche until you try it!).,I had roasted butternut squash, roasted broccolini, marinated portobello slices, a competent tomato/avocado salsa, and a cucumber-mint salad with chick peas.  My friend let me taste the quiche and I ended up eating half of it.  We finished the meal by splitting a fresh vegan, gluten-free strawberry cake, and it was soft, sweet, and pretty.,They also make juices and smoothies and have lots of vegan baked goodies that look scrumptious.  Did not shop the market, but it looks pretty well stocked.,The genuine, tie-dyed hippie staff are extremely nice and quirky.  Stay away if you're wearing Lululemon and a sneer.  The price for lunch was certainly more expensive than a burger and fries- but this is  real honest cooking served with warmth.  You'll leave feeling nourished, body and soul."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/10/2015,$$,5,The Honey Tree,If I can come here everyday I would. I love this little place. At first I never knew about the warm food that's for lunch on a daily basis. All vegan and vegetarian. Service is so nice and friendly. Honey tree is all in one. Its a health/organic mini market. Love love love this place.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/18/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a great place to stop in for supplements or speciality vegan food items (e.g nutritional yeast) if you don't have time to go all the way to Whole Foods.  I was impressed by the variety of vitamins and supplements for a small store.  I also picked up some nutritional yeast, chia seeds, an vegan gravy packets while I was there.  I can't wait to go back and try the smoothies and food at the cafe."
"50 SW 10th St, Miami, FL 33130",9/28/2017,$$,4,Rice House of Kabob,"I came here for lunch and upon entering there is a large menu behind the cashiers with ample choices for vegans, meat & chicken lovers.  I ordered a chicken wrap which was prepared fresh ( $9) and was more than enough protein and veggies for lunch. They provide a white dressing which was very tasty which I poured on my wrap.. delish! Also, they offer a ""box lunch"" which includes rice & beans & your choice of protein for $9.  They sell soft drinks & water to ease it all down. Great spot to grab a tasty but quick lunch!"
"50 SW 10th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/1/2018,$$,5,Rice House of Kabob,"Our company ordered catering for about 30 people for 3 events last month. Our staff loved the food... Every last bit was enjoyed and everyone had rave reviews after each event. It was great that the combination of food had something for everyone, whether omnivore or vegan! It was much preferred over the usual sandwiches we typically cater. The ordering process was very easy as well. The staff helped us figure out exactly what we needed and how much. Overall it was a great experience, and we would definitely order again."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/23/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Finally a new fun vegan spot to dine at!! The vibe is super chill and fun. The food is AMAZING!!! The owner Janette is so sweet and passionate. Can't wait to come back and try more off the menu.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Normally ""Vegan"" is code for ""Taste like shoes leather"", but not at GLAM.  Chef Todd is a Miami legend, all his spots are on point and his food is ridiculous.  This dude beat the breaks off Bobby Flay, and he does the same to these vegetables.  Its 100 degrees out and I'm chugging this carrot soup like Ive been in desert or something.  This guy has me eating cashew cheese on the reg now.  And don't even get me started with these jackfruit dishes homie.  Can't give this place enough stars.  And tell them Miguel sent you... they don;t know me, but its nice to get the name out there you know."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/8/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Soooooo good!!!!! I'm vegan and in love. Amazing food in a nice little place. Miami needs more vegan restaurants and more vegan restaurants like Glam. Would rate it 6 stars if I could.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"great food great owner, don't need to be a vegan to enjoy. definitely recommend the risotto, or ""sausage"" and pepper flatbread"
"215 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33128",9/25/2013,$,5,Guayabitas Eatery,"GO HERE NOW! I promise you, you won't regret it. Its like your stepping into a cute little oasis from one of those unique shows on the cooking channel. Just what downtown needed! Support local products, teas, and bakers. EVERYTHING in their menu is delicious!!! Only wished they had more vegan and gluten free options and desserts. But its ok because their food is so good and refreshing. Not heavy or greasy like everything in the city surrounding it. The best part is their costumer service! The owners are extremely nice and the ambiance/energy makes you want to stay forever. ,The chocolate chip cookie&veggi wrap -must haves"
"11327 South Dixie Hwy, Pinecrest, FL 33156",7/20/2018,$$,3,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,"I liked that this place offered a lot of veggie options for vegans/vegetarians, but I'm not sure that I would go here again because the menu is (understandably) catered to a meat loving crowd. ,I ordered the cold spicy tofu and kimchi as starters. The topping on the tofu had a nice crunch to it and was the best thing I had that night. The kimchi tasted like kimchi you can buy in jar from a grocery store. It was sour (which is okay and preferred), but lacked the true color and taste of the red paper paste that you get from fresh kimchi.,I also ordered the spinach and garlic pouch and the mushroom pouch to put on the grill. I could barely taste the garlic in the spinach and the mushrooms just tasted like boiled mushrooms. ,I'm not going to give this place a one-star rating because their veggies are subpar. I knew what I was getting into and enjoyed the selection they offer for non-meat eaters. Not sure how much the restaurant can change the menu because it is a chain, but better veggie sides and preparation would make this place more enjoyable."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/27/2018,$$,5,Doraku Sushi,I love Doraku!! I come here a lot and it's always delicious. The brussel sprouts and crispy bok choy are my favorite along with the veggie fried rice. Vegan friendly. Excellent happy hour specials. The service can sometimes be slow but they recently got a new manager named Edmundo who seems to be improving the service a lot. I highly recommend this place!
"2721 NW 79th Ave, Doral, FL 33122",4/22/2017,$,5,Central Park Food Station,This small and cozy place is amazing. You have variety from vegan dishes to traditional Venezuelan ones. I came here for lunch while working in Doral & always brought my co workers along. I will always return.
"7991 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",3/29/2018,$$,4,Tropical Chinese Restaurant,"Excellent food and excellent dim sum. A bit pricey, but you're getting great flavor and good service. Very attractive interior. Shrimp dumplings here are my favorite and were a go to of mine. Plum wine here is also delicious. Since going vegan their tofu dishes have been life savers; black bean tofu is where it's at!"
"7991 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",1/28/2018,$$,3,Tropical Chinese Restaurant,"Not the best dim sum place in Miami but not the worst either. If you're the kind of person that cares more about the look of a restaurant than actual food quality, this place is for you. The bright side: decor is pretty cute, and the prices are also reasonable. The service is also nice and extremely attentive. The downside: the food is mediocre, is under-seasoned and probably only tastes good when you've had one too many lychee martinis. All our food was bland and left me yearning for better dim sum I've had in the past. The dim sum menu is pretty small and lacks variety. Kon Chau which is only a few minutes away is extremely superior in both taste and authenticity. This is a dim sum spot you go to when you're on a date and the ambiance is more important than the food. There are a disappointing amount of vegetarian dim sum options, so vegans or meat-eaters on meatless Mondays should avoid this place."
"8347 NW 36th St, Doral, FL 33166",9/10/2017,$$,5,Marfil Bistro,"We came here for the first time, our waiter was very polite and accommodating. We are vegan, so I asked the waiter if I could order a vegetable pasta, he said he would check with the chef. When he returned he said the chef will make anything you want! He told me to choose whatever pasta, vegetables, and sauce I wanted. I was just very basic because I didn't want to be demanding, so I asked for linguine with mushrooms, tomatoes, and red tomato sauce. When I got my food the chef added zucchini, asparagus and other vegetables! Best vegetable pasta I have had, very flavorful! The chef was amazing, not only did he make something that was not on the menu, but during our meal, he came out to greet us and made sure everything was ok with what we ordered! Excellent customer service! I wasn't expecting them to do this for me, because I usually get turned down at restaurants and just end up ordering a salad. This is my first yelp review and I just want to say thank you very much! I live in Hawaii but come to Miami a few times a year, when I'm here this will be my go to place!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/28/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Woah woah woah! Everything was seriously delicious! We had the Pear Flatbread, the Mushroom Risotto, the soup of the day which was mushroom, and the Matcha Pudding! I have to say I don't know what I liked most. Everything was mouthwatering. My fiancé and I fought for the matcha pudding. Whoever gives this place a bad review is dead wrong, and if non vegans give this place a bad review they need to go to a non vegan restaurant. The cashew cheese was spectacular and we are really happy we found this spot. Full vegans are scarce in this city."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/16/2018,$$,3,GLAM Vegan,"My friend came to visit me and we decided to give this place a try. I ordered the risotto, which was extremely bland, and my friend got the burger. I give the burger a solid three stars because it was more flavorful than my risotto, but it was still nothing that would make you come back again. The beverage menu is extensive, however most of the drinks contain alcohol. If you don't drink or are underage, expect to only get water. I asked the cashier if they had Coke products or any soda and she gave me a funny look before telling me they did not.  This place is a little pretentious and  overpriced.  However, this was my first time eating at a vegan restaurant so perhaps I should have had different expectations coming here."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We are vegan and tried this restaurant for the first time. Vegan restaurants are more common now, but we can always use more! Great clean restaurant. Love the fact that you can get filtered water (sparkling, cold, and ambient temp) at no additional cost. Menu items all sound delicious and reasonable in price. We are used to Miami Beach prices, so these are 20-30% lower. We ordered 4 dishes to try a variety of items. Chilled Kelp Noodles, SO much taste in a small bowl and very fresh. Loved the colors of the dish also. Roasted Mushroom Flatbread. Wow, that was a great bust of flavors. Very succulent and adding the thyme to the dish made this the best dish we tried here today. Great presentation of the dish! Fava Bean Puree Toast, was served on Zak's multi-grain bread (pretty sure). Good dish with good taste and good look, but a little bit boring compared to the other dishes we tried. Spaghetti & Meatless Balls, we got this with pasta noodles, but gluten free and zucchini noodles also available. The tomato sauce was definitely homemade and it was excellent. The meatless balls were very good and overall the dish was really great (and messy, lol). Very satisfying dish that meat eaters would like also.,Overall, great place with excellent dishes that all seem to be made in the restaurant from scratch, which is very impressive. Everything was $44 with tax and tips and that was very reasonable. We will be back many times again. Thanks for saving the animals. Every little step counts!,EDIT 1/24/18. Tried the new BBQ burger. A bit too heavy and dense for our taste. Tastes mostly like rice and beet. The slaw that came with the burger was great though."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/3/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My Favorite Vegan place!! I get the meatless spaghetti with zucchini noodle, soup is amazing (daily) The mushroom flatbread .. YUM! Watermelon poke Yum!! I love the vibe here too. Very nice and friendly staffs. great price point! Very clean , comfortable.

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"If you are vegetarian, vegan or simply want to try something new run, run, run to this place.  I can't think of another word that describes the restaurant better than the name they chose for it.  Everything here works and works well:  the food, the ambiance, the music (love that fantabulous early 80's new wave stuff) and the decor.  I wanted to try everything at once of course and here's how it went:  1.gazpacho:  loved every drop of it, not too acidic not too watery, just right 2. jackfruit taco:  now here's something you don't see or taste every day!  it's certainly a good combination  3. pear flatbread:  I told the waitress that this made me want to do the wave or a private cheer...how they were able to get this that good without cheese is beyond me  4.avacado miso toast:  make sure you take this on.  it's a sampling of flavours that will have you wanting to order it again. 5. green tea pot de creme:  I gave this the Charlie Manson crazy good award.  Passion fruit is the topping and coconut is the base, everything else in there was meant to be there and your taste buds will certainly agree.  It's the number one selling dessert and it's candy to the eyes and palate.  Slap me two times to get me out of the food induced ecstasy that just happened here.  Open another store in Doral now!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/3/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Okay, so I knew this place had good reviews, but this isn't typical the food I go for when I go to eat at a vegan restaurant. However, this place did really surprise me and I was very satisfied. The flatbreads are so good and filling! Desserts are pretty tasty (Get the Matcha Pot de Creme and Choco-Avocado desserts!), the truffles remind me of Lara bars, and I didn't get to try the Ube pie. I really like the decor and atmosphere and the location of Midtown. I would suggest visiting here early and avoiding popular meal times since seating can be limited and some items may be unavailable. I would visit here again!"

I tried a few things, had some amazing saki sangria and tried several truffles. Everything was phenomenal. I can't wait to come back."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Miami Midtown first vegan restaurant is now open in heart of Midtown (4 Midtown Building).   The menu selection has a good variety.  The Jackfuit Taco was juicy.  I love flatbreads and the flavor of their Pear Flatbread was equal or better than one made with real cheese.  Awesome they serve beer and wine along with the traditional juices.   The deserts look and taste yummy.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We ordered about 10 different dishes and were not disappointed with a single one. Definitely try the watermelon poke, crazy good flavor! The dishes are visually appealing and mouthwateringly delicious. Whether you're a vegan or not, the food here is absolutely fantastic! We'll be back! Oh, and the desserts....irresistible!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/3/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Some of the best vegan food in miami!! Probably one of my favorites so far!! We are on our way as we speak!!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/2/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I wish I could show you pics of the food but... too late, we got busy fast and ate it all.  Vegans- vegetarians check this place out!  Interesting menu (not the same ole vegan fare), great flavors and presentation not to mention a friendly and very efficient staff.  Must try the Pear Flatbread and Farm Salad.  Also two thumbs up for the Chilled Kelp Noodles.  We can't wait to return."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/21/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,I am not a vegan but everything was great! The staff was amazing and extremely helpful. Came on my lunch break and the service was quick. I had a cup of the soup of the day and some noodles from their snack section. I am glad i decided to try this place out even if it was out of my comfort zone. I will definetly be coming back ! I loved it !
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/15/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,The best vegan I have had. Very nice and courteous staff. I'm happy this restaurant is in my neighborhood. Must try the mushrooms bisque.

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Great food and friendly staff.  I bit pricey, but it's worth it because of the location and the quality of the food.  The flatbreads are incredible, and so is the BBQ burger- all vegan!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/6/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"A treasure to behold and a genuine oasis for Vegans of all stripes.  Such an orderly, creative, and well-run establishment that serves consistently exquisite vegan dishes.  Upon arrival, the clean aesthetic was well-received and the attention to detail/customer service was extraordinary.  We ordered and were directed towards a premium water filter machine that offers still and sparkling water (free of charge!).  After sitting down we didn't wait but 5 minutes before our first dish arrived - an avocado toast plate that was thoroughly prepared and instantaneously devoured.  Precisely at the moment when we were ready for round 2 - an amazingly abundant kale salad dish arrived with the perfect balance of dressing/oil and fresh, unscathed vegetation.  Thinking it couldn't get any better - we were then blessed with one of the most enjoyable flatbreads we've ever tasted.  The entire menu is vegan - and the GLAM stands for ""Green Living Animals Matter"" -- and indeed this establishment gets a Massive Salute for its recognition of Universal Rights properly applied to include animals in the pantheon of natural and cosmic law.  This one was one of the most memorable vegan experiences we've ever had - and we can only hope that GLAM serves as a blueprint for vegan eateries to replicate moving forward.  Zero infractions were issued and the temptation to genuflect upon exiting the restaurant was decisively strong, but alas, was resisted. ,Vegan Level: 1,000,000,Breatharian Ascension Potentiality:  Imminent"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Thankfully, the word ""vegan"" is slowly not being viewed as a curse word in American society. Places like this help people understand that healthy, plant-based food can taste great! Vegan or not, you need to try this restaurant."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/5/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Friendly service, pleasant atmosphere and excellent food. Someone has clearly but much thought and love into creating creative and healthy dishes here. The mushroom flatbread was excellent as were the zucchini noodles with pesto. Very flavorful and certainly a place to take non vegans as well."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/20/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious! I was skeptical about the food because it's vegan but the spaghetti and ""meat"" balls are to die for  very well done- now they need to turn that meatball into a vegan burger and fries lol"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/18/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Five stars for the owner standing up for herself and her business. Great food, great service, great prices. Anyone who has negative things to say about this place should keep their mouth shut. Thankful for a place like this. Without GLAM I don't think I could have taken the step from being vegetarian to vegan. Thank you GLAM and thank you Janette!"

The Risotto is fantastic, definitely a highlight! The menu is really well rounded. I feel like there is truly something for everyone."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/18/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Food here is amazing, the service also. I love coming here all the time. Their recipes are out of this world, best of all is that is vegan"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Love this place. Burger is amazing-great addition!!! Pizzas are fantastic though recently they have been baked less--best when crust is charred, ask for that. Chocolate pudding is delish. Recently changed their green ice tea and I no longer like it. This place is a fantastic addition to the vegan Miami scene!!!!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/5/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Fast service but food that didn't taste ""fast"". I got the Farro Risotto and it tasted just like non-vegan risotto (unless my tastes have changed that much since going vegan). The atmosphere is nice and very relaxing and modern. Just visiting Miami but hoping to come back here next time I'm in town."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/8/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I am NOT a vegan but I love to try different foods. So, tried it and was very pleased and happy I did. The food was amazing. The service is outstanding and the environment of this new place is very cozzy and welcoming. Please try it. It's vegalicious!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/6/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Amazing food!! I love that they have vegan options. The farm salad has cashew dressing that's so good! And the white bean hummus is delicious! My dad had the spaghetti and meatless balls and says that it is the first time he has EVER had a pasta sauce from a restaurant that tastes fresh and tastes good!! So happy about that he's tough to please so this place gets five Stars!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/29/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is amazing! Very affordable vegan food, and a great place for those looking for the ""real"" meat-like taste experience. I would recommend the ""sausage and peppers"" flatbread, which tasted better than the real thing! For dessert we really enjoyed the matcha mousse with passion fruit seeds. Amazing place, kudos to the chef. We will definitely be coming back!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Kind staff, fun decor, and delicious, innovative vegan food! I got the pear pizza, and I do not know if I have ever had vegan cheese that authentic and delicious. Keep up the good work!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/27/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I am not vegan and this is my favorite place to eat! Everything I've had on the menu has been incredible. Jackfruit Tacos and the Pear Flatbread are my personal favorites. Staff is great, prices are extremely reasonable, smoothies are massive. Definitely worth trying!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/21/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,This place is HEAVEN even when you're not vegan. I'm not and I keep coming back because they have the best Gazpacho (must try) and hummus I've ever had. But really everything on the menu has been impressive. One of my favs in Midtown for sure!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/20/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My first Vegan experience and I'm in HEAVEN!!! I was always skeptical about Vegan food, I assumed bland, veggies and salad... but now way all was so savory, delish plates! I was so wronggggg!!! I am coming back for sure. The atmosphere has such a great vibe, very modern, amazing employees, great service."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,I am not vegan and I had a great experience! I had the Chana masala and the matcha passion fruit dessert. They tasted delicious and I felt definitely satisfied afterwards.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/19/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Great place and loved the service. We ordered the chana masala and the risotto, both were very good! I feel this would be a great place to take your non vegan friends as they will probably be satisfied with anything they order.,The atmosphere was good and we didnt have to wait too much (although we went for lunch on a Saturday).,The date balls were pretty good too! Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/29/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Everyone has that one vegan friend who swears they've found a restaurant with food meat eaters will truly enjoy, that is falvorful and filling, and that won't break your budget. Normally, I inwardly groan and begrudgingly agree to tag along -- but expect to pay premium price to go home hungry. Not so with Glam! I was blown away by this counter-style restaruant's delightful menu: Chana masala, flatbreads with ""ricotta"" cheese, miso avocado toast, spaghetti and ""meatballs,"" and many other mouthwatering options for both veggie and meat lovers alike. Kid you not, we tried almost everything on the menu because none of us could decide what we wanted, and absolutely every dish was bursting with flavor. Portions are massive and well priced for such a delicious and wholesome meal. The only reason I'm not giving Glam five stars is an entirely personal preference: I wish ther were servers. With food this good, I think the traditional service atmosphere would add a little something extra."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/4/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I want to start by saying I am not a vegan but I do enjoy vegan and vegetarian meals every so often. The employees are nice but way too slow. The sangria was pretty horrible,it reminded me of Minute Maid fruit punch juice  (pass me a cup of water please). ,My favs:,Ube pie (Who needs sweet potato pie) ,Roasted Mushroom flat bread (Bye bye mushroom pizza),Sausage pepper flat bread (Who needs veggie pizza?),Watermelon poke (Who needs tuna?),My number 1 item is the Al pastor taco (to die for!)they create a shredded beef texture by using jackfruit. It's a little spicy and pricey because it's 7$ per taco. But it's a must! ,My least favorite was the (""Lean Green"") pesto zucchini because it's cold and doesn't have enough of a pesto flavor.  The meatless meatball spaghetti was also my least favorite because the after test reminded me of the purple jelly bean and that no one wants to eat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/1/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,First time visiting GLAM and it was great! My boyfriend and I are new to vegan restaurants and were pleasantly surprised. The spaghetti and meatless balls was delicious and so was the mushroom flatbread. Will be visiting again!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Great vegan resturant for non-vegans. Very budget friendly. Try the Rissoto it is very creamy and good. The atmosphere is chill. Great music playing and never was crowed the times I have gone there. Also the truffles are to die for. Also I meet the owner she is very friendly and will help you.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,This is one of the best vegan places I've visited ... is kind of self serve service super casual and the food is simply delicious !!! My fav are the jackfruit taco  and the spaghetti and meatballs (all vegan )
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Went here for lunch the other day with my friend. We got the avocado toast which was delicious! I have to give light to their pear flatbread though. This is one the best dishes i have ever had in my life! I am now craving it every meal!! Great atmosphere and food comes quickly. Great experience and even better food. I'm not even vegan, but this place is amazing!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/31/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This Vegan restaurant is amazing! The spaghetti and meatless balls was sooo yummy, vegan cheese platter delicious (as a cheese lover it was a great substitute) and the tres leches had me wondering how in the world it was dairy free! Sooooo good! You must check it out!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/11/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I cannot stress how much i love this place! I eat here every week. The menu is phenomenal. I am a huge fan of the cauliflower risotto, the falafel meat ball and spaghetti, and all the flat breads. You feel good after eating here. Literally I want to go full on vegan because of this restaurant!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Holy moly guacamole!!!!!!! This. Place. Is. AWESOME-SAUCE!!!!!! Vegan or no vegan, GO HERE AND EAT YOUR HEART OUT!!!!! Most delish vegan restaurant I have been at. This is a must visit when visiting Miami!!!!!!!!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/27/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Went there Monday for lunch and I gotta say the food is spectacular. We ordered the ""sausage"" flatbread and the risotto and they were both delicious. (Especially the risotto.) It's sort of a self-serve spot when it comes to the water and cutlery which is weird because it doesn't really go with the vibe. The decor, cutlery and vibe seems expensive and up-scale but it's sort of a fast-dining kinda thing. We spoke to one of the servers /bussers that day. A young man. We talked about vegan diet and how to make the transition right - he was nice and knowledgeable and it's cool to have staff who knows about vegan food and is vegan themselves. Makes the whole thing stay true to the concept. Will be returning here for food. It's a cool spot and the only vegan one midtown."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/12/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Very nice selection of vegan dishes. Food was flavorful - watermelon ceviche awesome as well as poke dish.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/27/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I don't usually like vegan stuff, but the food was great. People serving, nice and warm. Cool place. Only thing I didn't like is the system the created for getting your food. I'd much rather the old fashion waiter or take your food yourself...On this place you buy at the counter and they bring your food. But not the forks and knives...it's alright tough."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/17/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food here was much better than expected. Flavorful. This is an excellent spot to show your Omnivore friends that vegan cuisine is not just sticks and twigs. The average meal price is about 10-15$ person. Not too expensive and reasonable for the location. Staff is super friendly and presentable. They make you feel at home even when you're a vegan noob that knows nothing yet. No spots on the silverware or glasses, either so you know you're eatin' fancy-like.,If I'm ever in Miami again, will certainly visit."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/23/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My boyfriend and I had been meaning to try this vegan spot for quite some time. We are so happy that we passed by. All the food was very flavorful and satisfying. We will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. My favorites were the mushroom bisque, spaghetti and ""meat balls"", and the purple sweet potato pie. My only complaint was the lady at the front register was not very welcoming. I went to get a menu and she put her hand over it not letting me get a menu to see for myself. Our waiter however, was super friendly so that made up for it. Overall, I definitely recommend if you are looking for something vegan and delicious."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We've been waiting for this place to open and came in on opening day. Everything is amazing! We had several dishes and they were all delicious. We are not vegan, we just like food food and we enjoyed everything. Some highlights were the jack fruit taco, the ginger carrot soup and the flat bread. The desserts were awesome as well, the matcha pot de creme was to die for!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is my favorite vegan restaurant by far. The customer service is great and the environment is hip. I love their daily soups, plates and desserts. You can eat a lot here without feeling bloated. They do not over seasoned the meals, and they keep a very clean area. If you are looking for a great flat lay food option, then this is your place. The vibe is great to even study there and grab a few snacks. It is great for big groups and they have an outside seating area. I am a returning customer."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Finally Miami have a bit of Vegan food to offer. GLAM was diffidently a refreshing surprise!! The food is fresh, elegant and the prices are really affordable. My wife and I started with the gazpacho soup- that had a great flavor, nothing special there but tasty, then we took the kelp noodles that were with a great texture and flavors. For mains we took the Masala chickpeas and the Farro mushrooms risotto. The risotto was Amazing!! A dish to come back for, the Masala was good but Indian restaurants make it better.,All in all I am very happy with this place, I'll be back for sure. Hope more Vegan places like that will pop up in Miami ."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/24/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Great to have a new vegan restaurant in the area.  I certainly love the Jack Fruit Tacos.   Very nice to sit on the sidewalk out front.  Only negative was that I felt they could use a bit more expansive menu.  Many of the items are things I make at home.  But none the less, yummy."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/11/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Carnivores listen up -- there's a new vegan spot in Midtown that will even turn the most meat loving diners into converts. Well, at least for their meal. Called GLAM -- short for green living animals matter -- it's a vegan spot featuring world inspired cuisine by chef Todd Erickson of Huahua's and Haven fame and we got a first look.,The fast-casual menu is divided into multiple sections depending on your mood and hunger. Smaller snacks include dishes like a Watermelon Poke tossed in konbu, lotus, sesame, sweet tamari, nori and a yuzu vinaigrette or the chilled Kelp Noodles made with ginger, almond, coconut, siracha, scallion, daikon and basil. Other unique items like the Jackfruit ""Al Pastor"" Tacos and Cashew Cheese Platter can also be found, and the fact that they don't have any animal product in them will almost come as a surprise.,Larger options include a variety of flatbreads, with our favorite being the Sausage and Pepper that is topped with a grain-based Italian ""sausage"", charred peppers, marinara, arugula and basil. Of course, you'd be remiss to not try one of GLAM's toast offerings with the classic Avocado Toast topped with orange and tajin being as beautiful as it was delicious. For those looking for a hearty dish, the chickpea-based Chana Masala with garam masala, mango, tomato chutney, papadum, and quinoa will satisfy any hunger pang.,Make sure not to overlook dessert, because even though they are missing dairy they are still tasty and cravable. Our favorites were the Matcha Tea Pots de Crème with mango, passdonfuit and coconut and the avocado based Choco-Cado Mousse made with dark chocolate, avocado, agave and coconut. Wash the whole meal back with a Sake-Rose Sangria filled with pear, pineapple and berry for a refreshing treat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/11/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I had the BBQ Burger with the coleslaw. The burger was outstanding and this was the first coleslaw I have ever liked. The service was great as well fast and friendly. I loved the decor of the restaurant very simple but modern. The food is a little pricey, but what vegan restaurant isn't. If I'm ever in the area I will definitely return. Beefless meatballs next"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/30/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is the bombbb! One of my favorite vegan spots. Amazing quality and big portions (bowls and flatbreads). Honestly everything on the menu is amazing & if you think otherwise let them know after first bite and they are more than please to accommodate. They have recently added menu options which make me very happy and have also upped the price a bit, but for what they serve it is still worth every penny. You can really taste all the love put into these recipes. ,This is they're BBQ burger *spicy*"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I got the spaghetti and meatless balls with zucchini noodles and ended the meal with the matcha custard. It was very tasty to my surprise and I left feeling great. I would definitely recommend Glam Vegan to anyone looking for tasty, healthy options!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious, affordable vegan food. Granted, Miami has lots of these options (maybe not as much on the affordable side), but GLAM is one of the better ones. The name pretty much warrants an eye-roll (sometimes acronyms just aren't meant to be and seem way too forced), but get past that and you've got delicious food at decent prices. ,Everyone there is friendly and even checked up on us after we had started eating (how many fast casual places do that??). The food was flavored great and wasn't too over the top like some vegan places are when trying to appeal to the omnivores of the human race. ,Give this place a try!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious vegan food! Must try! The vegan risoto and pizza are super yummy. only thing? I wish the music they play at the restaurant goes with the ""vibe"". Organic, green living,vegan animal matter style ;) the selection playing was very miami (not in a good way)! it's just a little ""but"". it's perfection!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Nice casual place to enjoy vegans meals. Very simple menu and the ambiance is trendy. My girlfriend and I shared the spaghetti and grain ball dish. Pasta was good not too salty but the meatless meatball has a bitterness after bite to it. Kelp noodles has a nice crunch to it with awesome flavors. But our favorite one was the lean and green salad. The zucchini noodles along with a mixture of lemon oregano, broccoli, and avocado was amazing. Definitely recommend it!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Wow, amazing vegan place! I had the risotto and my wife had the channa masalla and both dishes were amazing.

The country could use it"

I wish I could give GLAM more than 5 stars. This restaurant is easily the best vegan restaurant I've tried in Miami. Don't worry meat eaters, you'll love it too.,I highly recommend the cashew cheese platter for an appetizer, any of the flatbreads (my favorites are the pear flatbread and the mushroom one) or mushroom risotto as an entree, and the matcha tea custard or truffles for dessert. ,Bravo, GLAM. Consider me your newest regular."

I had the BBQ burger and it was drenched in super sweet sauce. The patty was compressed brown rice and beet ""blood"". My son has spaghetti and compressed brown rice meatballs. MEH."

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/28/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Great vegan food - we had spaghetti, gazpacho and matcha passion fruit dessert and we loved everything."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/16/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"GLAM - another vegan restaurant that doesn't taste like i.  This place does a great job of being quick, affordable, and delicious.  Combined that Big 3 with being healthy and feeling great leaving, this place is a regular go-to, especially at lunch.  Sit outside with a laptop and shades and get the burger.  The vegan barbecue really is tasty, and this is coming from someone from Memphis, TN.  If you're in the midtown area, I highly recommend."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/13/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Such a cute concept! I love this place. I tried a TON of food and still only spent $30. Everything was amazing and worth every single dollar spent. For non-vegans, the flavors alone will keep you coming back. A lovely restaurant with attentive and kind staff."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"What I love about this place is that they do not use single use plastic, they are super green and promote community unity. Great spot for lunch, and honestly, you can't even tell the food is vegan. It's amazing, filling, and tasty!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/6/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is one of the best Vegan spots in town. ,Food: We had the Lean & Green zucchini noodle salad, chana masala and a date ball for desert - all were fresh and delicious, and prices were very reasonable for the quality. ,Service: Very friendly. You walk up and order from a counter, but they do have servers who bring your food and bussers to clear tables. ,Atmosphere: Cozy inside, but we sat outdoors at one of the tables since we had our dog. ,Parking: Pretty easy since it's midtown and there is street parking as well as garage parking available. ,We will definitely be back!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"So glad GLAM has opened in Midtown! We need more vegan restaurants like this in Miami. I went with a couple friends, many of which aren't vegetarian or vegan, and everyone loved it.,It's a small venue with a trendy modern ambience. The staff is very friendly and helpful with providing suggestions of their best dishes. The portions are surprisingly well sized, compared to other trendy vegan places. ,The farro risotto was so delicious - it's so creamy, you'll be surprised there's no dairy in it. Also a hit is the pesto zucchini noodles dish. The pesto is clearly house-made - sooo fresh. Definitely treat yourself to a vegan truffle after your meal. The cacao and almond one is basically like a healthy brownie bite. ,The restaurant is a little bit on the pricey side, but I understand that food with specialty ingredients like this costs more than your average restaurant. Will be returning to try more off their menu!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Pros: If you are looking for light, healthy, delicious vegan options, this is the place for you! I was really craving a fresh dish and GLAM vegan hit the spot. I ordered the white bean soup and the Lean and Green bowl, both surpassed expectation. I plan on trying everything on the menu. All selections were mouth watering, any veggie lover would agree. Definitely RD approved!,Cons: The to-go utensils were made of woody material, at first sight I thought: Wow, chic! Hooray, more sustainable than plastic! However, I was sorely mistaken, it was difficult eating with the super cute utensils, the spoon was too shallow for soup, the fork was awkward. Obviously nitpicking here! Try this place out!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/20/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"As someone who became vegan just 4 months ago, coming to GLAM Vegan was a real treat. My boyfriend and I chose this spot after spending a Saturday afternoon at the Frost museum. It was close by, casual, and we don't have many vegan options in Kendall, where we live. ,Parking was was easy. We paralleled parked at a meter relatively close by. The area is cute enough that I didn't mind the short trek to GLAM. ,The restaurant is more of the bistro type. You order first at the register, then they assign you a number. You also pick up your cutlery, linen napkins, and your choice of sparkling water or water in a glass. Finding a table was easy which I was happy about. It's considerably small. We decided we'd sit outdoors because all the tables were packed and the weather was beautiful anyway. ,We ordered the cashew cheese plate to start, along with my order of mushroom risotto and my boyfriends pepper flatbread. To finish we chose the ube pie. We took home an order of the buffalo cauliflower. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the cheese plate, mushroom risotto, and the buffalo cauliflower. ,The service was great as well. Very friendly staff that make you feel at ease walking in. They're attentive and it makes just that more appealing. ,Although it's a bit far, I'd definitely come back and recommend it to all my vegan and non vegan friends alike."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/18/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My favorite vegan restaurant in the city, for sure! I just went once, but I have never tried any healthy vegan food with so much taste and textures! I am pretty sure I am coming back soon. ,Although the location and the decoration compensate the prices, it could be a little bit less, and so more people would go more often, just like me.,I had the zucchini spaghetti with meat balls; even though I am not a fan of tomato sauce, it was the best ever! My boyfriend had the favo risotto and it was pretty good too! I wish I could had the truffle and the pie, but maybe next time... I was really satisfied with everything."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/23/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Pretty delicious food coming out of this vegan restaurant. With indoor and outdoor seating available, you order your food at the front, receive a numbered block for your table and take a seat, food is brought out for you. There is a decent selection to choose from for Starters, main entrees, smoothies and desserts- menu can be found online. For a Starter, I ordered the Jack Fruit Taco Al Pastor ($7), it's a single soft tortilla with a generous portion of the bbq jackfruit, I had to eat a bit of it with a fork to be able to fold and eat it like a taco which is perfectly fine! Without the tortilla and toppings it is pretty acidic tasting, but once you eat everything with the salsa, and crema together it's very well balanced and delicious! I ordered the Farro Risotto ($15), was a generous portion of risotto, with plenty of mushrooms, the dish was pretty heavy, but I enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. For dessert, we had the Choco-cado Mousse (chocolate-avocado mousse topped with fresh berries and shredded coconut), and a Matcha Tea Custard (matcha custard topped with chopped mango, and passion fruit- with seeds). The Matcha custard was nice and creamy, and didn't have a heavy matcha taste- which I like. The custard to fruit ratio was a little off, I wish there was a tad more fruit to get enough fruit in each bite. I would recommend this place"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/9/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Totally a fan of Glam. The decor alone had me at hello! I loved the concept of vegan being glamorous which put a twist on it not seeming so boring. My family and I almost ordered everything on the menu. We ordered the following:,---Watermelon Poke- what a great take on Tuna Poke. Was very refreshing and light,--Black bean soup- ,--Pear flatbread- was so good. The cashew ricotta was really good. Totally didn't miss the cheese,--Sausage & pepper flatbread- All I have to say is that it really tasted like sausage and I don't eat the real thing. ,--Avocado Miso Toast-I didn't try this but my brother said it was really good,--Spaghetti and  Meatless balls- The noodles was really good along with the sauce. My daughter like this dish even though she complained about eating it. The meatless ball was was ok I thought.,--Chana Masala-this dish is a bit spicy and has a good Indian flavor of curry in it. The quinoa was tasteless.,--Lean & Green- was flavorful with the lemon-basil pesto. It threw me off that it was cold noodles. I didn't pay attention to the menu.,--Farro Risotto-- wow this tasted just like mac & cheese. Loved this dish,We literally had a feast and tried a bit of everything. I liked Glam but I'm not sure if it would be my go-to vegan restaurant. It was great to try but maybe not to have often. Definitely a great place to bring first timers to try vegan food."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/3/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Went outside my usual food zone to try GLAM Vegan on Saturday evening. I ordered the Gazpacho and Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" as appetizers, the Farro Risotto as my entree, and an Almond Coconut Truffle for dessert.,Quality,Nothing about my visit to GLAM Vegan changed my attitude towards being an omnivore. However, I was impressed with the creativity that comes with making different food choice selections. With an open-mind I ordered several different items from the menu with varying levels of comfort. I started with the Gazpacho, which was a solid bowl of soup. With chunks of tomato and cucumber, the tomato based soup with cilantro, sherry vinegar, and breadcrumbs was a good start. Next came the Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" and I must admit I was worried about seeing quotation marks around food items on the menu. The dish was sliced jackfruit in bbq sauce served with pineapple, red cabbage, tomatillo salsa, and tofu cream. It was a unique and tasty combination of flavors that mixed spicy and sweet. Even though it was clearly not shredded pork, the jackfruit provided a good substitute that did not make me miss the meat. The Farro Risotto was not a big stretch from the norm, a mushroom ragout, fennel, white wine, and cashew cream. The farro was cooked perfectly, the mushrooms were very flavorful, and the sauce was excellent. Now I was hoping for a piece of the Ube Pie, but apparently I was too late, so I settled for a Almond Coconut Truffle. It was the only flaw in an otherwise delicious meal. I am not a baker so I don't know what sort of substitutions are needed, but it came out very bland and had a grainy texture.,Quantity,Even though it was just an appetizer the Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" was still pretty substantial. The Farro Risotto meanwhile was massive and left me stuffed. ,Value,The menu was a bit expensive, but not as bad as I had expected. With so many people around me choosing vegan and vegetarian lifestyles I am used to seeing their bills be nearly double what I order at restaurants. But considering the amount of food and the quality I was okay paying the slightly higher price.,Ambiance,GLAM Vegan is located in Midtown Miami in a row of stores near the newly built apartment complexes. It is set up in a fast casual style that I am not the biggest fan of. After ordering at the inside counter you get a block and wait for the food to come to you. Inside they had about ten small tables and then a dozen or so outside. The restaurant was packed so outside was the only option for me. I grabbed a seat and almost instantly I started getting devoured by bugs and mosquitos. They did have soul music playing over the speakers outside to help the wait go by faster. Inside the store is very modern and sleek. Stylish design with color coordination and a focus on sustainability, as could be expected. The inside area also was very loud and the seats are tightly arranged.,Crowd,On Saturday evening the restaurant was completely packed. People gathered around outside waiting for people to leave their tables so they could scoop in. While it was clear that the restaurant had reached the vegan community, the delicious food also managed to catch the attention of others. I will say the crowd definitely swung towards the younger end and the outside area was a major attraction because many people had brought their dogs with them.,Service,The staff was absolutely great. The girl behind the counter was helpful and the waiters passing around the food were friendly and efficient. They managed to make jokes and stay positive as they darted back and forth from the kitchen.,Parking,I chose to park in one of the garages in Midtown to avoid the hassle of street parking. They also have valets set up nearby.,Extra,With so many vegetarian and vegan focused restaurants popping up across Miami, I decided to finally check one out. GLAM Vegan turned out to be a great choice as the unique and creative take on food has me really intrigued. While I approach it more as a type of food decision rather than a lifestyle or nutritional choice, I appreciate the time and effort it takes to develop these culinary creations."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Wow! Can I say this place lived up to it's reviews completely!!! I went here for my birthday with a group of 10 people. Half are vegan and the other are not but we're completely willing to try it. We literally made our dishes into tapas trying each other's food and everything was extremely tasty. From the spicy buffalo cauliflower to the watermelon ceviche to the vegan burger my party was totally blown away and had an open mind to try more. We kept on ordering more food because the non vegans loved it so we also tried the risotto mushroom and the spaghetti and meatballs. So good. Props to the owner and the staff. Very welcoming and accommodating! I would definitely come again.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/22/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is incredible! My girlfriend and I shared some Tacos, Spaghetti & Meatballs, and the BBQ Burger! Washed it down with some Pomegranate Kombucha, and finished the meal with some Teuffles. Everything was Vegan, Gluten Free, & DELICIOUS!!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/24/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I went here with my girlfriend for a random lunch date because we've heard nothing but good things about this vegan spot. It didn't disappoint. For a while we've been wanting to check this restaurant out. Appearance was great, the server was very attentive, and food was so good. Just the right amount served to satisfy us without getting too full. We had roasted mushroom flatbread to share, a lean a green cold noodle dish, and i had a bit of my girlfriend's gazpacho. After that, it was time for dessert! Out of the 2 desserts ordered, my favorite was the matcha tea custard. The other dish we ordered was the ube pie, made from sweet potato. It was delicious as well. Next time i want to try the truffles! ,There's so many options for food here i can't wait to try them all"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Another great spot to get your plant based meals! Vegan spots are starting to pop up all over and Glam is a small intimate quick service restaurant that does it very well! The presentations are beautiful and all served on elegant black plates. We had the avocado toast, the risotto, and the ""sausage"" flatbread!  All were excellent! My favorite was the flatbread and the cauliflower imitated the taste of sausage very well! ,The service is great and the entire staff was super friendly and welcoming. They have golden utensils that really pop against the black plates. Great for those instagram pics! ;) They also have a bunch of truffles right at the register that are ginormous and tempting! Smart tactic!  But this time for dessert, we had the matcha pots de creme! Soooo good! If you like creamy matcha, this is a must!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/11/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I could eat here almost everyday if I lived in the area. Vegan food thats yummy and the portions are great. I ordered 2 flat breads. 1 was the pear and the other was ""sausage"". My friend and I split them and they were simply delicious. The decor was casual with a drop of elegance on both the inside and out. I also got the mango apricot tea which comes unsweetened but they will provide you with a side of agave syrup. I was so impressed honestly. I had no idea that I would enjoy eating Vegan food so much but I've been looking for a reason to come into Midtown for lunch for months now and what better time to do it than now. I think next I want to try the spaghetti. At some point I'm planning on making my way through the entire menu. If you want some modern Vegan food that's flavored to perfection please check them out!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/20/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I'm not on the all vegan wagon yet but I do occasionally enjoy a plant-based meal. Vegan restaurants are starting to pop up all over Miami but not all are that good, this one here is one of the very few good ones. Came by today and had the daily soup to start and that is the Tuscan white bean and kale soup which was very delicious. The soup has depth and a creamy consistency that I enjoyed very much and the kale goes perfect with it. ,     Then I went for the spaghetti and meatless balls and that was also very good, to my surprise. The grain bean balls are crunchy on the outside and very flavorful, enough to forget that you are not actually eating meatballs, especially for those in the transition to becoming all vegan, not moi. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the marinara sauce was amazing enough to have without any Parmesan cheese which is a must for me when eating pasta.,     The place looks super clean and organized and they have a station with utensils, glasses, napkins and water...self serve. The service is good considering they only bring food out from the kitchen and pick up anything on the table. I'd love to try the Gaspacho next time because from the photos I've seen, it looks delicious."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/30/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The best VEGAN restaurant in Miami. The food at this place is AMAZING. Also they offer you free water and sparkling water. Prices are very good in compare to other overpriced fancy vegan restaurants. ,If you are a true vegan you will love this place and if you are not a vegan but like to eat clean you will be very surprise by this place. A+"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My best friend and I came here for her birthday and must day I was pleasantly impressed. The place is cute and like the name said ""glam"". Loved the decor but I loved the food even more. Every dish that we had was amazing. The price point was great. I would recommend this to all the vegan divas and divos with excellent taste in food."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Recently been trying to transition from a Vegetarian to Vegan phase, my friends recommended this place and I loved the modern look and feel. Personally sitting outside is better on a nice night. Food was great and different. ,Recommend the BBQ burger."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/15/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Living in Broward has its disadvantages...it doesn't have GLAM!  My friend surprised me with a girls day out for lunch.  She is not Vegan, but she is so supportive and doesn't want me stuck eating a salad and french fries for lunch...so she brought me to Green Living Animals Matter (GLAM).,We walked in and the girl behind the counter was super nice.  She let us know immediately they had some kitchen issues so we were unable to get the jack-fruit tacos or the bisque.  No worries, there was plenty to eat.,Food:  My friend and I shared everything.  We started with the Mushroom Risotto.  YOU MUST have this!  It was amazing.  We also had the pear flatbread.  It was probably my favorite of everything we ate.  It had pears, cashew ""ricotta,"" and red onions with a pesto sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  The Miso Avocado Toast was tasty, but hey everyone can make an avocado toast.  We also had the white bean hummus..not my favorite.  The tahini seemed over powering.  The hummus came with a homemade cracker made from sesame seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds and pumpkin seeds.  AWESOME!  We also had some lattes made with toasted coconut almond milk.  DELISH!,The restaurant is pretty much self service.  You order at the register, get a number and the team brings it to you.  They also have self service water.  You can get sparkling water, flat water or effervescent water.  The silverware is gold and there are no paper napkins.  The seating inside is limited, but they have outside seating as well.  ,Everyone, including the other patrons, were super friendly.  Customers were willing to make suggestions on what to eat.  ,It was nice to go out for a vegan meal that wasn't filled with tofu and salad.  The food was innovative and delicious.  I wish they were closer to my home, as I'd be there daily!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Found Glam on yelp while looking for vegan restaurants while staying in Wynwood. We enjoyed the mushroom risotto & nachos. I definitely recommend this place.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Was in the mood for some vegan food so I stopped by for lunch. ,I ordered the jackfruit taco ""al pastor"" with bbq jackfruit, pineapple, red cabbage,tomatillo salsa, tofu cream and the Lean and green bowl - zucchini noodles, chunky avocado, snow peas, asparagus, broccolini, lemon-basil pesto. ,The jack fruit tacos were extremely delicious and definitely my favorite. Was really impressed how the jackfruit had so much flavor and texture and consistency was like a shredded beef. It has a nice spicy kick to it. Wow! However they are quite pricey. At $7 a piece I could have had 4-5. Do the math $28 for 4 tacos it can get quite pricey. Ouch! ,The zoodle bowl was good, honestly nothing special. I Was expecting the pesto sauce to have that strong savory herbal flavor, it didn't. ,Overall very nice spot, can't wait to try the other dishes."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/12/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I love the concept of GLAM vegan. I've heard so many great things about it that I finally decided to give it a try for myself. The restaurant is very chic, the staff are friendly, and the food is good. ,At the register, they offer samples of their soup of the day. While, I can't remember exactly what sample I had, I wasn't very impressed. The soup was very thick but that was from the excessive amount of flour used to create the consistency. Overall, it lacked flavor and was very bland. Although, I ordered the Mushroom Risotto which was surprisingly pleasant. The risotto was very creamy, flavorful, and filling! ,There are some other items on the menu that I would love to try, so I'll definitely be coming back."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/2/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Loved it here! The mushroom bisque was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed the Hawaiian poke bowl. It was surprisingly close to real poke! Our server was super good looking (please take my number if you're reading this) and very helpful, answered a lot of my companion's questions. They also put the ricotta on the side of his spaghetti upon request which was very nice and considerate. My companion is not vegan and I am, so he wasn't a big fan of the seitan meatballs but I'd run that up to personal taste and not preparation, I thought it was amazing! I loved the vibe there, it was very Miami while still being a bit romantic and classic. I'm hoping to return before leaving the city, absolutely loved it!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/6/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"OMG.. If there were 50 Stars, GLAM Vegan would get all of them!!  3 times over!! ,This little place is so magically delicious!  So much so, I went twice during the same weekend I was down to visit. ,There is a delicious menu with appetizers, main meals and desserts as well as wine!  It doesn't get any better than that.  They even have a cool water machine where you can pick your own water type and fill up a bottle to take to your table.  Still, sparkling, cold or ambient water.. SO COOL!,You walk in and you place your order at the main counter.  You then get an oversized what looks like a Scrabble tile with a number on it to place on your table so they know where to bring your goodies!  ,As I enjoy my dessert first (why wouldn't you - what if something happened to you before your actual meal came?!  Wouldn't you have liked to have began with the sweetest thing??) and it was a Tres Leches yumminess that I wish was bigger! The cake was soft and moist and was topped off with a dollop of this whipped cream that you couldn't tell me was not dairy!  Nom Nom Nommy Nom Nom!  ,Then it was on to the spaghetti and ""meat"" balls.  SO. GOOD!!! Again.. you couldn't tell me they didn't sneak beef up in them meatballs.  The noodles were cooked to al dente perfection and the sauce was seasoned by angels.  So delicious!!,The service was spectacular.  Everyone was kind and sweet and GLAM is now one of my Miami must go to eat places whenever I'm down there.  Whether you are vegan or not.. treat yourself and everyone with you to some yummy good food that is also good FOR you too!!  Thank you, GLAM, for BEING!"

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Glam Vegan definitely lives up to its name. I kind of feel like the vegan food genre gets a horrible rep for itself in that the food has to be boring, the places are decorated blah and nothing is never ever really good. This is totally not the case here!,Located in Midtown, it's got a cute little vibe to it. Has very modern and sophisticated decor, I really loved the gold silverware. Was definitely a nice touch. Water is self serve and the process is simple, you go to the counter, order, they give you a number and bam! You have your food a little later.,My first dish was the watermelon poke which was a great play on tuna poke. Totally admitting, it didn't taste like tuna, the textures of the watermelon gave it a nice bite. I love the lotus and yuzu vinaigrette too. Nice mix of sweet, a little tart.,My meal was the farm salad bowl which I was really nervous about since it was my meal. It was huge, delicious and so much better than I could ever imagine? Who knew cashew ranch could be so delicious!? I could have done without the green beans, but thank god there was avocado! Everything was fresh and delicious, I honestly couldn't ask for more.,Meal came to $21 which overall I don't consider bad for being in Miami and being a speciality type of restaurant. I highly recommend Glam if you're looking for something different, something healthy, and just plain good (for you)."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/21/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is a Gem. The nachos were great. Also, had the buffalo cauliflower bowl. My parents who aren't vegan were pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend this place!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/3/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This was actually our first visit to Glam, but now it definitely became our favorite place in town. As vegans, it is always hard to find a place where we can find veganlicious food, with kid friendly options. The place was clean, charmingly decorated, neat, and very relaxing. The staff was very receptive and kind. My husband had a BBQ Burger, the kids had Nachos to share, and I had a Chana Masala Hot Bowl. Don't forget to have dessert, they all look delicious, we went with the Ube Pie...and O.M.G, I can not describe how delightful it was!,So, I absolutely recommend this place!,Can't wait to come back! ,@harmannylife"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/21/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We have been into our fair share of vegan restaurants in the Washington DC area but this is the best that we have been to untill now. ,Located in midtown miami district,  this place has a cool interior decor (limited indoor seating area). We order their daily soup- gazpacho which was cold but did not lack in flavor  - something that can be said about every dish we had! We tried the mushroom bisque,  mushroom flatbread and farro Risotto topped with shrooms (guess what we are into these days!) ,They have Vero water dispenser which has sparkling water as well. Something new that we haven't seen anywhere else.,Overall, this place is pretty unique, entirely vegan and everyone should definitely try it once when in Miami. We are definitely coming back to Glam Vegan the next tine we are in town!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/2/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"For those who want to explore vegan cuisine, this place is just for you! Located in the up and coming Miami Midtown area, this restaurant serves creative vegan food that truly is delicious, regardless if it was vegan or not. This restaurant is an order and then sit down type of restaurant, which makes it pretty causal and straight forward. Parking availability includes street parking and garage parking, although the latter is more convenient.,Now on to the food: if you think vegan food could not be tasty, this place will prove you wrong! My party ordered a variety of things, my favorites being the Hawaiian poke salad and the pear flatbread! So many great flavors, all of which were very good at substituting what you would think would normally contain meat, like the Jackfruit Tacos and the BBQ burger (which had too much BBQ sauce in my opinion, but of course that is just preference). I also like that there was somewhat a South East Asian flair in their dishes, many of which used ingredients from that area of the world. For dessert, my BF and I took some Ube pie home, as we love Ube (a purple yam that is a staple in Filipino dishes)! However, it did not have the Ube flavor we were looking for, and tasted like the typical sweet potato pie you eat on Thanksgiving, so unfortunately it did not wow us.,Last few things about this place, price range for each dish is from $7 - $20, and prepare to get several dishes since the majority of them are tapas style. Interior design is neat and clean, but there isn't as much seating inside as outside. Service is great too, very friendly staff! Other than that, I'd say if you ever want to dine vegan, then this is the place to visit!"

Adorable cart near the front door with self-serve glasses, bottles for ""water pitchers"", flat water, sparkling water, & gold utensils! It added a nice touch.,At the counter they have a little display case filled with sweets! Pie, cookies & truffles.,The young lady handed us a brunch menu but I was all about those hot entrees! Side note the girls that sat next to us ordered the French toast! Not only did I want to photograph her food, but I wanted to stick my fork in & grab a piece!! It looked scrumptious!!,We ordered pear flatbread, veggie burger with slaw & spaghetti with meatless meatballs. I wasn't going to order a drink but since the sangria sounded so enticing I ordered a glass.  Sangria was a blend of sake, rose', pear & pineapple. I don't mind paying $9 a glass but I did ask if it was a decent size.... to my surprise when it came out it looked like a little shot in my huge glass! ,My husband & I looked at each other & smiled....,When we make sangria or usually get it it's a tall glass! In any case it was delicious. Just wish it was at least half way filled for $9.00. I wouldn't order that again....,Spaghetti dish was out of this world delicious! Portion was perfect. Plated beautifully I would 100% order this over & over! My husbands veggie burger was fantastic! Daughters flat bread was so unique! Every bit of wonderful! When you love & appreciate good food & stumble upon something wonderful you want to make sure people really know about it!!! ,Staff was so attentive & friendly! All smiles! ,We had an amazing experience They even sampled their daily soup which was black bean. Each day they feature a different soup. I really wanted to try a dessert but I was too stuffed lol,Highly recommend this place for everyone not just vegans! ,I came away with one question! When I return do I get what was so absolutely perfect or venture off and try something new ;-)~"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Pretty impressed with Glam. I have to say it's one of our new favorites in the vegan food world. The spaghetti is phenomenal and I was surprised the serving size was pretty substantial which was a definite plus. Not sure what the ""meat""balls are made of but whatever it was- more of that please. We also tried the tres leches and I was surprised to say I think I like it more than it's original dairy sibling. The ube pie is pretty glam for the 'gram and taste nice too by the way. ,Everything that we have tried has been exceptional and definitely has not lacked in flavor. Looking forward to soon returning and trying out the BBQ burger and the risotto!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"FIRE. I had the pesto pear pizza OMG AMAZING. also the tres leches??!?!? HEAVENLY. This place is high on my list of best vegan spots in Miami. ,My friends got the bbq burger I believe and the chickpea masala or something? The Indian dish was great but I personally didn't care much for the bbq burger"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food was so amazing. It is all vegan but it doesn't feel like you're eating vegan in that everything is extremely filling and the textures of the food mimic that of non-vegan food so well (like the ""cheese"" and the ""burger"").,I would 100% recommend the flatbreads and the avocado toast. The pear flatbread is amazing and I will come back to this restaurant just for that dish. Also the jackfruit taco was the best imitation meat I have ever had. I'm not convinced it's not real meat, it's so similar! ;) They also have pretty good sangria and desserts!,This is a casual inside/outside sit down place where you order at the register and then indulge at your table. Everything is eco friendly and absolutely delicious. The wait staff is super friendly too!,I am not a vegan - in fact, I am a meat-eater. But I would eat here more often than not if it were closer to my house. If I was gifted enough to cook this at home myself I would go vegan in a heartbeat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/22/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,Probably my favorite go to vegan restaurant as I've tried many of their dishes. Everything is extremely delicious but I always come back for their purple Ube sweet potato pie which is so yummy. The ambience is great as you can sit inside or out. I prefer outside on days like today we're the music is good and so is the weather.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/20/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Deliciously filling vegan food located in Midtown. I'm not vegan myself but I do enjoy eating vegan dishes on occasion since they always make me feel so light and refreshed. I ordered the Chana Masala dish with chickpeas, mango chutney and quinoa. It came with a big crunchy piece too, not sure what it's called but imagine it being a really crunchy piece of roti. Either way, it was delicious. I didn't find it to be too spicy; however I eat spicy food so much that I probably didn't notice the heat. My friend ordered the zoodle salad with avocado and kale pesto, and the couple bites she generously shared with me were delicious! The kale pesto didn't taste bitter at all! ,For dessert, we ordered the choco-cado mousse and matcha tea custard - YUM! The mouse was very rich in chocolate, topped with pieces of crispy coconut and berries, and didn't taste one bit like avocado! As for the matcha tea custard, the green goodness was topped with passion fruit and mango cream, which made it a little tart but it was juuuust right. I chose to mix the cream on top into the custard itself so I could have a little tartness with each bite. Can't wait to go back!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/29/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"When a friend recommended vegan for a lunch spot my first reaction was... Eh, you can miss me on that one, I'm not a vegan. But I was surprisingly a fan of this feel good healthy lunch option!   The food was FRESh, made in house + most importantly tasty! ,I had a zucchini noodle pesto salad with the Harvest Squash soup of the day which was exceptional! ,The ambiance is intentional, the soundtrack makes you feel as if you are in a trendy yoga studio... which was both relaxing and fun.  ,A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, and this food is worth it."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/5/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I'm not even vegan but came here to meet a vegan friend for brunch.  I was pleasantly surprised. ,I chose the watermelon ceviche and all I can say is WOW.  It's actually supposed to be an appetizer but I had it as my meal.  It filled me up and was SO fresh.  All the flavors came together so well.,I chose the matcha custard with mango and passion fruit for dessert - SO GOOD.  I would come back here just for that dessert.,I tried a bite of my friend's pancakes off of their brunch menu and they were very nutty, but good.  (I'm just biased in that aspect since I don't like nuts).,The place is very tiny though.  So good luck on finding a seat if the place is packed.  Very cute and clean.,Would return, even if I'm not vegan :)"
"2423 Galiano St, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/4/2018,$$,5,Stephanie’s Crepes,Absolutely positively delicious crepes. Vegans: Order the Veggi Edamame (without the aioli); it does not disappoint! And the Protein Choco-Nana is made with Vega protein powder and almond butter...so good! And my bros loved Scrambled Eggs with Cheddar; they even ordered another after devouring the first!
"1201 Coral Way, Miami, FL 33145",7/24/2016,$$,5,Mykonos Greek Restaurant,"Great selection of vegan dishes plus all the traditional Greek entrees that we all love. Friendly staff, great food and awesome location make this a must for everyone."
"5241 NW 87th Ave, Doral, FL 33178",6/10/2018,$$,4,Dragonfly Izakaya & Fish Market,"Japanese restaurant with Yummy appetizers! We ordered several and they were all great. My friend is a Vegan and she found delicious options. The tempura mushrooms as well as the shrimps were wonderful.,The strip steak was excellent and the broccoli appetizer as well.,The exotic cocktails were deelish. I had the Sake-like cocktail and my friend the whiskey-inspired cocktail. Everything was wonderful and the setting and decor are really nice.,DORAL is coming around and places like Dragonfly are helping it get there.,The waiter was a delight with helpful suggestions that were right on the mark. ,Young guy with a beard and a great personality to boot.,Nice place, Dragonfly!"
"7744 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",2/16/2016,$$,4,Grill Argentino,"Rincon Argentino is a nice, and cozy place, please if you are a vegan or veggie I will recommend not to come near this place. I arrive with a couple of my aunt, cousin, and sister. The friendly staff of the location immediately welcomed us.,We share some empanadas and sauce for our appetizer. This is of the few times that I do not repeat the sauces, I don't know what they add to it, but the taste and texture were incredibly delicious. Las empanadas were good too, it saw like in Miami almost every restaurant know how to make homemade and traditional empanadas.,For my main plate, I order La Picaña (The Picanha) is a cut of beef that is very popular in Brazil. In the U.S. it is little known, but referred to as the rump cover, rump cap or culottes. North American butchers generally divide it into other cuts like the rump, the round, and the loin. ,I order this cut of the beef because I was told by my sister that is the best cut she has taste and she describes how delicious can be.  This cut is big enough to feed two people, it comes with two-piece of beef cut, the picanha was delicious! The meat was very tender, the flavor was wonderful, juicy, everything about the cut was perfect everything like my sister told me, I truly recommend it, more if you looking to share a plate with someone."

"5800 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",9/29/2015,$$,4,ROK:BRGR American Kitchen and Cocktails,"I've been meaning to do this review now for a bit. I love this place it's just a shame it's so far from me . I would totally be a fat ass if I wasn't.living in Homestead. the menu has a goood selection and a little pricey but they offer. 2 things with it quality and quantity so worth it  Do not bring you vegan friends here  I had the South Florida burger and loaded  tater tots. so yummy I dream about it. I'm a sucker for anything with Brie on it, but it doesn't stop there  they add pork belly , red onion marmalade  and truffle  aioli.....oh wait I added Bacon  Mind you all that sits on a burger. Then I added  loaded  tater tots comfort food at its best ladies and gents.  Bacon is a definite part of the menu and they offer it in everything including their drinks. I was not so brazen I was too involved in the main course . The food it's awesome and I cant wait to go back it's way better then anything Sunset place has to offer."
"5800 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",3/3/2017,$$,3,ROK:BRGR American Kitchen and Cocktails,"It's worth it on a Monday lol. Idk if it's worth the 20+ bucks each per person you know? Waiters are whatever. It has a nice aesthetic, clean. Unique burgers. Have yet to go for brunch though  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options. My favorite is the turkey burger. Fries are good."
"21 NW Miami Ct, Miami, FL 33128",6/4/2014,$$,5,Cane A Sucre,"It is important to note that I hardly take the time to write a review, but this jewel is worth every minute. I am a born again Vegan and their vegan sandwich tops every restaurant in downtown's radius. I used to go to Fratelli di Milano for their portobello sandwich and pay a bleeding $10.00, but  today I found my new love, CANE A SUCRE. I am so hooked on their menu, that I go through the stress of downtown traffic just to have lunch there. Miamians do not waste your time and money going elsewhere, this is the spot that will educate your palate."
"185 SE 13th St, Miami, FL 33131",1/31/2018,$$,5,Raw Republic,Best Vegan Pies!!! Everything is delicious! Their alternative chickpea tuna salad is better than most real tuna salads! The people are always outstanding! Service is kind and knowledgeable.
"185 SE 13th St, Miami, FL 33131",1/31/2018,$$,5,Raw Republic,This is the best vegan restaurant in brickell by far! The service is incredible and the food is so delicious :)!
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2012,$,4,La Latina,"This place is super cute!  It is a small, unassuming place on the outside, but very warm, friendly and inviting on the inside! They use gluten free products and meat without any hormones, etc. and they are starting to serve vegan mini cupcakes from Bunnie's.  ,Hubs and I tried a variety of things - Pabellon empanada, cheese & sweet plantains empanada, the Reina Pepeida and the Pelua arepas.  My favorite was the Reina Pepeida arepa.  It's seriously filled to the brim with a creamy chicken salad (creamy from the avocado - heavenly!),The decor is like you stepped into your Abuela's (grandma!) house and you're plopping down at the kitchen table for an afternoon snack.  ,Tasty, cheap and fun."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We LOVE this place. The arepas are INCREDIBLE; it's fast, so cheap, AND they catered a big party for us and were extremely professional / organized / on-time. They even have a vegan/vegetarian menu (although, it's kind of lost on me.) They don't skimp on the meat/cheese and the sauces are OUT of this world."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/1/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We came here after the House of Roots kava bar. Although small, don't let it fool you, this place makes incredible arepas for various eaters from vegan to your average meat eater. My boyfriend had the beef arepa as did his friend. This was a nice stop along way before heading over to the Secret Garden Halloween party. I ordered the cheese and avocado arepa. It was so fresh and just mouth watering. We also shared the cheese sticks that his friend ordered. ,I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area even though I'm not a fan of where the restaurant actually is. We didn't have a hard time parking but it's in an area where cars are zooming past and since its Miami, of course, certain drivers can be a bit reckless from time to time. It also didn't help that it was raining like crazy. ,The decorations of this place are gorgeous. It reminded me of what it was like back when I visited Mexico. The colors were pastel and beige. Everything just blended in so nicely. ,I highly recommend bringing a date, a friend, or even a small group before going out or even during the day when it's nice and sunny since it'll be better. There's also a brewery around the corner where you can get a drink after enjoying the delicacies of some avant garde arepas."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/13/2018,$,5,La Latina,"This place is a hidden gem. I ordered the bean and avocado arepa and it was delicious. They have vegan options available. The place itself it's interesting, they have cute old fashion hispanic decorations that takes me back to my cuban childhood."
"1100 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/10/2017,$$,5,Ohho Noodles Market,"This place is a Asian/Western Fusion/Authentic Restaurant. It is a cozy place that a lot of people from college students to professionals come to eat. If you don't like eating when it is busy, get there early, for lunch 1130 or 700 for dinner. Ohho has a large variety of not just Asian dishes, but some Korean, French and Italian as well. The way they use the different cultural dishes, makes this place fun to go eat at. You pick from the menu and go pay at the register. The staff brings the food out and refills your drinks. Water is free and Refills are free for Regular Ice Tea. If you want dessert after, repeat the process. All of the food is fresh and has Gluten/Vegan dishes as well. My family and I enjoy coming here to eat. Ohho also has Free Wi-Fi."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/12/2018,$,3,La Latina,"We were in the area and decided to check this place out for breakfast for their vegan arepas, which are all but two on their menu. I ordered my arepa with avocado and plantains, my husband ordered his arepa with black beans and avocado and a coffee. After we placed our order they let us know that they had no ripe avos! :( I'm part avocado so not having ripe ones is a big deal... We both had to settle for the black bean and sweet plantain arepas, which were pretty good just not what either of us initially wanted. ,Three stars for not having ripe avos AND for bringing my husbands coffee out after we had practically finished our arepas."
"185 SE 13th St, Miami, FL 33131",1/29/2018,$$,5,Raw Republic,"Have had acai bowls all over the country...Raw Republic has the best by far!

"117 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/15/2017,$,4,La Nonna Italian Restaurant,The food was decent. I'm also a vegan so there wasn't much option....but I was with a party of 3 and everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. I was recommend this place because of their affordable prices for great portions of food.
"97 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/4/2018,$$,3,La Moon Restaurant,The food is amazing. They even have some vegan options. The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because the server will take her time. It will take the server extra 20 mins to come back to you table. Ever time I need her I saw her chit chatting with a coworker. Had to even get up several times just to get her attention. Besides that the food is amazing. I recomend takeout if you don't want to wait.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/29/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Where do I begin? A friend recommended this restaurant. I came in and met Ruth and Damian, the owners, who were absolutely pleasant. I am not normally a ""vegan"" person, so I let Ruth guide the way as I ordered a few bowls to bring home to the family. ,At our table of five, we all agreed that the food was DELICIOUS. Each and every item--Korean Fried ""Chicken"", Chipotle Cashew, Creamy Combinasian--has its own distinct, bold flavor. ,I am adding this spot to my list of favorites."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/24/2018,$$,4,CombinAsian,"Happy to report, there's a new vegan kid on the block... Actually, CombinAsian it's our first vegan Asian restaurant in Sun City. We are living in modern times, my friends!!!,The place it's cozy and easy to find... No doubt, Wynwood is where most interesting things are happening right now.,Portions are huge and prices are super reasonable. They offered mostly bowls and Big Rolls. And ladies and gentlemen, the big rolls are on steroids: Enormous.  It's like a full meal rolled into pure goodness.,I tried the Tasty Teriyaki Big Roll for $9 . I chose jackfruit as my meatless protein, and  it comes with lettuce, red onions, carrots and green peppers mixed on a teriyaki sauce. It was delicious. But now that I'm thinking about it, the only missing items were wasabe, ginger and soy sauce to complete the 'sushi' experience. ,I'll definitely be back... This is exactly the type of food I'm craving after a night of drinks in Wynwood. ,Happy hour, anyone??"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/16/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"CombinAsian is where it's at! I tried this restaurant for the first time last week. Being a NON-vegan I was a little skeptical about whether or not vegan food would taste good and be as filling as my typical meaty meals. I first tried the Cilantro Lime Bowl. It was packed with fresh veggies and sautéed tofu and topped with a refreshing cilantro lime sauce. I was impressed with the balance of ingredients, the overall flavor, and the fact that I didn't miss eating meat with my meal! I enjoyed my meal so much so that I decided to go back later that week. This time I tried the Kim Bap Pow Roll, which was also fresh, delicious, and filling. I ate it with a side of fried kimchi that added just the right amount of spice to my meal. The awesome food is accompanied by friendly owners and a relaxed atmosphere to eat."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,This was my first time at Wynwood and I knew there were a few vegan spots I wanted to try and I happened to come across this place by accident and was so happy I did. My sister and I got the creamy CombinAsian bowl which filled us up so quick. It was really really satisfying and yummy. They also had Chloe cupcakes which were so amazing I fell in love. This place had pretty loud edm type music when I was there which was cool and they had different types of board games on the tables which was great so you're not on your phones.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/23/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Best vegan option I've had in the area so far. excellent KFC chicken. Cool spot. Get you crispy on. Filling and satisfying.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/7/2018,$$,4,CombinAsian,"my family and I stop by this place about eight days after it opened. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. The food that was available was excellent. Finding nice vegan macaroni and cheese is difficult but my kids asked for seconds at this place. ,We ordered three different bowls, all of which were fantastic. ,Being a new restaurant, there were a few things that are still being settled i.e. running out of rice. But overall the food is very tasty and we would definitely come back again if in Miami in the future.. The restaurant has a great concept and I hope more people come out to Wynwood to try it."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Let me start off with I'm not vegan or vegetarian just so you have a clearer understanding that literally anyone can stop by and enjoy a heavy or light meal. First time here and me not ever trying tofu I was blown away with the scramble I had rice beans scramble and some Korean noodles wow the options are amazing and the owners welcomed me in with open arms. The dumplings are FIRE as in good crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I will be back and thanks again for breaking down what everything is made with and all the preparation it takes to make a good vegan dish. P.S. load up on the pineapple sauce you won't regret take my word for it.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/25/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,I am so glad i found this place! This is the tastiest vegan food ever a must try for sure! I love the environment and the fact that they have wifi  i am def coming back
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/9/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Awesome little place, a little slow but they'll catch that rythm. Definitely worth checking out even if, like me, you aren't vegan."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/5/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Pleasantly surprised. I am not a vegan, but I enjoy fresh foods.  I went for the ""Super Bowl"" - a combination of many items. Delicious and fresh. The sauces we had were also amazing. Excited to try the rest of the menu!"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"My family and I checked out this place the other day and we're so glad we did! It's hard to find authentic Korean food in Miami and the potatoes, spicy pickled cucumbers and japchae (Korean noodles) were the closest to the real deal back home in DC! I love the Asian/Korean spin on vegan burritos and bowls. It's sometimes a hit or miss with vegan foods, but I'm trying to eat cleaner and this bowl right here didn't let me down! I'm definitely a sauce girl and tried all of them. All four were delicious but the teriyaki along with sesame dash complemented my bowl quite well. I got the tofu scramble, ginger broccoli and japchae in my bowl and shared the Korean braised potatoes and spicy pickled cucumbers with my sister and cousins. They ordered different burritos (kimbap and customized) and they were all delicious. The interior is really cute and I love the stadium style seats. I've only seen it a couple other times in DC and love the chill laid back yet hip vibe at this place. Did I mention there is also a DJ?! Only in Miami! So happy that Miami now has a spot for vegan/Asian/Korean food for when I visit my cousins and hope to see more Korean dishes in the future!"

But yes, I am vegan and I according to the cashier their whole wheat patties in the vegetable, callaloo and tofu variety are vegan! Unfortunately there weren't any tofu ones available when I went today but I had a vegetable and callaloo one and can you say FLAVOR EXPLOSIONNN! Would be a five-star review if they had more of a selection veggie/Ital-friendly food."
"7030 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2016,$,3,Dogma Grill,"good location, fast service, not to friendly service though, pricey for items selected.  i am vegetarian, i had the vegetarian dog, with onions and fries.  The dog tasted good, like a regular hot dog to me.  The fries we slightly above average tasting.  My diet is mostly raw vegan, I dabble into fast food sometimes and high quality fast food is OK for me to eat.  After eating here I got a 24 hours stomach ache, which is a sign of low quality ingredients.  The food was tasty and I'll give it another try.  I will update my review and remove the upset digestion part if it doesn't recur.  This place is right by my office, so I want it to workout lol."
"7030 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/31/2017,$,4,Dogma Grill,"First off , gotta say the vegan hot dogs here are still some of the best in town. They stay open semi-late (10pm ish) and food is prepared relatively quickly.My only issue with Dogma Grill is the callous cashier who can't seem to take an order without giving attitude. I ordered something VERY simple, had to repeat myself 3 times and she still got the order wrong at the end with a big side of attitude.At that point I was just annoyed and didn't care for her to try and rectify the order. I'll be back for some delicious hotdogs hoping she'll be in a happier mood."

Aaron was our server, an incredibly delightful, knowledgeable and professional man! He's truly a gift to the establishment. 2 of us were vegan, 1 vegetarian, and the other pescatarian. They were extremely vegan-friendly and accommodated everything to our preferences. The noodles, eggplant, and dumplings are to die for. It has a great ambience and very well designed.

That's not an easy feat since there are 6 of us, and one is vegan, and another is vegetarian! I wish they had one further south. It's like chipotle, but with Mediterranean food! I rarely get to go since it's all the way in Doral. When I do go the food is great and the portions are big! It's very reasonably priced. The people aren't incredibly friendly, but I don't care. I go for the food, and it's not like you have to tip them. I'd go here every week, if I could!"

The menu allows vegan and gluten free options and they are considerate of these requests. The waitress, Kat, was so sweet and the wine is served in the cutest little carafe. Love this place!"

"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",10/4/2017,$$,3,Craftsman,"I tried out this spot, seeing it was under hot and new. I am a vegetarian and got excited to see the that there is a whole section on avocado on the menu. First, basically everything under the avocado side sounds like the same thing besides the avocado halves and the wrap. I decided to try out the vegan pizza, which I honestly thought would be more creative than just a regular avocado toast. Also wasn't to tasty. On the up side great, friendly service."
