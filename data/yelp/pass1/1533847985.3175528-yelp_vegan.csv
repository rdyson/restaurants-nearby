"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/12/2016,$$,5,grown,"Wow! Can't even begin to explain how special this place is. From the food, the vibe, and especially the owner, Shannon! We had the vegan & gluten free soup which was incredible!!! Also sampled the salmon burger & eggplant sandwiches which I'm craving already. They have many community events and specials so check out the instagram page. (That's how I found out about free yoga & yummy bites afterwards). The owner is incredible. Her mission is so clear and that is to spread the word about an organic lifestyle and cater to those who believe so deeply in it like she does. She literally went around from to table to table to speak to guests. If you aren't aware, she is Ray Allen's wife. The reason I bring that up is because she doesn't have to be running this restaurant, she has money. She does it because she truly has a passion and cares! She orders everything from the restaurant herself and makes sure it is locally sourced and organic! From the fruits, veggies, & meats! She also stores EVERYTHING in BPA free containers. Why would she do that? It is triple the amount of money and nobody will ever know. Again, because she CARES! What a beautiful lady , inside & out! Can't wait to go back (especially to try breakfast). By the way, GROWN caters to EVERYONE! Vegans, gluten intolerant, meat lovers...oh and wine lovers too! Check them out, you won't regret. P.S: For those complaining about price.. organic food (especially how they order) is pricey, you will not find that anywhere! Your body is a temple, take care of it! No amount of money can replace sickness or disease. There is no price on good health."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/24/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"I don't want to give this review as a recent convert to veganism, but as someone who has traveled quite a bit and has experienced different cuisines from all over the United States, Latin America, and Europe. I purposely seek out small family owned restaurants and shy away from chains.,Buffalo Bob is probably the best pizza I have ever had. The chicken was very tasty and was not overpowered with buffalo sauce. The cheese was just perfectly extra on the pizza, and the crust was fantastic. We followed up with ice cream. I had the Brownie Sunday, which after I had customized it was more like some hardcore chocolate on chocolate action. ,On the owners advice we returned the next morning for pancakes and holy cow! The banana blueberry pancakes were fire. The scramble was not missing anything (coming from a recent non-vegan background its hard to fool me) but my favorite was the sausage patties.,Ethically sourced food this good makes the conversion to full veganism a no brainer. Why not promote peace and love for our fellow creatures and inhabitants of this fascinating rock hurtling through space at 26 thousand miles an hour through some damn tasty food?!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/13/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"Knowing how great Choices Organic Café is, we knew we had to try this pizza place as soon as it opened. The outdoor seating setup is the same casual Grove dining as Choices, and the order by tablet option was quick/painless. While we ordered with the tablet, all of the staff were super nice and updated us as we waited on our pizza. Speaking of the pizza (Helen of Napoli): it was absolutely incredible, made to order with fresh ingredients, and worth the wait. We both agreed that it was the best vegan pizza either of us had ever had. It's essentially potatoes au gratin/loaded baked potato over a spectacular, risen-crust pizza. It was perfectly paired with a cup of delightfully sour mango lime kombucha to wash it down. Do yourself a favor and get some of this pizza in your mouth!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/1/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,Calling all vegans and non vegans!! Best vegan pizza hands down. The dough and cheese were both delicious. Comfort food pizza at its finest. I came with a big group and we got all the pizzas. The blueberry one was delicious. Definitely more savory than sweet so it was a nice surprise! Coming back next weekend for the opening of the ice cream shop!
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/9/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"Hands down best pizza I have ever had, vegan or not. The first time I showed up they were closed and cleaning up and still offered to bake up 3 pizzas and make 3 smoothies from Neo's Blender (in the same VShops Food Hall). Paid parking lot next door is easy but I have heard they boot if you are even a minute late, but for $3/hour ($1/20 mins), pay the extra :),I have had the Buffalo pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/29/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"It's in the building with the blue umbrellas. Holy crap was this phenomenal vegan food. Just order the blueberry pizza. It's incredible. My wife got the buffalo bob and it was ""the best buffalo item I've had since going vegan."",If you're vegan you need this experience."
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/6/2016,$$,5,Cream Parlor,"This has to be one of the most charming places I have ever visited in Miami....and beyond!Where do I begin? First of all, the staff is so friendly; the owners are incredibly accommodating with a kindness beyond compare and the food is to die for. Everything from the warm toasted paninis to the delectable ice creams. It's all so amazing. There's a cozy back patio, too. And vegetarian \ vegan options too. At Cream Parlor, every experience you have is a memorable one. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",10/3/2016,$$,4,Cream Parlor,"Im in love with this iscream parlour! The place is cozy with a few tables inside and there is a very nice outdoor patio in the rear that I loved. I enjoyed convo, icecream and the Avocado vegan toast there and felt very relaxed and comfortable. definitely a go to on an easy beeezy Sunday night!,I had a scoop of the unicorn poop + a scoop of the rum raisin and they were both delicious...nothing out of this world flavor wise but ice cream is ice cream.,Very family friendly place and I might be a bit weird but I wish they served some wine here for the grown ups too, while the kids enjoy their cones. the food menu needs some work as it relates to a more varied options but overall. I loved the ambiance. Wine, would make it truly official in my book.,."
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",8/30/2017,$$,3,Cream Parlor,"This place is good place to enjoy some very delicious ice cream, if you are not vegan then you would love Cream Parlor they invent new ice cream flavors every week which I think is amazing plus their food is also very full of delicious flavors, I would just say that the food is vey greasy so you might want to watch out for that ..."
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/10/2018,$$,5,Cream Parlor,"Oh my god! This place so so cute and has awesome food and service. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the curry bowl and the hummus makes it so BOMB!!!!! So flavorful and tangy and slightly smoky. Excellent vegan or vegetarian option. I also had the prosciutto toast with the apricot jam and goat cheese. Ugh, the flavors in my mouth...I saved a bite to have as the last thing in my mouth. My friend got a smashed potato with eggs bacon and cheese and she loved it. They take a whole baked potato and press it in the panini press until it becomes crispy and delicious and then topped it was eggs, cheese , and a mountain of bacon. And then the dessert. Make sure to try their ice cream flavors and then get an out of this world Sundae or malted milkshake!"
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/27/2017,$$,4,Cream Parlor,"Feel like I found a gem not far from home! Love this place because offers a variety of delicious meals , with many vegan options as well on a very cute and unique ambience.  It's very family friendly and My children's really like it.  I Just love it!! Will come back over and over again real soon ,   One of my favs. Are the hummus with warm pita , the petal rose latte , rose petal lemonade , unicorn poop ice cream and purple rain ice cream as well."
"186 SE 12th Ter, Miami, FL 33131",12/7/2017,$$,5,Nikko By Sunshine,Nikko has been my go to Thai restaurant. They are always willing to accommodate my request to make certain dishes vegan and answer any questions I have with regards to a dish and what it contains. I have the pad thai with tofu and their coconut soup. Their food is always delicious and I would highly recommend trying them.
"301 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/3/2018,$$,5,Doc B’s Fresh Kitchen,"Have been here three times and really like this place! Waitstaff is super friendly, great decor and awesome food. Portion size is generous and lots of variety for vegetarians/kosher/vegans (all of who we've eaten with here). Would def recommend for brunch or dinner!!"
"301 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/3/2018,$$,5,Doc B’s Fresh Kitchen,Great atmosphere! Plenty of Vegan options! I had the Tofu Wok Out Bowl and it was delicious! Our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful. I'll be back! Recommended!
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/17/2016,$$,4,grown,Excellent food overall. Had the free range chicken wrap Capri Salad Style along with a vegan minestrone soup. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion for a fast food type of place.
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",5/25/2016,$$,4,grown,"A nice fast food restaurant. The employees were very friendly. They greeted each customer immediately at the door. The sitting area was very cute. The tables were a little small but I think that for a fast food restaurant it is not a big issue. We ordered two smoothies, a salad with Havana vibe and salmon, and a wrap with salmon. The food came with soups - Chicken tortilla and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup. The food was very good. All ingredients were fresh and tasted delicious. The only thing that surprised me was the bill. The food is a little bit too pricey for a fast food restaurant. The total bill was $58! But I guess they have to pay the Pinecrest's rent!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/30/2016,$$,5,grown,"Only been open a month and is doing very well! Everything on the menu is incredibly fresh , the ambiance is adorably cute, and there is open-air (covered) seating. I had the Grown Simple Greens wrap and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup which were delicious. The silverware and plates are made of renewable materials and the juices are amazing. Try the Love Greens!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/4/2017,$$,5,grown,"Food that tastes great and makes you feel good ordering. Everything is USDA organic. This is also an excellent place for vegetarians, vegans, people with dietary restrictions, allergies, etc. ,The salmon was fine dining quality on a paper plate. I recommend trying the Mexican corn. ,Since it is was our first time, the manager, Chris, walked us through the menu and gave us samples to try. Bonus points for excellent service. ,As others have mentioned, this place is more expensive than other counter service restaurants, but I would argue the food quality and taste is MUCH better. We enjoyed dinner so much, we splurged for dessert (something we rarely do). Excellent too!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",1/4/2017,$$,4,grown,"I enjoyed my visit here when I came early on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend. The food was tasty enough, and there were plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. The reason why I give this restaurant four stars instead of five is because it was extremely pricey for the portion sizes we were getting. We both left feeling hungry after spending $xx amount on our breakfasts. I wish they had bigger portion sizes. Also, it gets very crowded on weekends, mainly with local families coming after a soccer match, etc."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",3/30/2017,$$,5,grown,"I loved this restaurant!!  I had the wild salmon on a gluten free wrap with the simple greens, soup was included and I had the chicken and mushroom. My soup was very tasty and my wrap was scrumptious!  I was only able to have half of my wrap because it's quite large so next time I'll order an extra soup and share the wrap. I didn't have dessert but on my way out saw they had vegan and gluten free desserts which I will try next time. Can't wait to visit them again. ,Ps- I was very impressed that they had Rudi's gluten free bread, wild salmon and free range chicken. I wish I would've had access to a ""fast food restaurant"" like this when my kids were small. I'll definitely be taking my grandkids!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/16/2017,$$,5,grown,Stopped in for lunch for the first time.  Simply amazed! The owner Shannon was very wonderful and informative on the healthy styles of eating. We were offered a complimentary dessert that was vegan delicious.
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",6/5/2017,$$,3,grown,"I heard a lot of hype coming into this place, and while the food is fine, it's nothing all that outstanding.  I came for breakfast, and it seems like a great deal that you can get home fries, bacon, and fruit for $5, until you see that it's less food than you would've gotten for the same price at IHOP.  For all the gluten-free, local-source, vegan-friendly, blah, blah, blah, you see, the food was pretty bland and basic.  I'm not saying the food isn't good.  I'm just saying that their cage-free, macrobiotic, whatever, whatever eggs taste the same as what I have in my fridge from Publix.  Now, I'm not going to lie, their juices and smoothies are really good, but they set you back about $10.  If paying $10 for a great smoothie is something that wouldn't bother you, then grown is right up your alley."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/1/2018,$$,3,grown,"So, this place is delicious and healthy and yes everything tastes extremely fresh and natural however ridiculously overpriced. TWO wraps and a cookie came out to $42!!! What?! Kind of insane. I was shocked at how expensive it was. I tried the Mediterranean wrap and the Havana wrap both with chicken- they were delicious I can't deny that. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was also amazing- very flavorful and yummy. Decorated very cute. I wish there were more places like this- they even have a drive thru. My only complain was the price and it's a shame but I wouldn't return because of it."
"3401 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/22/2012,$$,5,Sakaya Kitchen,"The vegan BBQ tofu special - brown rice, baby bok choy, and Miami's best Brussels sprouts - is incredible and unmatched by anywhere I've been since my last visit, including my own kitchen (though my pan-fried tofu is better). With sides of cucumber pickle (kirby cucumbers sliced in what I thought was sweet rice vinegar) and kimchi (better than what I got in the farmers' market at Fort Greene in Brooklyn): $13.90 before the tip. ,I ate here twice a week for about five months, and it was always a treat! You must try the fried shrimp. It's only the second place where the shrimp was so nicely fried that I could eat the shell, which can be really tasty. ,Props on the tunes! And shout-outs to Malika and Maylin and the entire team."
"15 NE 11th St, Miami, FL 33132",6/4/2015,$$$,4,Rooftop At E11even,"Good vegan sushi, impressive! I will be back"
"3401 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/27/2018,$$,5,Sakaya Kitchen,"The food was soooo good! They gave plenty of substitute options and gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options are available as well! The Bulgogi sandwich, KFC, Bok Choy, Jasmine rice and Korean beef are awesome! On top of that Pat, the cook, came out to make sure everything was great. She is ,! Very highly recommend!"
"250 NW 24th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/20/2018,$$,3,Crudos Fusion Art,"Im a vegan , so the menu did not show any vegan options , so I asked the waiter if it was possible to make something vegan and she was really friendly and explained to me that the chef could make any plate vegan. ,Went on a Thursday and they had a DJ with pretty good music . ,Food was good a little salty but I enjoyed it , may be could be better for non vegan .,We had the check and and they charged same price as if meat was included , we asked the waiter if she could was why and she did but the chef just said that he put more vegetables , thought that ,was not the right way to handle not a great customer service on his part but I guess he is not the owner so he did not care!!"
"228 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",4/17/2015,$,5,Freshko Gourmet,"I ordered for delivery and food was here promptly. I ordered the ""vegan salad"" and their hummus, I know doesn't seem like much, but that meal was delicious!!  The salad was super fresh w baby arugula and the hummus and some of the best I've had around downtown Miami! But heads up, you can't add tip to your receipt once the meal arrives, you have to add it in advance. The deliverer was also extremely nice, and I owe him a few more bucks!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/28/2018,$$,5,ITAMAE,"Start off with a fresh tatami small plate, and work your way through the entire menu please - you won't be disappointed. Vegan or gluten allergies? No worries, Chef Fernando always got your back. My favorite dish is the Nikkei Bowl. Favorite sushi is the Lost in translation or the Sansho (creamy a.f.). Pro tip: pair it all with their japanese bubbly sodas."
"228 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",12/19/2016,$,5,Freshko Gourmet,"Delicious soy cappuccino. I subbed the mozzarella in the veggie panino with their balsamic vinegarette to veganize it, and it was super yummy. Great service. Reasonably prized. Perfect ambiance for a relaxed weekend brunch. No wait to be seated on a Sunday afternoon."
"228 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",8/21/2017,$,5,Freshko Gourmet,"This place is pretty cool the food was fresh and the service was okay being that there was only one server. The vegan salad is arugula, quinoa, tomatoes and cucumber was delicious."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/6/2015,$$,4,Burger & Beer Joint,"It's a decent place with a nice outdoor seating area, plenty of craft beer on tap and the staff is awesome. Of course, being Vegan I thought it would be difficult to find something here but they had a great Kale and Quinoa salad option. Only problem, they were out of Kale which I'm told happens often. If you're going to offer something that people will like as an option why be out of it since Kale is not plutonium. In other words, you can get it in every supermarket! They substituted with Spinach which was fine and the quinoa was awesome. I would definitely come back but they better not be out of Kale again."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/10/2018,$$,4,Burger & Beer Joint,"For vegans: There's a veggie burger (quinoa, beans, peppers), a quinoa & kale salad, and sweet potato fries/ skinny fries. They also have ""duck fat"" fries.... make sure to differentiate. The others in my group had plenty to eat, and enjoyed it. I had a nice glass of wine. The food was ready very fast and was reasonably priced."
"5600 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",3/20/2017,$$,5,Andiamo,"I was stuck on a field trip and a classmate recommended we sneak away for pizza. I was game since I'm vegan and didn't want to struggle to get vegan options in Little Haiti. Our server, Jennifer, was great. It's never fun to be the vegan asking about what's in the crust, etc. But Jennifer was nice and patient and checked things for me. I loved my pizza! So delicious! My non vegan classmate's pizza looked amazing! The other classmate got a salad which looked ok. Thank you Jennifer!"
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/3/2018,$,4,Spoleto,"Been to Spoleto at Dadeland Mall twice and loved the fresh options, generous portions,  homemade pasta and Flatbread. They make everything in front of you from scratch!  Food is definitely better than anything in the food court and much better prices than the larger restaurants.  For the most part a very committed young staff. Make sure you are very clear when you are specifying vegan or vegetarian."
"3000 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/4/2017,$$,5,Mabruk,"Amazing food,falafel was tasty and fresh! Cheaper than other places in the area. Hummus was delicious and so was taboule salad , great customer service our fave new place ,great option for vegans !!"
"3791 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33146",3/6/2018,$,4,El Rinconcito El Chele,"Good  (not great) food. Staff is a bit rude on the phone. If you do not speak Spanish they will hang up on you. They have a nice selection with options for vegetarian diets, vegan diets, and those with food allergies. Delivery time can take a while but over all decent for quick meal."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/23/2015,$$,5,Seasons 52,"One of the absolute BEST restaurants in South Miami. Everything here is perfect, the service, ambiance, and food are impeccable, and I am never disappointed. I took my parents here when they were visiting, and as huge foodies my dad said the veal was the best he has ever had, while the menu also has dishes for me (a vegan). The price is more than fair for the quality of meals, and you will NOT be disappointed. Season's 52 has my highest recommendation possible."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/15/2014,$$,5,Seasons 52,"This was the perfect location for my medical school graduation lunch. Service was great, food was delicious and we loved our experience. I would definitely go back and have another meal. I also liked the fact that they had a vegan menu for my Aunt and they are über accommodating for those with dietary needs."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/27/2015,$$,5,Seasons 52,"This is a great restaurant for those who care about healthy food and, especially, for vegetarians. Ask for the vegetarian menu. There's also a gluten-free menu, and a vegan menu -- you just have to ask. The options are extensive and include a Winter Vegetarian Tasting plate. Highlights from our meal today included the Warm Roasted Tomato Caprese Salad, the Roasted Basciani Farms Mushrooms, and the vegetarian soft taco. My partner had the trout and was very pleased. For dessert, our favorite was the Blueberries with Lemon Curd. I also recommend the cocktails -- Meyer Lemonade is very tasty. Our waiter, Camillo, was fantastic -- kind and attentive."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/15/2015,$$,3,Seasons 52,"Overall, Season's 52 was a solid experience.  My husband and I were looking for a vegetarian restaurant (in addition to my gluten and dairy allergies).  Their menu was a little bit inefficient since they have separate menus for gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan.  It was a bit overwhelming for me since a majority of the gluten-free menu was non-vegetarian.  However,  our server quickly found someone who could manage it and make recommendations.  We ordered the duo hummus for an appetizer, and I found the texture to be a little rough.  We had the warm beet salad, which was good and the vegetarian entree which was good as well and the restaurant accommodated my food allergies greatly in this meal.  ,If you go to the restaurant, i would recommend sitting in the main room or room adjoining to the bar.  We were put in an add-on room, which was freezing.  I complained several times, and 2 other tables near us complained about how cold it was too."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/8/2016,$$,5,Seasons 52,"Delicious menu and great ambiance! They have food for everyone! Gluten sensitive, lactose free, dairy free, sodium friendly, vegan and vegetarian!! Plus they have 52 glasses of wine by the bottle!! Not to mention the service was amazing!"
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/25/2017,$$,5,Seasons 52,"I've come to Seasons 52 a number of times and it does not cease to disappoint when it comes to the seasonal menu, the freshness of ingredients and the atmosphere are all great reasons to keep coming to seasons. And lets not forget their stuffed shrooms, which are absolutely a must try. I would come back and just order them and nothing else. I think their flatbreads are also pretty great and a surefire way to get in a good meal, however I wouldn't vouch for their brunch flatbreads. I would have been fine without the smoked salmon flatbread. I would come back again though, but would come back more so for the dinner menu. I would also recommend this restaurant for vegetarians and vegans, has pretty decent options. Their desserts are also a small but filling indulgence that doesn't make me feel too bad for breaking my diet."
"7378 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/1/2016,$$,5,Bangkok City Thai & Seafood Restaurant,"Bangkok City has been recommended to me by COUNTLESS people since I moved to the area about a month ago. I thought to myself, not everyone can be wrong about this place so I'll give it a try, even though I already have my usual Thai restaurant. I started with the basics - tom-coconut soup, pad thai, and red curry tofu, ALL were out of this world. The curry dishes in particular really blew me away. It's not just the cuisine here that's incredible, but the staff is so welcoming and nice that it almost makes me want to stay and eat there when I'm picking up a to-go order! As a vegan, I now eat here at least three times a week since I can get veggies and tofu made in so many different ways. Bangkok City is now my go-to spot for Thai or sushi."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/15/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"We went to Vegan and Juice today for lunch, it was delicious!! I ordered the brown rice, cauliflower, eggplant lasagna, and the pumpkin spinach. EVERYTHING was delicious and flavorful. And the best part was how nice everyone was! In Miami it's so hard to find truly kind people who appreciate thank you's and are actually happy to have you in their establishment. We will definitely be going back very soon!! Thank you soooo much!! O and their fresh juices are made to order !"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/21/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Honestly, I was so turned off by vegan food before coming here. My friend encouraged me to come and try and have fallen in love with the food here since. Although it's small, the food is fresh and surprisingly DELICIOUS. I never feel bloated after eating here in comparison with so many other restaurants. This restaurant is as tasty and healthy as it gets. The owner is always there and so attentive. A little pricey but worth it."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/24/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Outstanding! Hands down, my favorite vegan restaurant. And I am a meat-eater! The staff is warm and makes you feel like family. They will have already run out of some of their best items around 1 p.m. so get there at 11 a.m. and you will get to try everything on their daily rotating menu (don't forget the soup!). They even have a ""cabana card"" for frequent eaters. I have eaten at some really good vegan restaurants, yet BOTH the taste and price of the food at Vegan & Juice are completely untouchable!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/26/2012,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I happen to be vegan, but I would still eat here even if I wasn't. The food is DELISH! The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. Also, they have an option to purchase meals for the week --which I want to try out here soon. The staff is inviting and kind.  The atmosphere is cozy and don't  leave without trying one of their vegan baked goods. Mmmm Mmmm Good!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/22/2013,$,5,Vegan & Juice,A vegan gem in the middle of Sweetwater of all places. The wraps are delicious and the chocolate blueberry cake is amazingly moist. Can't wait to go back to try more things!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/30/2013,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegetarian/vegan food with a Latin twist.  The menu varies daily and is generally posted on Facebook by 10-11 am.  Smoothies/wraps/salads are available, with veggie pizza on Thursdays.  Otherwise, one can order four sides for $8.50, with sides ranging from baked yuca, plantains, beans, steamed veggies, brown rice, and a pumpkin/veggie soup.   Buy a ""cantina"" and get 5 meals at a price of $7.40 (15% discount)."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/25/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Absolutely delicious! Highly recommended! First attempt at a Vegan dish, it was wonderful!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/17/2013,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"If this is vegan --- I'm in!!! ,At the request of a friend, I decided to try their daily ""cantina""...V&J will prepare a plate consisting of four different dishes for you @ a great price... ,Although I am NOT a strict vegan, I can tell you that their food is delicious!!!! The soups are tasty (and not heavily seasoned or salted); their quinoa is yummy and filling and their plantains / boniato or sweet potato mash are all sensational... They offer freshly made items every day and the veggies taste divine (always) cooked to perfection, never overpowered with lots of condiments. ,I have been doing their vegan diet in the evenings for just 2 weeks, and I feel more energetic, much less-bloated (no heavy salts nor fats in their food) and all-around healthier. ,Try their delicious dishes, you won't be sorry !!! ,(And the family that runs the biz could not be nicer or warmer with customers!)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/13/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I love this place! Their hot food is always different everyday, and all of their dishes, including the salads and wraps are DELICIOUS! They also sell juice that they make right in front of you. The people that work there are very friendly, and I couldn't ask for a better vegan and juice spot. Reasonably priced too!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/11/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"All vegan restaurants should be like this one, affordable and delicious! Great service too. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to eat something healthy and tasty. They even filter the water in which they cook with, something I do at home. The desserts are also a must when you visit this place. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/8/2012,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is a hole-in-the-wall kind of restaurant that happens to be vegan. It seems their ideals and meals are centered on the vegan lifestyle (which I love) but that is not the first thing that comes to mind when entering. Rather than taking the typical vegan-holier-than-thou approach, they take a ""welcome to my kitchen"" approach. ,The menu changes daily, has a hispanic tendency, and is always so so delicious. It's filling, comforting, and fresh. They make deliciously fresh juices and smoothies and have absolutely amazing desserts (sometimes raw too!). ,I'd recommend going no matter what your eating preferences, if you're into wholesome and warming foods. If you're vegan and you want to take a non-vegan to eat this is the place. My sig. O loves it and he's not vegan in any way."

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/21/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I've been coming to this spot since I was 12 years old! This my favorite vegan spot in all of Miami and I'm lucky enough to live real close by them. It's cheap, flavorful and the variety is endless. Be careful though, their eggplant lasagna is vegetarian ( contains cheese) and they have vegetarian pizza too. The rest is vegan. My favorite dishes are the ceviche tofu, lentils, spinach taco, stuffed peppers. It goes on and on!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/27/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Hands down my favorite plant-based restaurant in Miami.  They serve Latin vegan food with unbelievable flavor they can make simple cabbage taste amazing.  They also have amazing homemade raw pies & cheesecakes available.  The best part:  a plate full of your choice of four dishes from their hot menu & a piece of pie is only $13!!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/22/2013,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Healthy, homemade vegan and vegetarian food at an affordable price. Family owned and rubbed restaurant. Love it!"

Small family owned vegan restaurant serves a variety of hot foods plus wraps, smoothies, and desserts. The owner and his crew are amazing and will treat you like family. I love this place!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/19/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Great choice for vegans and vegetarians, everything is made right in front of you and the employees are wonderful!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/19/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Now, I have say I am not a vegan, but I find myself craving the juices and hummus wrap from V&J! It is a FRESH as it gets here! You often see the owner(s) bringing in the fresh produce and they are extremely hands on with their establishment. The place is small and tends to get very busy during lunch, so if you can go just before 12:00PM, you will be IN & OUT! I have yet to have some of the hot meal offerings, but the hummus wrap is great! Also, I have had the detox juice everytime I have visited! The place is also very clean & service is great!"
"1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/10/2018,$$,5,My Ceviche,"This is a restaurant with great healthy, gluten free options , and vegan options.  The prices are extremely reasonable to cheap and service is quick. The Resturant is set up similar to a chipotle inside."
"2613 NW 79th Ave, Miami, FL 33122",7/15/2017,$$,5,Doral Thai Restaurant,"This has to be my favorite Thai restaurant by far. The taste is very similar to actual Thai food straight from Thailand. I recommend also to those who are vegan, this place is the bomb! The Gang Phak is so good! It has mixed veggies, red curry with coconut milk and it comes with a side of rice."
"2613 NW 79th Ave, Miami, FL 33122",4/29/2017,$$,5,Doral Thai Restaurant,"No complaints! Very cute interior, super nice lady who attended me at pick up & delicious vegan/vegetarian friendly options. I recommend the veggie spring rolls, vegetable pad Thai (no egg) & the tofu red curry."
"5 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",3/3/2018,$$,4,MOMI Ramen,"This plAce was very authentic. I liked the place and the food was very tasteful. However when we got there we actually dis not know that the place had a cash only policy and prices where not as displayed here any ramen bowl was over 25$ I felt it deserves 3 $$$ signs. You are getting a decent bowl of food too but I just feel it is a but overpriced no matter how good the ramen is. One good thing is that the price i think includes a drink, we got a bottle of water as usual. I just believe the price is set very high it may be because of the location. However, food is delicious and very tasteful. Vegan option is a rockstar just remember to tell them you do not want the egg in your plate lol."
"7919 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/28/2018,$$,5,Cake’s Thai Kitchen,The greatest Thai food in Miami. They are SO NICE and have many vegan options. I highly recommend the eggplant chili miso tofu as well as the Chinese broccoli. The Tom Yum and Tom kha soup are both delicious. I could honestly eat this place for breakfast lunch and dinner it is so good!!  For an additional experience ago and it's a little bit hidden and worth it for delivery every single time
"301 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/12/2016,$$,5,Tap 42,"They have Vegan available ""VA"" options throughout their menu! Service, environment, drinks and food was beyond expectations!"
"301 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/6/2017,$$,5,Tap 42,"The salmon bowl is AMAZING! Great menu with creative simple fare. They have gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options. Their kitchen is open late, so it was a great stop after a concert in Coral Gables."
"301 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/15/2018,$$,5,Tap 42,"First timers. Prompt friendly hostess. Clean, cool, environment. Loud,but not rowdy. Danny was our waiter, very polite and did a great job! The decor is interesting. My husband and I ordered Golden Quinoa superfood salad (minus the feta), Grilled salmon Zen bowl, Asian Slaw and Roasted Brussel sprouts. All plates came out looking appetizing, each dish unique and full of flavor. Our favorite was easily the Asian Slaw! My husband is convinced that the grilled salmon would've been amazing on top of the Asian Slaw! This is a great spot if you want great service, delicious food and a loud atmosphere. We didn't drink, but maybe in the future. Thanks for a great experience, we consider ourselves a little difficult with food! In the future I'd love to see more Vegan options OTHER than salad!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/3/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Dominican style vegan food...ridiculous!! I'm here visiting my family and I've come three times to eat here. Every time has been amazing! Glad to see these type of spots in Mia, much needed! I highly recommend you to try their hot meals on any given day."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/9/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is vegan comfort food at its very best!  If you are looking for atmosphere, this is not the spot, however, if you are looking for healthy, stick to your ribs, vegan comfort food, you will not be disappointed.  The food is made fresh daily.  Follow their FB page for the daily menu (with a pic!).  The quality here is exceptional.  The hot food is always perfectly seasoned.  The juice is always the freshest.  They even have raw desserts.  I've reviewed the raw cinnamon rolls at some other local spots.  They also have them here.  OMG!!!!!  They are little raw pieces of yummilicious crack.  They taste just like the Little Debbie Pinwheels from back in the day only they are made strictly with fruits, nuts, veggies and seeds.  MAGICAL!!!  Don't start.  You will not be able to stop.  ,All in all, this is the best bang for the buck in Vegan MIA.  The food is amazing, the prices cannot be beat!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/4/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Very impressive find. I went there for lunch. They had a great buffet style selection of Vegan deliciousness. As in the other reviews, lunch gets quite busy, though the staff is efficient and kind. Try some juice as well, organic, and tasty."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/13/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Wow! Is all I have to say! Most people expect vegetarian/vegan food to be tasteless and dull yet in Vegan and Juice they are able to season all their foods to perfection. Their juices are made fresh in front of you and they use a masticating juice which retains all the fibre in the fruits and vegetables. I thoroughly enjoyed their lunch menu. I had whole grain rice, beans, veggie empanada and zucchini stuffed with tofu. To end on a good note my boyfriend and shared a banana cake which was also absolutely delicious. Will definitely come back!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/23/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"5 stars for quality and value. I was craving veggies, a good vegan mean, and wasn't ready to spend $15 on one. I yelped and ended finding this gem. The staff was friendly, told me about their menu and pointed out their hot bar, too. I opted for the Avocado Mambo wrap, and indeed it was a ""mambo"", HUGE. I saw the staff cut the veggies right in front of me, peeling the onion, opening the avocado, preparing this delicious vegan feast for me. For $6.96, you can't find a tastier, fresher wrap. I'll be coming back for another wrap and a fresh presses juice."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/15/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is absolutely excellent. Not enough good things I can say about it. The restaurant is impeccably clean and the food is mouthwateringly delicious. I am not vegan or vegetarian, I am a total meat eater, yet I love this place. I've had the cooked food, the wraps (avocado mambo) and their juices (abc and reggae) and everything has been amazing. It is family owned and you can tell they take pride in their product. The prices are excellent for the quality and freshness they provide. The location is sketchy, but it's sweetwater. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone, vegans to diehard meat eaters alike, you will not regret your visit."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/3/2015,$,4,Vegan & Juice,My first time today. Was craving a green smoothie and yelp showed me this place ! So far so goood. I give it a four bcuz i havent tried other things but its cheap! Considering vegan prices
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/9/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Great tasting vegan food. Flavorful and delicious. Today had the eggplant lasagna, black beans,yuca pastelon and pumpkin soup. The staff is always friendly, helpful and always smiling. Will continue to come here for my vegan fix"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/8/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is simply marvelous. I'm not vegan; in fact, I'm as carnivorous as they come! But I have been flirting with the idea of reducing my meat intake, and Vegan & Juice has only sparked my curiosity even more! The menu changes daily. When I went last Saturday, I opted for a broccoli/carrot stir fry, malanga mash, and lentils. I don't know what these people do to their vegetables, but broccoli and carrots never tasted SO GOOD. Their juices are also perfectly made and very fresh, and the owners are very sweet. I can't wait to come back here to see what else I can catch on the menu!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/16/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"BEST Hispanic vegan/vegetarian food ever! Absolutely love every dish. And the costumer service is amazing, they are all so friendly. Watch out, you will get addicted!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/18/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan and Juice is truly a gem. Its simple and unpretentious location is no indication of it's amazing food. The owners create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere while providing excellent food options. ,This little restaurant is owned by a Dominican family. The infamous Dominican flavors are prominent in all their dishes (prepared daily). Not only is their menu healthy and varied, it's also incredibly affordable. The owners keep the restaurant extremely clean. And of course their menu VEGAN."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/7/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Very tasty and delicious food. The folks who run the place are very friendly. The food options are varied and all taste great. The juices are equally as good. The 39 dollar cantina is a great bargain if you frequent Vegan.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/4/2013,$,4,Vegan & Juice,Tucked away in a little shopping mall is this vegan spot. Everything looks fresh and the juices are made to order. It is a little on the expensive side (why is it that healthy food always is?) but now and again my body just needs some love. They serve hot lunch and big salads.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/20/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Where do I begin? This place is great. All vegan. All Latino deliciousness. For 9 bucks you can get four large portions of a variety of different dishes. They have a yuca lasagna that is incredible. The juices are great too. Always pick anything with garbanzo. Kind staff great vibe! Right by the university. I love it here.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/16/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Everytime I have come here, I have enjoyed my order. They get creative with their food which makes it a great spot for vegans and vegetarians. The service is good too they are always so kind and helpful!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/7/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Being vegan in Miami makes it pretty hard to eat out. Whenever I find a restaurant that caters to vegans it's a miracle. I had been dying to try out Vegan & Juice for a couple weeks until I was finally able to and it did not disappoint. I had the avocado mambo wrap and a leafy lemonade and my friend had the same wrap but the Mamey strawberry and papaya smoothie and all of it was phenomenal ! From the service to the food It was all great ! I was just a little disappointed that by the time o got there their hot food was already sold out. So if you're going for a warms lunch its first come first serve. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try it. If you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth though make sure to also get there before they sell out when I got there the only dessert left was the cinnamon roll and chocolate pie which was fantastic !
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/24/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Best vegan food in town!! Everything I tried in this place is delicious!! From the ""pastelon the platano"" to the eggplant lasagna the pumpkin puree, the key lime pie the leaf lemonade ... There are so many awesome foods but those are my favorites. The owners Francisco and Jennifer are super friendly .The place is not fancy but don't be fool by the simplicity. Vegan and juice is a first class food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/21/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Little whole in the wall place, but food was fresh and tasty. I liked my avocado wrap and my boyfriend his salad.  Raw vegancinamon roll was great. Closing eyes on the location part everything was good."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/30/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is great! Friendly staff and delicious food. Everything is fresh and delicious. Can't believe I've lived right around the corner to this place and never came. Will definitely be coming more often. I suggest trying the raw vegan cinnamon rolls, they're amazing!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/17/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I love this place mainly because it's vegan comfort food for me. It has that Latin feel I love and I haven't been disappointed yet on their selection of ready to eat meals. Also, their juices and smoothies are amazing and fresh but at a reasonable price. You also get a big portion of food like Latins tend to do haha. It's not the most appealing decoratively but I honestly don't care as long as the place is clean, which it is, and the food is good, which it definitely is."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/8/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Absolute gem for vegans in West Miami. The plate is the way to go for those who have an appetite for varieties. 4 sides of delicious vegan dishes. Lots of different options to choose from. Great juices too!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/28/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Most vegan restaurants in the area are really expensive and upscale, but this one is super laid back and also you cant beat the prices! Great food, great wraps :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/1/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place! I've been to various vegan/vegatarian restaurants and this is definitely one that stands out from them all. very affordable! i have paid 12/13 for a full plate of full with extremely limited amount of food, so for them to charge 8.50 its pretty amazing with various options, i was a very happy camper. The plate is filling, healthy and of great quality. It breaks the paradigm that people have of healthy food being only ""salad"", ""boring"" and ""lacking in flavor"". That is not the situation here. The staff is friendly which most definitely also adds to the experience overall. Hopefully the increase into becoming available in various locations. Very happy that its near where i live. I recommend it to anyone trying out vegan/vegetarian food. The owners had health and budget in mind when creating this and I'm very thankful they went through with their vision. Their product is fruitful."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/30/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Every single thing offered here is delicious and makes you feel amazing after, no matter how much you eat! And the staff is polite and helpful. Definitely check this place out. Go vegan!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/6/2012,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Ever walked into a restaurant and felt like family? Well that is the atmosphere once you walk into this Family runned business. All smiles and wholesome food. They have about eight different types of selections a day to make a meal, not including the pizza's, veggie wraps( my fav) and desserts(sometimes they run out fast. Also the epic freshly made juices and smoothies that aren't pulled out of a fridge and handed to you. They're made in front of you so no sketchy ingredients added Lol. Promise you won't regret having lunch here, its a great organic non guilty meal without the cardboard taste that some vegan meals can have they have a Hispanic kick to the food. Love it!,Here is there facebook page, they have updates on the menu: "
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/9/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I'm so glad that I found this place! The staff is warm and welcoming, the food is delicious and extremely close to FIU, and the menu is always changing. The owners are Dominican like myself, and even though I'm an ""aspiring"" Vegan - it was great to taste their food and feel like I was getting a home cooked Spanish meal without the meat. Get here early if you want to take advantage of their menu! I will be returning frequently."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/18/2015,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Very tasty vegan and vegetarian dishes, I had the quinoa and eggplant lasagna, very good and healthy and they have a $8 special! ,Great place for healthy eaters!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/13/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Out of every vegan place in Miami that changes up its food every day, this is the very best one and definitely worth checking out! The juice is phenomenal, of course, as well as the food. There has never been a time where I hadn't liked something that was being served but even if that does happen to you, the wraps are also worth a try! The curry wrap is my favorite. Also make sure to buy the desserts! I give the brownies to my non-vegan friends and they love them."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/9/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"The first time I came here, I tried a juice and it was delicious! I made sure I came back a second time to try a wrap and it was so good! I had the avocado mambo, it was filling and delicious. While I was there, i overheard that they have been open for 16 years. I definitely recommend this place. Even if you aren't vegan, it's worth a try. The wraps are amazing."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/29/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Extremely affordable vegan lunch restaurant. Food is delicious, always pleased with my experience. Sometimes the lasagna isnt vegan so it's always important to ask. Manager and staff are incredibly warm and helpful. Make sure you don't leave without trying at least one of their dessert!! Vegan or not, I strongly recommend this restaurant."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/16/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place gets 5 stars; not because it is some Miami high end cuisine or because it has specialty imported products. It doesn't embody either of those things. Vegan and Juice is family run community service. These people work hard to bring healthy vegan food to people that want or need it.,This also isn't the kind of place you go to just once. Rather it is the kind of place you continue to visit because you know deep down that their yummy delicious food somehow resonated with what your body was really craving."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/11/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Few times I can find a vegan cafeteria in Miami worth re visiting. Vegan and juice is just that! Juices run for 3.75 (traditional apple, mango, orange,,carrot etc) with power juices for 4.50. My favorite is the fat burner (grapefruit apple pineapple). ,Wraps and sandwiches are avail within the 6-7 dollar range, all mostly a tofu based sandwich. I have also heard many good things about their pizza Thursdays (3$ a slice). ,As I'm sitting here writing this I have just consumed a yuca puff (filled with spinach mushrooms peppers and tomatoes), so good no time for a picture. Menu changes daily to reflect 8-10 specialty dishes. Special of the day includes 4 vegan sides all for a total of $8.50,They have a variety of vegan and gluten free deserts including various cakes, cupcakes, ice cream, cookies-even pastelitos ,Service is fast efficient and always friendly. Very comforting to see the same faces frequently who know what you want and how you want it. I cannot praise this place enough :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/5/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This place is awesome and the avocado wrap is as good as it sounds. I highly recommend this place for all you vegan needs.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/3/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Easily the best vegan restaurant in south florida! I come here whenever I get the chance. The avocado wrap is 2 die 4. The smoothies are perfectly sweet. The hot food is my favorite, you rarely see the same two dishes and they're all very creative, innovative meals. Staff is super friendly. The desserts are deliciously decadent. I've never had a problem with this place (aside from the fact that my inner environmentalist despises all the plastic and styrofoam used, but a vegan diet is pretty green so I suppose that cancels out the waste). Can't say enough great things about this place!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/25/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is fantastic. When you first enter, people are always hesitant to try the food because it's not your regular vegan food, but do it anyway! I love plantains so everything they do with them is always fantastic. Their juices are also delicious and nutritious. I always want beets in my juice as a pick me up and I love the reggae and recover. Their desserts are also to die for! My favorite is the tangerine, but they're all so good!! Be bold and check them out, you won't regret it!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/26/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is a godsend in this area. The food is incredibly delicious, I'm not even a big vegan eater. The juices and smoothies are so fresh and the prices are great."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/12/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Can I please have a moment of silence for this gem!!!!! Totally in love with this vegan restaurant. First time coming and for sure it would not be my last! Specially when it's located so close to the FIU engineer campus! I ordered the eggplant lasagna  with cabbage and sweet potato mashed! Perfect combination of colors, flavors, amounts! I also order a juice so I can complement my amazing lunch! If you're coming on a Saturday make sure you come before 4 since they do close earlier! I noticed that the a big portion of people that was siting around me where elder, which is good! That tells me that they feel at home eating here! Also a lot athletes come here!!. Even if you're not vegetarian, you should definitely come and try it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/27/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"So good!!! This little hole in the wall is one of the very best vegan places I've ever been to. It's super homey, and the customer service is on point. All the juices here are ,. Try the avocado wrap; it's heaven in wrap form. They also have a hot entree area, which I haven't tried yet, but it smells amazing. It's not the cheapest place, but considering all their ingredients are natural and wholesome, it's worth the price. Check them out!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/29/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Such a teeny tiny space that packs a punch of awesome vegan food! Everyday they have a new menu but they also have the their usual favorites. Did I mention it's all decently priced??? And they have pizza Wednesdays! Its first come first serve :) And it's conveniently located near FIU so I can pick up some food after class! Great, delicious, and healthy food!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/6/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Outstanding restaurant! Wonderful service, even more wonderful food. Very reasonable pricing. Never a disappointment when I come into Vegan and Juice! :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/18/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Excellent customer service. Plenty of flavors and options. Price is on point. Juices, wraps, sweeties and nice cooked food. It doesn't get better than this. This place is a good example that vegan food doesn't have to be boring or expensive. I wish I lived closer."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/14/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Went in with my mom to get some authentic vegan food which is hard in Miami. Had the veggie wrap and hummus pie which was fantastic. Also the spinach taqueria were incredible. Would come here again !!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/9/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is the best vegan spot in Miami! I am so thrilled I found this place on yelp. Everyone was amazing friendly and sweet and took care of us without any trouble. The homemade food that they have prepared is so delicious and their made to order juices are so refreshing.

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/4/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Went for lunch for the first time today and simply stated, fantastic.  Food was delicious and pretty unique compared to other vegan restaurants.  Simple ordering, pick 4 of the 6 or so dishes, or a wrap, maybe add a juice, and you're set.  We had two of the entree pick 4, a juice, and a smoothie for about $30 so very affordable.  Price and selection plus the flavor, they've got all three.  Highly recommended, vegan or not."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/13/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"My very first experience with vegan meals, and boy was I pleasantly surprised! ,For starters the menu is updated daily and although it's a lil drive for me, it's totally worth it. ,I had the egg plant lasagna, malanga, mixed veggies and brown rice. ,Ok so the malanga was the most delicious thing I've ever had in my LIFE! The lasagna was great and so were the mixed veggies! ,If you come during the lunch time rush, be prepared to miss certain items on the menu, when they're out they are out.,Enjoy!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/22/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Fresh food made daily, lots of variety, and delicious!  I can't believe their desserts are vegan because they are decadent. I highly recommend this place."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/21/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is officially the best vegan food in Miami! Francisco and his crew are the hippest and healthiest Latin peeps I've ever encountered. The food is abundant, mouthwatering and super affordable. For less than $10 you can have a complete cooked meal with 4 items. They also make fresh wraps and salads cut and prepared right before your eyes. And let's not leave behind their signatures juices : Energy, Flu Blaster, Leafy Lemonade and a parade of other tantalizing combos. Dessert you said? Cupcakes, carrot cake, mandarin cake and cinnamon rolls are only a few of the sweet, animal free goodies you can choose from. ,If it's your first visit, go before noon or after 2 because lunch hour can be chaotically busy and you'll be waiting in line for a bit. They are also open on Saturdays. ,Enjoy this culinary gem!!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/10/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is probably my top three favorite food spots in Miami.  I cannot believe that the deserts are vegan because of how tasty they all are.  This is vegan food with a latin influence and boy is it delish.  The prices for the food being vegan are extremely reasonable.  Today I began a meal plan which Vegan & Juice offers that is five meals for about $8 each!  This is unheard of for quality, freshness, and tasty food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/17/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but delicious vegan food (I'm not even a vegan). It's family owned and the staff is so friendly. The hot food they serve daily is always fresh and tasty. They also make wraps, hummus, and smoothies - all great."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/20/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"A family owned Dominican vegan place located in a old mall in the 107 and flagler.  Simple place, small entrance and nothing fancy inside.  They offer salads, wraps and juices, but their true specialty is the vegan cantina. For around 10 usd you can choose four plates from the daily options prepared. The menu varies, and portions have good size. You can find options ranging from dsily soup, quinoa, vegetables, veggie lasagna, stuffed plantains, stuffed peppers, red beans and several other creations depending on the day.,If you are not in the mood for the cantina you can always ask for a special salad or wrap. Their mix of juices is excellent too. ,At lunch time place is always full. They have around 6 or 8 tables and a bar. The staff is friendly and attentive, the  locals that come here do so several days a week. The ambiance is good.  ,If you have any question about food or ingredients they will answer al your doubts and questions.  They sell also some natural supplements.,Great place for healthy food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/26/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Best vegan place I have been to in Miami so far. Healthy food and a lot of choices. this a small family owned business but the food is homemade and delicious.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/1/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"My first time here and I had to comment on the amazing customer service, cleanliness, and the amazing vegan food. There's not much vegan places around in this area, but I am so happy I found this family owned vegan restaurant. The green juice I got was delicious and fresh and the food is made fresh everyday. It's as if I cooked it at home myself, the food is true Home Vegan cooking and you can't help but get a homie feel while eating it. Get the lunch special, it is super filling and great taste with every bite. I am coming back every time I have an opportunity for lunch from FIU."

I don't know much for vegan/vegetarian options so i OBVIOUSLY yelped my little heart away. just my luck, theres a vegan place (with good ratings) near by. ,we got there around 4pm and they had sold out on majority of the hot foods so all they had to offer were wraps. i had the avocado wrap and my friend had the hummus wrap with added quinoa. ,you can tell everything was fresh. i want to go back to try the hot food and some of the juices."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/4/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Delicious vegan food and juices! Super close to FIU and very affordable. I always get the avocado mambo wrap, it is delicious. All their food is amazing, i definitely recommend it."

Its family owned, when you walk in they greet you so warmly, you feel at home. The have the most delicious variety of vegan foods and desserts. They offer a daily special, for $9 you can pick 4 items from the menu, but not to worry...the menu changes every single day. Everything is delicious trust Me! Juices & Smoothies are great too, and if you want to customize your own, you definitely can. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/19/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I've been coming here since I've been Vegan  (over 3 years) the food is delicious.. homemade cooking, juices, smoothies ugh I'm in heaven here! I always drop in at least for just a delicious slice of vegan pie for under $4!! ,The prices are amazing as well as the staff.. it feels like family everytime I go. Thanks for always being the best vegan restaurant I've come to ear at so far... nothing compares!! I love Vegan & Juice!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/11/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Even if your not vegetarian/vegan you will love this place!!! I'm a student at fiu and this is the most delicious, reasonably priced vegan food around. It's soooo nice to have a place make food with Latin flavors that I can eat! You can get a completa (4 choices of their daily specials that are constantly changing) for just 8 dollars. Their juices are amazing, my favorite is the leafy lemonade (juice of kale, lemon, and apple). From the fixed menu they have, I'm obsessed with the avocado mambo wrap SOOO FLAVORFUL. The food is healthy and leaves you feeling great. ,Everyone that works there is SO SWEET. They are all amazing and do a great job. Keep it up"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/1/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This has become my new favorite place in Miami ! I am so blessed that my boyfriend has moved 2 minutes away from this place I can just roll here or maybe even go twice a day whenever I want ... I usually get the hot bar food but I'm just a broke college student I swear everything looks delicious id buy it all if I could all at once and have a heavenly feast. Ive only tried the mamey, strawberry, pineapple (I think) smoothie but it was so good I can't stop getting it, it tastes like candy I'm scared to get anything else. They press the juices in front of you and make the salads and wraps in front of you in a bar style area. There's also limited seating in the back. Come early !!! It's first come first serve for hot food and trust me you don't want to miss the hot food. Options change daily so I'm never bored of going there. I actually find it super fun guessing what's gonna be on the menu that day, it's huge portions for extremely cheap. It's your favorite food from your Hispanic mom or dad but vegan style !! The staff is extremely friendly makes you feel like you just walked into a family's home ! I love seeing vegan places so packed even with so many non vegan people ! Great food like the one from here is what we need so people can see that it's possible to go vegan and eat good. Not the weird gross cold plant stuff I usually experience. I Will forever keep coming here"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/4/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I eat at Vegan and Juice for a lunch at least two times a week. ,The food always tastes great, their staff is very nice all the time, and the portions are filling. ,Definitely try it out!"

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/18/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I've been living near FIU for for a year now and Vegan and Juice is hands down my favorite vegan spot. It's tiny and cluttered inside, but I guess that can be typical of Miami - a bunch of tiny shops stuffed into one shopping center. The food is perfection - tastes like fresh, homemade, cruelty-free, real food. And I always get a juice - 5 bucks is nothing for a fresh juice that they make right there in front of you. The styrofoam cup they're served in isn't the cutest, but at least it's not plastic so I guess it's better for the environment this way. The empanadas are good but different, don't expect the typical fried dough, it's more bready and baked it seems? Still tasty, though. Everything is good, just go here."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/14/2017,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"I'm not vegan but I really wanted to try this place out since I live close by. The reviews were phenomenal. I arrived past 3 and by that time most of the Today's special menu was gone with about 3 things left. I opted for the avocado wrap that everyone raves about. It's good and tasty. Very fresh. I probably would give this place another shot (much earlier) for their special of the day foods. The staff is very friendly. Family run business which is nice. ,Value wise I think it's okay. It's a little on the pricey side. Almost $8 for the wrap. I get I'm paying for quality but it is veggies..."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/29/2016,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Love this place! I've been trying to reduce my overall meat intake and dedicating two days of the week to be fully plant based and that's what led me to look for this place. This is an all natural, all organic, plant-based, vegan friendly, vegetarian friendly whole in the wall. Every morning they make lots of different dishes and they run out super quick! Everything is fresh and home made. If you don't get there early enough they have a regular menu filled with delicious wraps, salads, smoothies, and juices. ,The ambiance isn't the nicest but the staff and service make up for it. They are all extremely attentive and so warm and welcoming. I really feel at home here. Best of all are the prices!! So worth it, I wouldn't say it's cheap but you definitely get your money's worth and it for sure is less expensive than other vegan juice bars.,I had the curry tofu wrap with hummus and the ABC juice (Apple, Beets, Carrots). I also tried a veggie empanada which was also great. ,I also love the fact that they aren't stingy!! The portions are very filling."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/31/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Family owned vegan restaurant. Small and quaint but the food is delicious. Healthy option for lunch.

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/2/2018,$,4,Vegan & Juice,Great vegan place. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but it was good change to not have meat with my food.  Try the guacamole!

Honey is stolen from bees..,Other than that, im vegan myself and its so amazing that they have this hidden gem. Its really hard to find vegan places in Miami, this is the first ive seen that is totally vegan. i had the Avocado Tofurkey wrap and it was AMAZING. especially the pink sauce they add!!! Also had a smoothie, really natural and refreshing. Super friendly staff! Will DEFINTELY GO BACK. RECOMMEND"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/22/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan food is YUMMY.,The reluctant meat-lover in me finally visited Vegan & Juice after having heard great things about it. Thanks to this place, the meat-lover in me has now become open to vegan options.,This place is a family-run whole-in-the-wall....and it's absolutely wonderful. You'll be able to choose from hot foods and a variety of wraps and a few other options. Note: a lot of the hot food runs out by mid/late afternoon. On my visit, I arrived at 3pm, so most of the hot food was gone. Regardless, I tried what was left.,An awesome thing is that they let you sample the hot foods. I ordered two servings of what was left because the sample blew me away. To be honest, even though the employee repeated the name of this dish several times to me, I still don't know what it's called. Sorry fellow yelpers - but point is: it was hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious!,I also tried my boyfriend's avocado mambo wrap. I was ultra-reluctant about trying the wrap because I was ultra-doubtful that a wrap could taste good without any meat. I was wrong; it was downright delicious.,The food got me full and I felt incredibly satisfied after. Service was fantastic and prices were decent. I will absolutely undoubtedly be back."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/2/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"A complete twist on what you consider a savory lunch spot with a vegan twist. From Malanga Pastelon to a huge variety of freshly squeezed juices and wraps- this place proves that vegan can indeed be indulgent while not breaking the bank. It's located in a strip mall right by FIU & I suggest getting here early because once they run out if an item- they are out of it for the day. Check their Instagram for their daily menu which is released at around 11am. I shared the daily special which was a vegan pastelon, okra, and a garbanzo dish along with the avocado mambo wrap (I added tofu). I decided to get the grape juice which blew my mind! Its just pure grapes ! There's no filler! It tasted like heaven ! The Dominicans running this got it down pact and while there might be a wait to be served, your body will thank you in every way. Having vegan options allows your body to breathe from all the toxins we invest daily. I'm so happy I found this place. Oh, and the price beats all those hipster spots that serve you half the portion and charge you double the price. Try to avoid the lunch crowd and come a bit early. Please get the grape juice, you'll be glad you did!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/5/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,I am not a Vegan but i wanted to try something different and healthy and Man did i make a great choice. The staff was so welcoming and the food was so delicious. i would definitely come back again.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/8/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Everything is so yummy that I forget that it is vegan (not that it's a bad thing). The point is, anyone can really enjoy the food here and it is very affordable. ,I guess people think that eating healthy and more organic has to be expensive. Not the case here. For under $10 I have myself a super delicious and nutritious lunch. I have been here a few times during lunch, and just wish it was a bit closer. ,The lunch special allows you to choose 4 items from their daily specials. Today I had the quinoa, beans, tofu and baked sweet potato tart. It was all very yummy and filled me up real quick. I ordered a zucchini cake to-go (for my afternoon snack). ,They are pretty busy, but the line moves quick because the foods are prepared in a buffet style where the ladies serve you from. A lot of people come in and sit by the counter bar or towards the back where they have small tables up to 4 people. Hope to be back soon!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/1/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Amazing authentic Caribbean vegan food with a green juice and smoothy bar! they run out of food every day. It's that good! Had the special of the day. Asked for a second meal to go for dinner later . It's that good !
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/18/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"What a great Yelp find in Miami! Vegan yummy food, and you don't have to be vegan to enjoy. The juices are delicious and super fresh. The wrap and salad also with super fresh veggies and lots of flavor. The strawberry vegan cake was the cherry on top :) the place is not pretty and it's in a non pretty shopping but it's great and totally worth visiting.( Also very inexpensive )"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/9/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Please get non-styrofoam containers! I love the food here. It's so nice to find something healthy even though I'm not Vegan.  But it disappointing to find place especially a vegan place that uses styrofoam.,I've had the tofurkey wraps and got the $8.50 hot plate that had 4 items. The okra, zucchini boats, spinach wrap and yucca pastel were amazing. Very flavorful!,The banana cake was good, not amazing though"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/10/2017,$,3,Vegan & Juice,"It's hard for me to review a place like Vegan & Juice because I'm not Vegan, and I generally don't like Vegan food, so anyone reading this review should keep this in mind.,Vegan & Juice is a spot tucked into the shopping plaza next to La Nonna and Spice N' Curry, it's a cafeteria-style setup with some dining, where upon entering, there's a line to where you can choose 1 of about 8 different ""dishes"", some of which are sides, and others which seem more like a meal. These are all vegan dishes. Today, they had items like Basmati Rice (good), Yucca, Eggplant Parmesan, and a Pepper stuffed with some vegetables. I enjoyed the Basmati rice, it was good. The Yucca was also good, but I did not enjoy the flavors of the Eggplant Parmesan or the stuffed peppers. ,The meal was around $8 for my food, which is above average for lunch prices, but probably pretty cheap for vegan food. They offer some dessert options, but they're typical restaurant dessert prices of around $4-$5. I find this place intriguing because it's something that the area doesn't offer, and it appeals to a certain demographic. I can't say I enjoyed it, or I was enticed to ever come here again, because it doesn't appeal to me. It might appeal to me better if there were ""traditional"" food options, just prepared in a vegan way, but this place is not it. This place was very busy, so I'm sure that the vegans do enjoy this spot. There's no ""service"" here per say, because it's just the person giving you your food. Overall, decent.,3*"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/27/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan food with sazón! These Dominican ladies call me mami and feed me the most flavorful veggies I've ever had! For $8.99 you get ""the meal of the day"" which includes 4 sides of your choice, all made fresh that day with that Dominican love. And for me, it's enough for two meals. The eggplant lasagna, my word!!! And the large fresh juices for just $5. Let's not forget the vegan gluten free desserts. It's like homemade food made my momma for a great price! The only thing...the styrofoam kills me. Plastic, something recyclable, anything but styrofoam. I think it's just a matter of the customers asking them to transition...so help me out?! But the food and service is just YUM!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/5/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my year of being vegan. Their food tasted like home cooked food & the service was the epitome of Hispanic excellence and a unique welcoming ambiance.

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/25/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan & Juice is a small local eatery. They have all fresh and vegan food, wraps, juices, smoothies and desserts that will blow your taste buds.,The tiny restaurant has been in place for 16 years. The main treat here is their food canton that is sold out after lunch (~2pm). Now, don't let that stop you from coming. Their wraps are huge, and I've only tried their Avocado Mamabo which rocks. Now, if you are really here to be blown away - go ahead and order a slice of carrot cake. You'll never think that Publix one was any good! ,Their banana and strawberry smoothies are delicious, and their watermelon juice the bomb. I go to school at FIU Engineering, just across the street, and enjoy coming here often and seeing all of the familiar faces. Their customer service is always friendly and stellar!"

I (if you have noticed in my reviews) just like trying a lot of different things. ,I really found this place good. I am not sure how you give 1/2 stars but this place is a strong 4.5. It's a small establishment and the choice of items is limited- so I can only say more choices and a more descriptive way to know what is available. ,I'm a risk taker, but others want to see the choice and not have to ask about everything available. ,Great service and patience with a new customer. The beets, broccoli, potato dish- all were excellent. Even if I can't tell you the names of everything i ate. ,Give it a try."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/25/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Delicious food and I'm not a big fan of vegan food. I like that it's family owned and they're super nice. They've even helped my family take things to the car before when their hands were full.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/14/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is a gem. Tried the avocado wrap with hummus and it was absolutely delicious. The fat burner juice which consisted of apple, pineapple and grapefruit, amazing! The hot food looked even better and all vegan which is obviously a bonus. I highly recommended, I am definitely coming back."

Great wine selection and many veggie and vegan options, but all the meats/poultry/fish as well. Has an artsy feel with beautiful paintings,, they offer wine and painting nights one Tuesday a month,,, loved it! Great for family lunch/dinner or even for a romantic date, don't think it twice!"
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/12/2016,$$,4,LOUI,"Loui offers a great mix of Italian and American food in a cozy, rustic location on Miracle Mile.  I the food to be generous and the taste to be above average.  I had a statement from a coworker that the food was served a bit on the cold side.  Nothing that should ruin it for you.  When I went the restaurant was pretty much empty so it was a little surprising to see a slow down in service toward the end of the meal.  Also keep in mind that the vegan risotto may not be available on Mondays.  I love the quinoa salad and the porcini mushroom risotto.  Didn't make it to dessert but I'm sure they are wonderful.  It's a relatively new face in the Coral Gables/Miracle Mile scene and certainly deserves a chance."
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/22/2017,$$,5,LOUI,"Great place for a relaxing afternoon or evening. We ate the vegan risotto, salmon tartar, and quinoa salad. All I can say is DELICIOUS! Great service and ambiance. Beautifully decorated. Great place to celebrate specially occasions as well. A definite Must Try!"
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/12/2017,$$,4,LOUI,"Stopped by with a group of 10 people. Service was prompt, owner was attentive to our needs. Tasted several items on the menu including the mushroom risotto, pesto linguine, and vegan ceviche. Decent, but not the best. Risotto was a bit on the bland side, linguine needed a bit more pesto, and the vegan ceviche was a bit overpriced for what you're getting. ,Overall, a quaint little spot with a solid wine list and a menu that will appeal to most. Nicely decorated, would make a great place for date night."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/17/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"God bless this place. A hidden gem in Miami, I'd come to eat here once because I had a sensitive stomach that day and was recovering from the flu. I'm not vegan, but I figured if any place was going to have healthy food that was good for me this was a good fit. Today was my second visit a year later and the quality has not changed. It's still a friendly, warm atmosphere where customers know the staff and each other.,I got the 4 sides lunch special. It was filling and DELICIOUS! The place advertises itself as Vegan Latin Cuisine, and that's exactly what it delivers. It tastes like your or your friends Mami made it. The menu is creative and whatever sides you get compliment each other.,Latin restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city, but this is the first that is designed with a meatless menu. The juice bar is also out of this world. Good places like this are an endangered breed in this city - this is not a place to be missed."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/16/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I am in no way a vegan but if all vegan food tasted like this I could be. This place is so bomb. I decided to try it because it is close to my job and the yelp reviews were great. Every day they have different specials and everything I've tried is outstanding (lentil soup, okra, mushrooms, squash, red beans, salad). The lunch is about $8 and you can choose any 4 items including any of their hot specials, side salad or guacamole. Everything has wonderful flavor, the service is great and friendly and it is reasonably priced- especially for vegan food. I recommend to get there early because the two times I've been around 1:30 pm they are already sold out of some of their specials. ,Highly recommend- vegan or not!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/28/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Who knew vegan food could be so yummy? With generous portion sizes for only $8 you can get 1 meal that will last you for lunch and dinner. Better than any delivery meal plan out there. Soups here are delicious, my favorite is the pumpkin! ,Staff here are friendly,  you can dine in at the juice bar or at a table. The restaurant is pretty small and can get busy. ,If you want to get started on a healthy eating plan, this is a great economical way to do it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/15/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"The first time I wandered in here I looked at the menu and left without anything. Lets face it for all the non super healthy eaters out there like myself - vegan food doesn't sound or sometimes look the most appetizing. ,Fast forward a few months this is my go to spot for healthy, tasty lunch. You can order fresh juices, a number of different wraps, soups and there's a daily lunch buffet too - thats my go to. You can choose 4 different dishes for under $9.00. ,What a deal for the quality of food you get. ,Love this place."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/24/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Best place to hit up for a juice if you don't have a juicer, when you need brain food and recharge your human body, GET THE AVOCADO MAMBO WRAP with no humus... Oh my lord... SOOOOO GOOD. You will easily spend $30 in there, but if you can splurge do it, if you can't stick to the wrap and a juice, a juice can be between 4- 6 bucks (small- large). The small salad is completely worth it and the green juice is an amazing combo of all you need in nutrient, the vegan brownie is a must!  Yes you might have to wait, for the demand is larger then the amount of people there are in taking orders and working blenders etc, none the less worth the wait, also be aware that it is a small hole in the wall, with a lot of charm, quick tip you can always call in and order for the hot food ahead of time and pick up, the food goes quick, be there by 11 a.m. or miss out lol selections get fewer."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/31/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,By far one of the BEST vegan places I've been to! The food was super yummy!!!! Highly recommend!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/2/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan & Juice is awesome and is near the top of my list of places to eat in Miami. While it may be tempting to pre-judge vegan food as tasteless, this is not the case at Vegan & Juice. Also, I'm not a vegan.,The first time I came here, I was blown away by how good vegan food could be because I like pretty much all the food that I've tried here which can change from day to day. Even their daily soups are great. Taste, seasoning, texture.. all on point especially for vegan food. I also like their wraps such as the Avocado Mambo Wrap or the Veggie Tofurky Wrap. Everything is fresh and made to order. If you come at the right time, you can see the owner hauling in all of the produce daily.,The juices are freshly blended right in front of you. They have a wide variety of blended and non-blended juices to choose from. I usually get the Flu Blaster which has real ginger in it and then add some strawberries to it.,The service here at Vegan and Juice is always great. Feels like family. They recognize you on your repeat visits. One lady in particular always welcomes me out loud with open arms which always makes my day. Last time, she mixed me up with some other Asian guy, but it's all good and I don't blame her. We all look alike.,The prices are reasonable. When I visit Vegan & Juice with my gf, we usually order a full meal, a wrap, a soup, and 2 juices and the bill usually comes out to the mid $30 range which is hard to beat. They also don't expect any tips when they run your credit card. Does that mean you should not tip?? Of course not!,My only issue with Vegan & Juice is that I don't live closer to it because I could eat here every day."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/1/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Picture this: You stumble upon a shopping center with a combination of the most random restaurants, a bank, and a banquet hall. You walk into Vegan and Juice and are greeted by friendly faces (bilingual btw), half the restaurant is the seating area the other half if the serving area. It is mostly vegan, there are some items you can get like honey in a smoothie or cheese on an eggplant lasagna, BUT the servers always ask you so if you are vegan do not fear! Very respectful and kind staff! Incredible carrot cupcakes and brownies, taste like heaven! Also, if you're sick they have a special ginger lemon Drink that works miracles. I love this place, I go often, and I'm never disappointed by the quality of food. I recommend the lunch special and replacing one of the sides with a soup for the best value! Trust me, the soup is always great so you're not missing out!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/7/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"What's not to love about this place!? It's run by a very nice Dominican family so you know the food is bomb. Everything from their juices, smoothies, wraps, soups, salads, home style comfort vegan food and desserts are all EXCELLENT. You can't go wrong when you eat here. Everyone I've brought always enjoys their food. ,I suggest that you come early if you want in on the hot bar cooked food because they start running short by noon (they open at 10am, Monday - Saturday). They post their daily menu options on their Instagram (@veganandjuice) so you can call ahead and order or just drop in and order in person. They occasionally have some non-vegan dishes that includes regular cheese so be sure to ask. ,All in all, I love this little gem that's tucked away in Sweetwater and try to come as often as I can. I highly recommend you check it out if you haven't already."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/27/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I absolutely loved my experience here!!! It was my first time, and the woman who was serving the hot meals, was so nice, helpful, and welcoming. I had their yellow lentils suffle, spinach and tofo, squash and carrot mix, and the green plantain puff. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. I just started getting into vegan meals and this food honestly changed my perspective on how creative you can get with plant based foods. The staff had a smile on their faces, welcomed me in, and it was an overall amazing atmosphere. ,See you soon Vegan & Juice!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/17/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This is my favorite vegan spot ever! The food & smoothies are phenomenal. I go to FIU & this little spot is convenient for me to have lunch. I enjoy coming here when I get the chance. The staff is wonderful & very welcoming. They treat all their customers like family. I'm so happy to have found this place & will forever keep coming back.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/30/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Filling, delicious, cheap, healthy, and home-made! I love every visit I make to this place because they have new dishes everyday. The very sweet Dominican family knows how to make vegan food with flavor. I have been here many times for the hot meals, but make sure you come or order before 1:30pm! That's around when the warm, fresh dishes run out. My favorites are the eggplant lasagna, spinach tacos, zucchini / squash, and any of their souffles. ,If you're craving a dessert while you're there, their vegan key lime pie makes me melt whenever I order it. It has a distinct coconut flavor and you can't go wrong with it. I believe they are opening a new location soon in Doral, so I can't wait to see what they start doing there too!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/5/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Awesome food and great fruit drinks. Small place but a gem. You have to try especially if you are a vegan.  The hot vegan food is amazing. Staff is so friendly. It's like having a family meal.
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/12/2017,$$,5,LOUI,"Excellent food. VEGAN OPTIONS MUCH APPRECIATED!! And they are on seamless! This place is a lifesaver for delivering a gorgeous and delicious meal for my family and me. Our group included both plant-based to animal-based eaters and were all able to order and enjoy what we needed. They have delicious healthy risottos and burgers made from vegetables--as well as risottos and burgers made from sea animals and cows, if eating animals is your thing. An extra star for how lovingly the meal was packed.  Everything clearly labeled with little drawings and everything. Thanks to them!  A beautiful meal."
"1104 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/22/2017,$$,5,Yuzi Yakitori,"This was our first time in Miami, and we found this restaurant on Yelp.  The food is just terrific, and the service was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal--something for dinner everyone!  We have three generations and a vegan, and everyone was happy.  The wait staff is incredible, all the  dishes were superb.  Highly recommend."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",7/18/2017,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Yes. Yum. Thank you, Ghee, for bringing conscientious diversity to Miami. Farm fresh, local food, organic and sustainable wines, and plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free offerings. This night started with attentive service from Gabriel at the bar. His suggestions and explanations unfolded the menu for my husband and I like the petals on a lotus. The night ended with a delicious cake by pastry chef Alex, whose palette is clearly something exceptional. Everything in between was flawless. We will be back. ,...and we came back. Sooo yummy again. We had more yummy veggie offerings while our friends raved about the lamb. Service and food were immaculate -again. Alex (pastry chef) recognized us from a couple nights ago and personally greeted us. This time dessert was the date cake and Benin a cake. ***spoiler alert: these desserts will give you cravings and cause you to return."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",4/8/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Farm to table food. Delicious!  Have been there a few times and the food has always been excellent. The service is fantastic. The menu denotes gluten free, vegan and vegetarian choices."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",2/22/2018,$$,4,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"We came on a busy Saturday evening, and snagged the last two chairs at the bar (no reservation needed there!) between two friendly groups who were happy to adjust a bit so we could all have our elbow space. The decor is lovely, and while the restaurant was loud, everyone was friendly and welcoming. The menu is also incredibly GF and vegan friendly, so we have an immediate go-to when our dietarily restricted friends come to visit!,Truly great service from Gabriel this past weekend. We would visit again and sit at the bar just so we could say hi. The SO is a chatter, so I think he liked having someone to talk it up with. Gabriel had great suggestions for us based on what was fresh from their Homestead farm, and when he heard I appreciated a hearty spice, he brought by a sample of their house marinated chiles to try. Our waters were kept filled, and we had a great view of the chefs at work. To note, dishes came out at an interesting pace (we got there and ordered after our neighbors and received literally every dish before they did).,Now for the food - it was all worth a try, though some plates were a bit of a letdown in terms of flavor and straight Americanized-fusion nonsense. Let's start with my least favorite of the night - the ghost pepper-cheesy naan. Just don't get it. One, if you ordered it for any spice flavor, there is none. It's straight up just damp, cheesy naan. Paired with my curry, it was not the right flavor or texture. I stole my SO's garlic naan instead - much better and perfectly garlicky as one would expect.,Then the papadum. Normally a salty, crispy starter that you would dip in a sweet chutney (or for me, the spicy sauce), it was placed in front of us fully topped like a giant nacho. A tomato salsa-like chutney was all you could see. And taste. And that's just...not what I wanted or expected. But I still ate it.,And the pork belly vindaloo. If there's a vindaloo or a jalfrezi, no matter what else is on the menu, that's going in my belly - at any Indian restaurant or home. Especially one that is inspired by Western Indian dishes. Here, while the pork belly was generous, the flavor was missing something special. Also, a noticeable lack of fiery kick despite there being scotch bonnets on the ingredient list. (No substitutions or additions on the curries, as they are made the day of and stewed for hours).,After all my negativity, you must be wondering where the four stars come from (or maybe not). The lamb shank biryani was a redeemer. Flavorful, generous, a pomegranate crunch, and just all around wonderful. We would order it again without a doubt. The SO also had the grilled sweet corn and the poriyal (again, fresh from the farm). It was incredible how the chefs were able to transform simple ingredients like lima beans and lentils into something so flavorful and filling.,In the end, Ghee really shines with their simple and farm-to-table dishes. I'm ready to order one of every vegetable dish on the menu, and hesitate on the curries. What I'm most excited about is if/when they start hosting like, giant family dinners on their production farm. That would be a big treat to see just where my dinner came from."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/22/2012,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is fantastic! They have lots of vegetarian and some vegan options which is sometimes hard to find. The ambiance of this little cafe was so zen; a perfect lunch spot after a crazy morning. I had the homemade hummus, lentil soup and the veggie quesadilla. All were delicious and came out pretty quickly for this hungry girl. Definitely a place to check out!"
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",6/23/2018,$$,3,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Ambience is great, in Miami's Design District. Food is served as shareable. While prices off the menu look cheap, consider yourself warned that portions are small. For an Indian restaurant, I was surprised to find that there weren't that many well rounded options here in terms of protein for us vegans. Most likely won't be back."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/6/2014,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"The pizza is great and delicious. The meatballs are great also. The place is not big, but have space indoor and outdoor. The problem is that the waitress service isnt that good, they are very slow. They have little selection of craft beer, if you like the Ale, try the Monk in the trunk. Also they have pizza for vegan and vegetarian people. Overall is a good place for lunch, but if you are short of time, ask for delivery."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/6/2013,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I've been to Lemoni Café twice and had a wonderful experience both times. The food and service were excellent. The place itself is small but very cute and cozy. It's perfect for an outing with a group of friends or a date night with your significant other. My first visit I ordered the special of the day which was steak with pesto and mashed potatoes; it was delicious! My second visit I ordered the soup of the day (Lentil) and a smoked salmon panini; both were very tasty. One thing I admire about Lemoni Café is their extensive menu and the fact that they offer a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. The food is excellent and the prices are extremely reasonable/affordable. The service is both friendly and very attentive. I highly recommend Lemoni Cafe, I also recommend Lemoni Pizzeria which is right next door. If you happen to be near Midtown/Wynwood/Design District/Buena Vista you should definitely check out Lemoni."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/5/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"We finally made it out to Lemoni!! It was the husbands idea too, although I've had this little gem bookmarked for years. We arrived on a Sunday at around 5:15pm,  glanced the very extensive menu, and ordered a bottle of wine (it had been a long day). Another couple came in a few minutes after us and asked at what time the place closed and out waiter tells them 6pm as he was pouring my wine. I thought we were going to be rushed out of there, but none at all. The service continued to be as great as if we had arrived hours before closing. Now the food...I am a diehard sandwich lover. I can live off sandwiches for the rest of my life. This place is a panini/sandwich lovers mecca. Lots to choose from, even vegan/veggie options if thats your thing. My husband got his inner vegan on with a black bean burger panini which he devoured. You could tell that the patty was fresh and homemade b/c it had beans coming out of it..I on the other hand ordered the meatball parm sandwich which paired delectably with the Malbec. The meatballs were the perfect size and also fresh tasting.  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other panini options. My advice to any yelpers out there is to remember they close early, 6pm on Sundays. They did turn away a few patrons that arrived at 5 till, so they do mean business!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/20/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Great place! The vegan plate was an amazing option with the most delicious vegan coconut cutlets served with vegan mozarella.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/4/2015,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"Good decor, many vegan options and perfect for a low key first date"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/16/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"INCREDIBLE!!! I cannot believe this is my first time coming here, and I'm so glad I did because this is now my new favorite little cafe here in Miami. You will not be disappointed by the vegan options. In fact, I dare say it's one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had in Miami! I had the vegan cutlet sandwich with a side salad and a smoothie. AMAZING! Amazing service, casual and quaint ambiance, and an overwhelming large selection of vegan options. I'm definitely a fan and will be returning soon!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/19/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Best food!!! Omg!! If you are vegan or vegetarian this place is over the top !! We had soo many choices..we for sure over ordered..everything was amazing..we had several salads..soup ..hummus ..sandwich which was made of coconut heaven..tiny place!! Excellent service..reasonable prices..for sure coming back
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/15/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place never fails. Food and service is ALWAYS GREAT! Vegan options, must try paninis!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/12/2014,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is pretty awesome so far.  Great menu, service has been good, and food has been great.  Plan on returning many times.  The Sunday meatball parm is very good.  They even have multiple vegan options."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/1/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Love dining at Lemoni Cafe! Hands down the best service in Miami. The servers treat you like family and always have a sense of calm even when they get quite busy. The food is outstanding as well, their menu is extensive and has options for everyone omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan alike. I myself am vegan and highly recommend the coconut breaded tofu panini with 3 bean salad, but everything I've tried in the last 4 years has been excellent!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/28/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Excellent excellent! The staff was really friendly and knowledgeable about vegan food! I had a Veggie Quesadilla that was extremely tasty! With a vegan mozzarella that tasted better then regular mozzarella. Def recommend!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/14/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place deserves a 5 simply because of how unique the restaurant is as a whole. My cousin was living in Midtown for some time, and we would always order from this cafe. The food was always fresh but the wait sometimes was a bit long. Although I must admit, I am a fond advocate that if the food is amazing, I will wait a bit more time for an amazing meal. I would always order the chicken salad!!! So much flavor! Everything is spectacular! They have a huge selection for vegan and vegetarians which is the best!!! Since I don't eat that much meat! I promise you, this place will not disappoint! They know what they are doing."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/10/2014,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"I've only ever had food delivered from here through the Yelp app, which uses Eat24 to execute the order. I was very pleased to find they have vegan/vegetarian options right on their menu, so I didn't have to cobble a meal from side dishes like I'm used to doing as a non-cooking vegan!,I chose the Veggie Lover's Panini which was bursting with roasted vegetables, including peppers, mushrooms and eggplant. My fault for forgetting to tell them no cheese, but I was starting to forget (and miss!) the taste of the gooey melted Provolone anyway. I picked chips for the free side of chips or greens, and it came with a small bag of plain Lay's.,Including a $2 delivery fee, my order came out to $11.63 before tip. Considering they were willing to trek all the way to me at The Venetia, I definitely got the better end of that bargain. Great meal, and would order from or visit again!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/20/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"A hidden gem! Casual and eclectic atmosphere, this place looks like it easily doubles as a quirky cafe and lowkey lunch or dinner spot. A huge range of food options, especially for dinner. And many vegetarian/vegan, a big plus. But most importantly, everything my table ordered was excellent. Even something as simple as a chicken wrap was filled with unique and delicious flavors. Other favorites: Hummus, Tabbouleh, Coconut breaded vegan cutlets.,Definitely returning often."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/18/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Great little place with big flavor and vegan options. The house specials that include vegan meatballs and a tofu caprese salad are generous and serious supreme gourmet. They could sell their vegan Parmesan cheese and make a fortune. Bella. I hope that they can expand to the empty retail space next door,"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/27/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"The food is good, the atmosphere is even better! A little hole in the wall in Miami's Mimo District, Lemoni Café really transports you to a little chic European café. And they have amazing vegan options!,Ambiance: I usually start off with food, but this place is really all about the ambiance! The absolute perfect date night spot, especially for a first date (and it's near Wynwood so if you're feeling each other make your way to one of the breweries!). There's so much character in the decor, the colors very rich and warm so you just feel so at ease and comfortable. It's tiny and just down to earth! ,Food: I really liked the food! They have an extensive menu with everything from sandwiches to salads to vegan entrees! Perfect place for vegans & non-vegan friends to come because there is something for everyone! I ordered the Vegan Platter and Jesus! Food for 3 meals easily! Came with quinoa, whole wheat pita, sautéed veggies, hummus, VEGAN MOZZARELLA, strawberries with mint, and coconut meat breaded with oatmeal. Absolutely freaking delicious and super filling! I couldn't get over the vegan mozzarella. My date ordered the chicken quesadilla and he said it was really good too! They don't have a large wine or beer menu, but they have some great craft beers including Dead Guy Rogue which is my absolute favorite! I really wanted their vegan cookies, but they were out. Next door they have a pizzeria with vegan pizza, can't wait to try that!,Overall, cute, quaint, good food, large menu selection, limited wine & beer, and vegan deliciousness! Highly recommend this place for a simple dinner date."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2016,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Cute lil cafe in Midtown, vintage decor and vegan friendly menu! I tried their avocado and sundried tomato pannini with vegan mozzarella cheese and a side salad...wow! this sandwich was soo good and filling! I couldn't finish it all so took the other half home. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The space is very quaint and inviting. I will def be going back to try more of the items on their menu."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/2/2014,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I heard Lemoni Cafe have some vegan options, so after taking my car to have their oil change, I decided to stop here to have my tank fill-up. It was Saturday, lunch time. Parking was a breeze behind their building. Sweet.,The place its charming, really charming, tiny of course, and I really dig their vibe with the Spanish rock playing. The waitress was very helpful with her recommendations, a big plus. They have a menu call Conscious Cuisine, which I found really cool, with an array of vegan pizzas and some other stuff that right now eludes me. ,I ended up having a Portobello Paninni, that comes with a salad and a vegan strawberry cone for dessert. My only complaint. They just carry soy milk (Soy its a big No-No in my book) as an alternative for their coffee. Wouldn't be nice to have almond milk as well, so patrons can have a super yummy almond cappuccino and feel happy? Just a thought.,Overall, I had a great lunch. I will definitely be back, next time with my vegan tribe."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/29/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Probably the smallest cafe in Miami with the biggest menu. You could seriously eat there every day for months and never order the same thing twice. Incredible selection of really well done healthy dishes and many vegan options. This will be my go-to place for take out and delivery as well. Great local cafe feel with very tight limited seating...you will get to know the folks eating next to you. ,The vegan meatballs were amazing, as well as the veggie wrap. Every dish that came out of the kitchen whizzed right by our noses, and they all looked amazing. Portions are large, so didn't make it to dessert. Desserts are home made and looked insanely good.,I would have given it 5 stars, but it was difficult getting our servers attention throughout our brunch. I completely understand that it was a packed Saturday, but there really aren't too many tables, so."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/28/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Great great Vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. They are big also.  I am never to crazy about their soups, they need to improve by a lot and most important, they need to be hotter and less salty.  If you have never been, give this guys a visit. Its a small charming place.,Parking on the street is a bit difficult and in the back they seem to have parking, they only problem is that the gate to the parking lot is sometimes close. ,Anyways, the food is what is more important and the food here is great."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/11/2018,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I enjoyed my lunch here ALOT.  I got the salmon on a fresh whole wheat baguette (note: bakery fresh , not from a bag).  The garlic aioli was delish and the salad was fresh and tasty.  I reserve 5 stars for the super high end amazing experiences - this was pretty great as a lunch place. My friend wasn't happy because her quesadilla had  real cheese, but since they had a vegan quesadilla on the menu and she didn't order it, I have to side with the restaurant.  I don't think it was their fault.  The quesadilla looked very tasty, even though I didn't get to taste it. I like the funky relaxed vibe.  Definitely would come back to try other things in the future."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/15/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I've been a regular for years.  Great quality food and some yummy vegan options.  The BF and I like to come here because there is such a large variety.  You can find something for anyone's craving.  Sometimes you can be waiting a while and seating is a little cramped, but no biggie.  They will also deliver through Eat24."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/10/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"So good. Went for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. The food was fresh and delicious. I had the 2 eggs and home fries. LOVED the home fries! Meal was very filling and reasonably priced. I would love to go back for lunch since the sandwiches sounded interesting. I am a meat eater but the vegan/vegetarian options sounded very appetizing and interesting, not your usual salad only type of meals. The only downside is the parking which was tricky and uncomfortable."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/21/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Awesome little place with fresh wraps and paninis. Soups, appetizers and bites are also good choices. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options on menu too. Owner is super nice.  Small place so you want to get there early of late to mIss the lunch crowd and they do a lot of takeout business as well. Definitely worth going. This was our third or fourth time there, and food never disappoints."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/4/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Wonderful! I ordered via Uber Eats . It is always so Fresh and the preparation is so tasting. I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but I always end up eating a wonderful Vegetarian dish, one of my favorite is the Chickpea & Quinoa Salad avocado, cherry tomatoes, onions, feta, corn, and cilantro. served with toasted ciabatta bread . It's helping my Weight Watcher plan. It's perfect for my 2018 Resolution.  My husband loves their Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich mayo, grilled onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and provolone. your choice of bread and your choice of side.  if you need any changes they will always try to accommodate, great place and great people."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/24/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I love this place. Such healthy ingredients and amazing food. It's so tiny in there though so expect a wait on a busy brunch day. It's always good and the staff is always sweet. I've had so many things on that menu but the black bean burger is so goooooood. Greek salad is awesome. Great choices for vegans and vegetarians. Super cute inside. Like I said, not spacious at all."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/22/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Best restaurant for vegans and non vegans to eat together ! There's a ton of vegan options and cheeses as well as normal food and they have no problem replacing something you see on the menu with a vegan option.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/4/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Not sure what took me so long to ""discover"" Lemoni. Fear of being run over by a Haitian driver perhaps? Ouch. Had to go there. No really, I liked  this charming little cafe and I love that they offer a few vegan options. What they should also add is some gluten-free corn or brown rice tortillas instead of all the wheat breads and wraps. ,My daily special, a grilled faux meatball panini with vegan mozzarella, portabella mushrooms and marinara sauce, was totally delicious. The vegan cheese was actually really good, as was the faux meat made from oats and coconut. Sounds strange, but with the marinara sauce and smoky mushrooms, it worked.,Their dessert offerings are great (brownie a la mode, cheesecake, bread pudding and vegan cupcakes). I am a bread pudding feen. Their cinnamon raisin version with nutella is legit, right up there with Morgan's, Blue Collar and City Hall. And for $6 you get a huge portion. I am not a big fan of raisins and usually prefer some sort of fruit or chocolate in my bread pudding, like Morgan's does. I also didn't notice any nutella in it but overall it was still a very good traditional BP.  I'd pay them a visit just for that (and probably will)."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/10/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Vegan & vegetarian friendly. Great staff & amazing food. You definitely get what you pay for!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I been coming here for a while and I never had an issue. Everything is always delicious, vegan choices, healthy options . Service is usually great The wine are always with a decent price. I really recommend this place"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/19/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is great. I went to eat there with my mother & even though they had a staff meeting inside their restaurant, they still sat us down outside & took care of us. Extremely nice staff. I ordered hummus & pita bread as an appetizer (among other things) & the kind of pita bread they served, was probably the best pita bread I've ever tried. As an entree, I had the vegan quesadillas. I was not disappointed. Definitely a place you have to try for yourself & explore their large menu. There are so many options to choose from."
"8376 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",6/20/2013,$$,4,Kon Chau Restaurant,"Kon Chau dim sum on a lazy afternoon. This place is understated. Heavy traffic at weekend brunch time, but otherwise peaceful. The food is fast, delicious, and inexpensive. A vegetarian (not vegan) and a meat eater will both leave satisfied. The dining area is simple and unpretentious, unlike many Miami 'pan-Asian cuisine' type places. Dreamy dreamy dim sum is the real deal. ,...and my little brother was digging on the smooth sounds of the 70's."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I went here today for the first time at my son's request. He's vegan, so there are a lot of options for him here. We arrived around 2:30pm on a Sunday. There were 4 people ahead of us. There were no seats available. There were seats outside, but we were a party of five and all of the tables are 2-tops and can't be moved around. We waited for almost an hour to be sat. I wasn't too happy about that, but it wasn't the staff's fault. There was a table there with their to-go boxes since we arrived, and they just sat there talking for almost an hour after paying! ,The menu is great. Something for everyone! I have very picky eaters in my family. My husband got a meat empanada that was amazing! Then he had a gyro that was also really good! My son had the Mediterranean platter. It was huge and everything was delicious! He also had an order of the vegan meatballs (it comes with 2). They were super good! We shared a plate of the Home potatoes. They were good. My daughter had a Cesar salad and ate every last bite. I had a portabella mushroom and goat cheese sandwich. It was amazing! I really didn't expect much from the place, but they really make every single item very tasty! I wasn't even that hungry, but I ate the entire sandwich. ,It was also very reasonably priced. We all had waters, but the bill was only $65. My son had a ton of leftovers. ,Even though it's a far drive for me, I'll definitely be back. It was worth the long wait."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Light yet filling, I left feeling brand new! I had the Bean Burger wrap with three bean salad (completely vegan) and was completely satisfied. Even took half of the wrap home. Incredibly affordable, too.,I honestly can't wait to go back and try something else. They have so many great options that cater to any and all dietary needs!,Really great, local ambience. Cute, homey decor. Street parking was pretty easy to find."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/24/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Lemoni Cafe is a charming little spot great for lunch or dinner. Located in Miami Design District's Buena Vista is this beautifully decorated restaurant offering a wide variety of options on the menu to choose from. Take note to the many wonderful vegan and vegetarian options also! The menu is filled with options ranging from small bites, salads, entrés, daily specials, paninis, wraps and so on. Treat yourself to a fresh smoothie or pick from the many different brewed coffee selections. ,Seating was quick which was great for us as some of us had flights to catch that day back to Chicago including myself. We were a group of 5 that came in on a Saturday for an early lunch and we were seated immediately. Upon being seated you are served water infused with fresh mint- very very refreshing. All of us at the table are plant based eaters. We had a wonderful time trying each other's wraps, the vegan quesadillas are really good and so is the caprese sandwich. I had the Tuesday special even though it was Saturday. It was served with a 3 bean salad- very very tasty! ,I would definitely go back to Lemoni Cafe next time I'm in Miami! The group that I was with dines there weekly and everything that they recommended on the menu was delish! If you are ever in Miami check in to Lemoni yelpers and you won't be disappointed!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/5/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Had lunch here and was pleased to see so many vegetarian and vegan options. The menu is huge - so many great items to choose from. I opted for the hummus appetizer and the veggie quesadilla as my entree, and was happy with both dishes. The hummus was flavorful, everyone loved it. The quesadilla portion was really big, enough for me to take some home. My one qualm is that it was a tad bit on the greasy side. Other than that, love everything about this place and will be coming back for more!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/5/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Delicious! I ordered via Uber Eats and everyone at the office was pleased with their meals. Fresh quality food prepared perfectly. It's hard finding restaurant options as a Vegan to eat alongside non-Vegans, but this menu is extensive and you're sure to find an option for everyone. My Vegan Meatball Sub on a whole wheat baguette came with a side salad and was superb, a bit skimpy on the marinara/tomato sauce, but fantastic flavors nonetheless. Everything was hot and fresh and the salad dressing was amazing. I also loved my avocado, date, spinach, mango, and almond milk smoothie. I can't wait to dine in Saturday or Sunday for Brunch, maybe then I'll give it the 5 stars it likely deserves."
"701 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",3/17/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,"Black bean hummus to DIE for!!! Other two: black bean bowls (kale, pumpkin seeds, carrots, onion, garbanzo and black beans in a lemon vinaigrette topped with guacamole).

"701 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/26/2017,$$,4,American Harvest Co,"On a vegan diet for a month. This place has a few vegetarian options. Has to substitute a few things. I ordered the hipster bowl and it was very flavorful imagine adding some protein to that!! And the curry bowl was very healthy and yummy. It was like a home cooked meal. Portions are very filling and prices are great. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu. ,Please get a baby changing table in your bathroom!"
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/7/2014,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"This place is perfect! Savory, sweet, light, filling... Whatever you want.

Plenty of vegetarian & vegan options. ,Everything tastes good, practically everything is healthy, I hope it stays for a long time."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/21/2016,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,Oh my sweet baby Jesus. As a vegan it's hard for me to find places to eat this location came up while I was near the area. First off they deliver and they are like a concierge service when you call in so helpful and patients from the call to the delivery the service was impeccable. Now about the food. The veggie burger touched my soul ( not sure if I'm just starving but this thing is beyond delicious) vegan friendly cream broccoli soup and carrot cake. To a vegan goody this is music to my taste buds. This place is a must try
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/4/2016,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,Found this spot on Yelp. My brother wanted lunch and he prefers clean eats and vegan meals at times. This was a perfect choice. The spot was clean. Service was friendly and quick food was fresh and delicious. I would recommend them to others who like more natural food options.
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/15/2018,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. Someone recommended the black bean cricket burger. It was amazing! Additionally, the ambiance is very relaxed. The garden is beautiful and helps create the cozy, relaxed ambiance. The food was also very reasonably priced. I look forward to coming back every time I visit Miami."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/9/2017,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"This place is an absolute gem.  Will has created an environmentally friendly urban paradise in the Health District.  The food is fantastic - it's fresh and accommodates every type of diet I can think of (vegan, gluten free, paleo, even keto).  ,I recommend the cowboy bowl, the veggie burger and the cookies.  ,The prices are totally reasonable and the staff is attentive and helpful."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/11/2017,$$,4,Smart Bites Cafe,Had a chocochya burger which was some sort of seaweed burger with seeds and it was so good with the Chipotle mayo! This was vegan and also they have a good selection of vegan foods off their menu. The entire restaurant is very quaint and cozy with lots of plants and water (you will hardly even realize you are next to a major road)
"701 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/14/2018,$$,4,American Harvest Co,"I went there specifically for the vegan options however, the quinoa patty was not available. Everything else was wonderful clean and great customer service."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/5/2018,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"My (vegan) sister is in town, so we decided to try this place after looking at the menu. Everything was delicious, affordable, and filling! We both had a beet burger that was on special (and recommended by the owner)- it was one of the most incredible vegan burgers I've ever had. I also tried some of my bf's Mediterranean bowl which was also really good and I will probably get for myself next visit. The owner gave us a complimentary cookie for being our first visit, and we will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/1/2017,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"Great food cool environment, of your in the area you should stop by. They offer many vegan and non vegan options. The bison burger is epic."

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/6/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Just stopped by Della's Test Kitchen.  I'm not a vegan but I was attracted by the healthy menu.  I couldn't believe how tasty everything was.  The banana split dessert was incredible.  I will be back whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/18/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"OH EM GEEEE!!! This place is what every city needs! Not only is the food completely amazing (I recommend the green bowl, add tempeh and make sure to try the hot sauce on the side) but the staff is so authentic and kind and attentive and just so incredibly friendly in the most down to earth kinda way.... oh!! and make sure to get an almond butter cup! amaaaaazing! my daughter (who is 5) and I frequent Dellas probably 3 times a week and she just loves the roasted sweet potatoes and a side of avocado... its such a chill environment where she can run around and i don't have to worry about her disrupting other guests. the staff has gone as far as to play with her and show her around the place... its so refreshing to feel so comfortable out at such  trendy place! I am extremely picky about what I eat, as a nutritionist and vegan chef, i completely endorse Dellas Test Kitchen and the people behind it. from what i can tell, this is the best quality food one can find in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Amazing. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan and I am addicted to the food here. Great atmosphere, music and food"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/22/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"I love Della Bowls and am happy to finally see a well executed Vegan fast casual concept come to Florida! I selected the Mediterranean Bowl, and it was absolutely amazing. I was scared that because it was Vegan it wouldn't be filling, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The shakes are absolutely to die for. If you are in the Wynwood area you absolutely need to try Della!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/27/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Great place, vegan bowls, just what you need when your overloaded with processed foods!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/5/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I don't consider myself a vegan-y person, but I tried the Curry Bowl the other day when I was at the Yard and it was AMAZINGGGGG. Wasn't even that familiar with tempeh but it was really hearty and I left full and satisfied. Definitely going back."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/11/2016,$$,5,della bowls,This place sets the bar for what a plant-based restaurant experience should be! The menu is incredible and they offer cocktails unlike many other vegan spots. They have amazing events and specials as well. I highly recommend everyone check it out!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2016,$$,5,della bowls,This place had amazing vegan bowls! They have some great combos to choose from or you could build your own! We went after yoga and the outdoor reggae band was playing creating a fun vibe. It was fun to be in a casual outdoor spot and enjoy a wit bite of amazing vegan food!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/26/2016,$$,5,della bowls,I went the other day with my family and was quite impressed. Although I do not eat lots of vegetarian/vegan foods I was surprised by how flavorful everything was. I got the Mediterranean bowl and LOVED IT! Everyone working was also very nice and helped navigate us through the menu. It is a bit pricy but definitely worth it!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"A friend did me right with his recommendation of Della Test Kitchen. Food was righteously fine, portions filling, price low, and service fast (It was a rainy Saturday night and not crowded, so I can't say how it is on a busy night.). After reading all the accolades for the Southwest Bowl, I knew my order before reading the menu. I loved it! My wife had the special bowl which she equally enjoyed and the smoothie we shared was tasty. We are not vegans, but enjoy good food and beverages and will return for sure. Some customers bought drinks at the outdoor bar in the open air Wynwood Yard, so if you want liquor with your dinner, it is available. On Saturday night there was a band playing on the stage across the plaza from Della inside the Yard which provided pleasant background music. Check it out."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Vegan, organic, healthy, build-your-own salad bowls. + desserts. laid-back environment. come, chill, and have some good food!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,By far one of my top favorite restaurants. If I didn't live 40 minutes away I would be here everyday. Their bowls are AMAZING and so filling. So full of flavor and deliciousness. Reasonable price considering the amount of food you get. Even if you aren't vegan you will fall in love. I usually stick with the green bowl and I crave it all the time!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/22/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"All vegan hub serving very tasty bowls, smoothies and desserts. I'm not a vegan and I still thought the food was delicious. It's quite on the pricier side: my meal was about $19 (I got an $11 bowl and an $8 smoothie). Not a bad meal at all, but I probably will avoid the eight dollar smoothie for it only being around 14oz."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/24/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Delicious and hearty vegan bowls. I love the red sauce! My only recommendation would be to offer a dessert with peanut butter :)
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/6/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my go to spot. The food is always fresh and the service is great. If you want fresh, raw, vegan food quickly this it the place to go."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The food is outstanding, best vegan place in the area. You can create your own bowl. I ordered the mediterranean and it was perfect, I loved it.  The only thing that I would say it wasn't good is that they allow dogs to be unleashed and pee where the tables are...I saw this big pup peeing twice right infront of me and the owner won't even say sorry...ew"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/3/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My vegan sister brought me here and as someone who LOVES meat, this was an insult at first but I do LOVE my sister so I didn't say anything and gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did!

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Della Bowls has amazingly fresh, vibrant, clean food that tastes as great as it makes you feel! They are conscious through and through, from ingredient selection to choice of disposable products used- and they even have a huge on site garden that they can pick from! Locally made iced tea, fresh teas, smoothies, and raw vegan desserts that taste as decedent as their guilt worthy counterparts. I will be back! Again, and again, and again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Filling food with tons of flavor and zero guilt! Della's customizable bowls are made with healthy ingredients that are irresistible to everyone, whether you are vegan or not.  I find the southwest & green bowls to be especially DELICIOUS and topped with mouth watering sauces that make me drool just thinking about them. The atmosphere at the wynwood yard is casual and inviting, so you can enjoy the outdoors while stuffing your face. This place is heaven! You won't be disappointed."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"The bowls are insanely good! Wow, I went there with my vegan friend and was at first intimidated but kinda just went for it and created my own bowl and it turned out so good and tasty. The staff is amazing and super helpful."

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Love the concept. The food is vegan and non-processed. The bowl I got was fresh and tasty. I would add more sauce to the bowls. Make sure you order the biggest bowl, or you will likely go hungry when you leave. Looks like you can bring your dogs if they behave well."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/7/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Best meal I had during my entire trip to Miami. The greens are grown in a garden behind the restaurant . Everything tastes so fresh and it was very reasonably priced considering the quality of the service and the ingredients. Not to mention the location is SPECTACULAR. I would eat here every day if I could. If you're a vegan , 100% come here for your next meal in wynwood !!!!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Hands down one of the best vegan spots in Miami. We had two customized bowl along a green lemonade and almond butter joy. Great food awesome staff and impeccable service.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Yummmmm! My friend recommended the Caribbean bowl and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not vegan but dishes like the Caribbean bowl and all of its flavor could help to sway me.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan food I've had in Miami. Most places offer very few vegetarian options. Della has many of healthy delicious options. Staff was friendly. Definitely going back.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I'm not vegan and this food is still amazing. I had the dalé bowl, which reminds me a lot of just a healthier, yummier version of a Mexican burrito bowl. The atmosphere of Wynwood yard is so quaint with lots of picnic tables and shade and there was constantly a line for this place over the others!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/16/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Very cool. The whole Wynwood yard concept is so much fun. It's a great spot to take your fur baby and chill on an open air cushiony bench in the garden, grab a drink at the stocked bar or grab a bite at Dellas. There are other rotating food trucks in the yard but Dellas is the anchor. The concept is healthy, vegan based on a build your own bowl kind of thing. Choose your base, your protein, your toppings and sauce. Not all that original here in Miami but the whole yard concept is just fun. Everything is outdoors. The bar and Dellas are,Covered but you're still outside so during the summer it's gonna be a bit hot and sticky. Downtown is always hotter than the beach. No wind, no air and it gets crowded there. The bowls are tasty, again not out of this world. The serving size if you get greens as your base, is a bit skimpy for the price. I got greens, chickpeas, lentils avocado and a walnut pesto. Good stuff but was hungry 15 minutes later and $15 lighter. ,It's fun to grab a healthy bite here, they have wifi, you can bring your laptop and your dog and chill. For me those are all big pluses nu today you're just going for a healthy bite, it's solid but not out of this world. ,You can make a whole afternoon of hanging in the yard though and that's fun. Plus you're in Wynwood and O cinema is right next,Door. And afternoon and stretch into the evening and the into the night."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,First time here. Best Vegan Food in Wynwood.. The food was amazing. I had the Southwest bowl with extra spice and a carrot ginger juice.. Will definitely be returning to della. Real soon..
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Let me start by saying this: I am not a vegan.,Della manages to take flavors, mash them together, and create some of the most tantalizing dishes I have ever had, all without an ounce of animal products. Her sauces are completely craveable, which, for vegan food, is a new sensation for me. But seriously, I will be sitting at work and my mouth will start watering just thinking about the Mediterranean bowl. ,I never feel dissatisfied eating Della bowls, which is a huge issue I have with vegan food, and one of the many reasons I am not a vegan. Her grains and artful preparation of vegetables leaves you feeling like you have all the energy you need to power your afternoon. ,Also if you actually can't convince your friends to eat vegan, there are 3 other food trucks right next to it on the Wynwood Yard that are all very good as well!,Get the Mediterranean bowl or the Southwest bowl. BOOM. Della bowls ROCK!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/14/2018,$$,4,della bowls,Creative and tasty vegan options.  I've been a vegetarian for decades and can't figure out why it often upsets my stomach a little bit... but I always go back after a few weeks.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I are not vegan but just fell in love with this place: delicious and healthy bowls, amazing location and super friendly service. We can't wait to come back!"

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan bowls in town for sure. The Caribbean bowl is amazing plus it has adashah which is delicious. The broccoli was sooooo good lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Just WOW. Vegan bowls that are soooo wholesome and filling and Delish!. Its a must for food lovers.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I am obsessed with this place. And I've only been here once. I'm actually still halfway through my Dalé  bowl. It doesn't matter if you're vegan or not, the food is incredible. The atmosphere in The Wynwood Yard is unmatched. Come check it out. You cannot be disappointed. If you don't want the bowls already listed, you can create your own! It's really all about you. ,Ah! Ok. I'm going to finish my amazing food."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/14/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Service doesn't exist until you find it. We were told to sit at a table until we were ready to order and waited for close to an hour. After an hour we found a staff member to tell them we were ready to order and they had no idea we were ready to order. They told us after an hour to wait for someone else to find us to order. Have never seen a place so poorly run. Completely unacceptable and people that ordered after us received their food. I've been to the food trucks around Wynwood yard and have been treated with respect but have never been as insulted as well have here. Prep is easy seeing how it is vegan. Bush league presentation. ,Edit: 2 hours after this review....Owner came over to apologize for the service which was incredibly thoughtful and kind. Food finally arrived and was very tasty. We had a variety of the bowls which were delicious just as reviews had promised. Sadly I still had a bad taste in my mouth from a server telling me that the service was delayed because it was raining while those in the kitchen were visually on their phone and not partaking in food prep. I think this is likely an anomaly and hope that others realize this is not a common occurrence."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I came here as a newbie to Vegan food brought by my uncle and his wife who are vegans. I had my doubts of the vegan genre, but was pleasantly delighted (and IMPRESSED) by the food. I ordered the Caribbean bowl which was black coconut rice, adashah, sweet plaintains, kale, avocado, toasted coconut and yellow sauce. Let me tell you, I was impressed from the first bite.  The flavors paired perfectly together and I savored every bite. I will definitely be back next time I am in Miami."

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is by far the best quick, casual, vegan restaurant in Miami. The dalé bowl is excellent and the almond butter cup is out of this world. Cannot wait for their new locations to open."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,They have a lot of interesting selections and the Dale bowl is my favorite.  The atmosphere is nice .  Everything is delicious.  This is one of my favorite vegan places.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,created my bowl and it was AWESOMMMMME! Can't wait to go back and try more! I went with two of my non vegan friends and they loved Della just as much as I did!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"So GOOD everytime i'm in wnywood its my go to place, its a vegeterian and vegans heavan and super filling"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/17/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"The recipes and food looks like it's straight out of Grattitude Cafe in LA.  The original menu looked a rip off also.  The food is really good though, best vegan bowls around anyways.  Doesn't compare to the real Grattitude Cafe, the gang does a great job though.  Really sweet servers and generally chill atmosphere."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/28/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Thank you Della for an affordable vegan option in the Wynwood area! Possibly the only one... It's so appreciated! More more more more places like this in Miami, universe, please!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,What a great place to eat if you want a little bit of everything. My wife wanted vegan so we went. Those things you do for Love.  Ordered a vegan bowl with her I have to say it was very good. It was a little pricey two bowls (which were pretty big) with a coconut water was about $40.00. Don't get me wrong it is really good food and the location is awesome. It Is an open air seating so you feel the air and where the veggies came from. It is good to eat something really healthy
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I recently went Vegan.  So as part of the new eating culture, a place like Della Test Kitchen is a must-try for anyone in Miami.  Located in the Wynwood Yard, Della serves up very high quality offerings.  The selection is impressive - most of the creations are plug-and-play with the ingredients.  You choose items from different categories and they make your creation.  For someone like me, I choose to go along with their pre-selected options, lest I take up too much time in line with indecision, annoying the rest of the people in line behind me.  The Dale Bowl is my favorite so far.  The food is fresh, delicious and filling.  You definitely don't leave hungry.  Even if you aren't vegan, the food is great!  Try it, you'll like it."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Stunning... I love food. And those vegan bowls are amazing ... is clean and tasty. We love the wynwood yard atmosphere also
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Legitimately some of the best food I've ever had. I went there twice during a 3-day vacation in Miami. As a vegan, It was amazing to find a spot where everything on the menu was not only vegan, but also healthy and delicious.,Definitely recommend creating your own half-and-half bowl with black coconut rice as a base. Also try the adashah!,They were out of a few things when I went, so just be mindful of that."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Very cool place. It's located the an area dedicated to food truck but they are stay in food trucks with tables and fans. The food was original and tasty as a vegetarian option. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I enjoyed it. I made my own bowl which was made up of black coconut rice, temps, avocado and plantains!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/16/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"This is a small, casual, unpretentious food truck/outdoor spot in wynwood that serves veggie bowls and smoothies. Everything is vegan. This is a great place to take your food purist friends ;) and anyone on a gluten free diet or lactose intolerant. You can design your own bowl which means you get to pick all the ingredients. ,I had the southwest bowl and the red corvette smoothie (see photos). Very tasty and fresh. I felt satisfied but not overly full.,I would give the food a 5, but the service and prices a 3 ($20 for my two items). So overall a 4. I would come here again, as overall I had a good experience and there are not a lot of places like this in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2017,$$,5,della bowls,If I could give more stars I would!!!! Yummy! I love everything on the menu how easy is it to be vegan and eat so deliciously:-) the Caribbean bowl is my fav but they're all my favorite lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my food hero! Not only has she created a delicious menu of vegan options that are appealing even to a non-vegetarian like myself, but she's also the brainchild behind Wynwood Yard, the space that the truck is situated on, and many of the ingredients in the bowls come from the garden in the back. ,We went during the lunch hour, so it took a little while for the food to come out. I had the Southwest bowl - I liked that  some of the ingredients (sweet potatoes and tempeh) were served warm, and I was pleasantly surprised by how filling and satisfying the bowl was as a meal. It's definitely a great lunch option for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/17/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First time I have a bowl of 100% Vegan fare. I have to admit I was bummed they didn't have salmon or chicken and when I got my bowl I was like meh... until I started eating it! ,No need for animal protein in here. The Caribbean bowl has all I needed. Yes I'll take plantains over chicken :),Great spot and free wifi"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Vegan bowls out of a food truck? My first thought when I heard of Delia's but I'm glad I pushed aside from that. My first time trying them was as delivery. Yummy put a bit more than I like to pay to eat at my desk. ,The Caribbean bowl was memorable enough for me to decide to go check them out in person. Well worth it. ,Inside the Wynwood Yard, this truck has a great location with proper seating and coverage from the sun. Complimentary spa water and quick service and I was sold. The location is fun and there is lots to see/observe. ,Even if you aren't vegan, or vegetarian even, I recommend coming here to carb load on yumminess."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/1/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Excellent vegan food in a super fun atmosphere.  Outside seating, walk-up ordering, and beautifully presented Buddha-bowl-style meals."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,I'm not vegan and the adashah in the Caribbean bowl is amazing. I wish I knew its nutritional value. Will return !
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I was in the area and needed to eat something quick. Thanks god for Yelp and this place did not disappoint. The menu is vegan based, and they do such an excellent job that it's bursting with flavors - for any hesitant people and the ones who love their meat ( I do! ). ,It's worth the visit if you want to try something new. The ambiance is quiet, granted I came during the day which is not when this area is usually very busy. ,So I was going to order the curry bowl, but they had a new one called Dalé (haha!). It was amazing. Anything with avocado has my name on it. They also have the ability to create your own bowl, and they also offer breakfast options, smoothies and desserts. ,Great job and if I find myself in the area again, I'll be back!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Awesome place. The food was really good, and it's a great place to sit if it's not too hot. We got the Caribbean bowl and Dale bowl. Both were good, but I liked the flavors in the latter best. Fresh, healthy, and vegan."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/30/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Few people could be more carnivorous than me. I love meat and I rarely have a meal without an animal in it. I'm also a foodie so just because I enjoy meat does not mean I don't enjoy plants too. I love fruits, veggies, and other non-animal organics. I ate here because my daughter's on a health kick and I figured why not. I can say that if I HAD to be a vegetarian, Della's would be my number one choice!! I had the brown rice, chick peas w sea salt, crispy broccoli w olive oil & garlic, yellow cashew curry, and avocado and loved everything about it. Totally vegan and very filling (took a good portion home). Would definitely eat there again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,One of my favorite vegan restaurants. Best vegan bowls in the city. The cauliflower & mushroom additions made to the menu are . Definitely must check this place out if you want to try vegan food in Miami.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is the i-can't-believe-it's-vegan staple. The bowls here are beyond delicious (I actually crave them daily) and the ambiance is absolutely amazing! It's chill and earthy and organic. Plus everyone that works here is amazing! ,Recommendation: Definitely try their Caribbean Bowl! It's impossible not to love it. If you want a smoothie, they have an almond butter banana one that hits the spot multiple times. ,This is a must try spot in Miami. A place I'd call home. If you haven't been yet... are you really even living?!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Wow! That's the best way to describe this delicious vegan food! So tasty and healthy! I regret not ordering the larger bowl but was just enough to fulfill me. I had the Dale Bowl, so yummy!  I definitely recommend this to all my vegan friends  They also have UBEREATS to deliver! Will order again! Thanks guys!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/24/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Oh, it's all vegan? Yes it is, folks, and let me tell you: I didn't miss meat at all while eating from Della Test Kitchen. ,Their menu consists of bowls that already have the ingredients chosen for you. A friend of mine told me she usually opts for the green bowl that has avocado, broccoli and other types of green veg. I decided to make my own custom bowl with a base of black coconut rice, tempeh protein, sweet potato, yellow curry cashew sauce and toasted almonds. WOW! It was so delicious. I don't think I've ever felt so GOOD and FULL after eating a vegan dish. The portion size was fantastic; I could have saved some for later, but I had a friend help me eat it. Every component of the dish was cooked and spiced to perfection. ,Next time I'm in the Wynwood Yard, I will glady become vegan for a meal without any regrets."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"When I'm in Wynwood this is where I go for my vegan lunch. Really good, fairly fast service and a fun environment. It's outdoors so you can bring your fur kids :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/11/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Yes yes yes! I was having lunch with a dairy-free friend and knew that Della Test Kitchen would be a good place for us to hit up since it's vegan. ,You can create your own bowl or opt for one of the existing combinations. Since I was a first timer, I decided to go with the Southwest bowl of greens, quinoa, tofu, sweet potatoes, tomato, sunflower seeds, avocado and red sauce. I also grabbed some of the hot pepper sauce on the counter to douse on top. It was spicy but went perfectly with this dish. Overall, my bowl was fresh, filling and flavorful. It was hard to finish it all but I couldn't leave one bite because it was that good! I also stole a bite of my friend's Curry bowl. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can find or make a bowl to suit you.,I can't wait to try more combos and would definitely have lunch here weekly if I could! Bowls are $9.50 with smoothies and other drinks costing between $7-$8. You order at the truck and then sit under the tent to wait for your food. It's an overall chill atmosphere and perfect for when it's nice outside.,There seemed to be some confusion among the staff when it came to food getting delivered, so I'd maybe suggest using a number system instead of the name calling. The girl taking our order also had to answer the phone a few times to worry about deliveries, which held the long line up a bit. The food gets to ya eventually and is worth the wait!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This place serves amazing plant based bowls. The Mediterranean bowl is a party in your mouth. Everything fresh and so tasty and very decent prices. I hope this place stays up permanently. The area is so cool and cute, which makes it perfect for a nice late lunch dinner with friends. Wynwood yard yes for vegan options in Miami!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/15/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"""Want to try this place? It's vegan"" my friend asked me, knowing full well that I love meat. However, it being a gorgeous night in Wynwood, live music playing in the background, and pretty stringed lights hung about,  I decided ""why not?"" and tried Della's kitchen and what can I say? Vegan tasted really good. It was filling and satisfying. ,Dellas is a create your own bowl place with options of base, vegetables, faux meats, and sauce. There are also options for bowls per Della's creation. I decided to go with the Caribbean bowl. It was a delicious generously portioned bowl of black coconut rice(so good), plantain, kale, avocado, curry sauce, and a faux meat (I can't recall the name of it). It was very filling and flavorful! There is bench seating right in front of the truck as well as a water station. I  thoroughly enjoyed my late night dinner at Dellas in Wynwood yard and I am looking forward to my next vegan meal there. :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/20/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"In my dream life Della would be my personal chef.  Every Monday I wake up and swear that I will only eat healthy foods ever again. But by Tuesday I am usually craving only the delicious.  Della Bowls nails the healthy and the delicious.  I consider myself a pretty sophisticated cook, but I wasn't able to decipher what was in my bowl.  It was the most incredible mix of flavors and textures. This food is NOT only for the vegans of the world.  It is different and interesting.  I wish I could remember the name of what I had eaten, but based on what I could see on the menu, you can't go wrong.  All of the bowls are winners.  AND if you haven't been to the Wynwood Yard, run!  It's a great mix of food, drink, Music and coolness.  It's perfectly blended to create the setting for a fantastic Della Bowl."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I am absolutely IN LOVE! Have been wanting to try this forever and I'm so embarrassed that I didn't before because it's SO good! Think of a healthy vegan chipotle, the possibilities are endless when it comes to creating your perfect bowl. They even offer black coconut rice, which I have never seen before. And to super size your bowl for just a few extra bucks, you get to choose two of each category and basically have two meals! ,Of course once my friend, Danny, told me about this option, I had to super size it. Best decision ever cause my leftovers were like a golden midnight snack. So light and filling! The sauces are amazing, they drizzle plenty over your creation. I had the tempeh, and at first bite, you get this instant teriyaki type tofu taste. So delicious. And you MUST try their plaintains because they are the best ever! Usually plaintains are super oily from your typical Latin restaurants but not Della's! They're baked into ooey gooey sweetness pieces of perfection. ,This food truck is poppin inside a little area called Wynwood Yard. They're closed on mondays so be sure to come every other day as it's worth it! I was so pleased with every little thing in my bowl, I will come back over and over to try the entire menu! By the way, they only give you one slice of avocado so think about that before you ask for it lol"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/7/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I happened upon della bowls at Wynwood Yard on our first night in Miami. It was recommended to us by the woman from the store right next to it and she did not steer us wrong. Absolutely the best vegan food we had on our trip! We had the dalé bowl (at the cashiers recommendation) and BYO with black coconut rice, adashah, kale, sweet potatoes, avocado and gold sauce. They were both insanely delicious! Both sauces were incredible and the adashah is so creative and versatile! Della makes food the way I cook at home, only better. My wife and I loved it...so so great!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The idea behind most of Della Test Kitchen's offerings is simple: vegan proteins, veggies, and a sauce on a base of rice, quinoa, or greens in a bowl. The execution, however, is delicious. I've recommended it to people visiting Wynwood and have taken people there when I am in the area. The food is consistent and never disappoints. ,You can create your own bowl or select one of their recommended combinations. I've tried about 4 at this point, and they've all been good. There are multiple flavor profiles available, so there is bound to be something to suit your tastes. ,They also have some other things on the menu, like juices. I have had one of the juices and it was tasty.,The actual kitchen is a trailer in Wynwood yard. There is metered street parking right out front. The setting is quiet, and there are several picnic tables under a covered area. Because it is outside, it is pet friendly. The tables are decorated with succulents and the surrounding landscaping is lush enough that it feels a lot greener than most parts of typically industrial Wynwood.,Water pitchers and disposable cups are available, but because they use a refillable glass pitcher, you can also bring your own water bottle and fill it on your own if you're trying to minimize your waste."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Favorite vegan place in Miami!! I come all the way from Aventura just to get a bowl , hope to see it soon near Aventura"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First off, I am not a vegan but I loved this place!! I was introduced to Della by a friend who has been a vegetarian for a while now and she recommended this while we were at Wynwood Yard. I'm so glad she did!! Whenever I think vegan, I've always thought of super healthy, dry, not very pleasant vegetables. This was the total opposite. Della has their signature mixed bowls or you can build your own. There are smoothies and desserts. They also have salads. The staff was very nice and was able to answer all our questions. ,I built my own half and half bowl, which is two of every category. I got quinoa and black coconut rice(forbidden rice) with tempeh, chickpeas, crispy broccoli, sweet potato, toasted almonds, pico de gallo on the side, and the yellow curry cashew sauce along with the green garlic here pesto sauce. This was packed with nutrition and full of flavor. Blew my mind. The chickpeas were soft, tempeh was tangy ginger tasting, the broccoli was perfect, the pico was refreshing. I loved the black rice. It's so fragrant and absorbs the sauces very well. Never knew I would crave a vegan rice and veggie bowl but if all vegan food tasted this good, I'd consider dropping meat!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/9/2018,$$,3,della bowls,"I'm gonna be honest - I'm vegan and I make nutri bowl/Buddha bowl often. I'm used to eating and working with the same ingredients as Della Test Kitchen serves. I had the make-your-own bowl and I was disappointed. For almost 12$ I got a bowl of rice, with sweet potato, tempeh and pico de Gallo (which tbh must have been dirt cheap to make). I just feel like it's overpriced for a vegan dish that doesn't require that much effort and when it's from a FOOD truck. Food truck food shouldn't be expensive lol! Anyways, the bowl made to order wasn't impressive and I won't be going back when I can go down the street to a REAL restaurant to get a fresh wrap or bowl for cheaper!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Miami needs more places like Dellas. Absolutely love their bowls. I typically build my own and mix and match ingredients. My best bowl combo: black coconut rice, tempeh, broccoli, avocado, and yellow sauce. The yellow sauce is a coconut curry cashew base; it's so good you'll want extra (only $1 - get the extra sauce, trust me). The bowl is the perfect size to fill you up, but you can always get a super-sized bowl when you're feeling extra hungry. Love the set up of the place in Wynwood Yard - great for a casual al fresco lunch. My one suggestion is for Dellas to get some stronger fans around the seating area; it gets super hot there in the summer. Besides that, keep it up Dellas. Love what you're bringing to the Miami vegan scene."

Amazing service and awesome food! :)"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",3/16/2017,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Place is a little expensive but worth it on a treat yourself kind of day, I love the vegan gyoza and the taro bubble tea, the bubble tea was especially sweet and so good! I've been there 3 times and the only thing I didn't like was their vegan sandwhich, the bread was stale and the sauce didn't really taste that good, but other than that, I fully recommend their desserts, their tea, gyoza, soup etc etc"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/10/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Was bored of the usual coffee places nearby when I found this little cafe. Had their spicy Raman and vegan gyoza. The spicy Raman was really good and the gyoza was ok.. I wish they introduce chicken gyoza also. I had their coffee frappe and my friend had the green tea frappe. ,Too full to try the raindrop cake but I m coming back soon to have it. ,Yes! They have the raindrop cake!!"

I love tofu, and that dish wasn't huge but it was so yummy and it filled me up, especially with the large tea I ordered. I can't wait to go back and try more of their vegan options!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/18/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I absolutely love this spot! The food is so yummy and delicious. I enjoy coming here because it has a great ambiance! I also enjoy the vegan options! This place is definitely a favorite of mine ! I love bringing my friends here. The employees are also very attentive and endearing!
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",9/29/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I go to this place all the time because of its location. Love their vegan spicy ramen and their Yaki Udon. Definitely a vegetarian friendly place with options for everyone. You can't leave here without having their Zombie Plant dessert. It's sooooo good. I love watching it transform and then devouring it moments later. Can't wait to try their other desserts. Would love to see some new vegan/vegetarian options on the menu in terms of entrees but I love what they have right now so no complaints.
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/1/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"On my top 5 of best hole in the wall Asian restaurants in Miami. Delicious options for everyone including vegan or vegetarian. Tastes very authentic and leans towards Korean flavors and inspirations. Dessert, dinner, or just coffee are all wonderful choices. I've been numerous times but my favorite dish is the Spicy Ramen."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",11/25/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"If you're vegan and love Thai food, this is your place. The menu is plentiful and the food is delicious.

The environment is very enjoyable, staff is nice and friendly, and food is amazing . I come here at least twice a week. Vegans and Vegetarians, I highly recommend this place. It's always a struggle to us finding places to eat, but you will feel appreciated here."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",12/18/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"I'd never expect to find this place in the shopping center where it is. The staff is so friendly (Asian) that they gladly made Cuban coffee for a local woman who came in yelling asking if they had any. I've had the tofu pad Thai, spicy ramen and veggie gyozas and all are pretty great. Not the best pad Thai I've had but definitely the best tofu I've ever had. Most of the menu options can be prepared vegan or vegetarian. They'll assume you'll want a fork, so extra points if you ask for chopsticks instead."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/15/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is one of my faves! It's quaint with modern yet rustic decor. The menu is written on a huge chalkboard and ordering is done at the counter. The food is delicious, I've been there a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Korean rice bowl, the portion is large and the flavors are on point. Surprisingly the desserts are also good. The strawberry crepe is amazing! Light & fluffy and not too sweet. They also have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus. Service is friendly and there is plenty of free parking available."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/27/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Absolutely my favorite place ever. The staff is beyond amazing. I always get taro or coffee Boba here, and the vegan gyoza. The only thing is that I wish they had LOWER PRICES. this is next to fiu and a lot of my friends don't like to go since a bowl of noodles is $13. It is a bit over priced. But nonetheless AMAZING food. Amazing staff. Amazing decoration"

Vegan options are also available. I had the Pad See Ew with tofu and no eggs and it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",2/12/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I lost track of how many times I've been to this gem. After a long day of studying, it's so comforting to indulge myself in a hot bowl of ramen. Flavorful food and divine desserts. The Spicy Ramen is amazingggg. It doesn't matter if it's chicken, shrimp, pork, or tofu; they're all lovely. They also have a ton of vegan options which is a huge plus. Make sure to leave room for dessert! My favorite dish here is the Zombie Plant! Only order it if you have enough time to wait for it to be prepared because it does take a long time (~25 minutes). I promise you it is worth every second. It has layer over layer of ice cream, fruit and pound cake all topped with ""dirt"" and served with milk on the side to pour over. It is to die for!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2018,$$,3,107 Taste 味,"I found this place while looking for vegan/vegetarian friendly places. Loved the spicy ramen. All tough the menu says to advise them if you are VEGAN, DO NOT, been here three and times they have practically laughed in my face all of them. Matcha latte, recommended as well as the vegetable steamed dumplings. Downside, the plastic utensils. Love the menu options and ambience, only wish they were more mind-full of peoples dietary choices."

Food is delicious, one of my favorite bowls is the Caribbean. You may choose from a variety of options from beans, green veggies to quinoa and brown rice. ,I find the price inexpensive compared to other places I've been to within the area of Wynwood. It is worth trying at least once! ,Service wise, I cannot say a lot because it kinda of work like a fast food truck with the difference that this is healthy food. ,A great plus is that you can seat there and relax listening to live music from the Wynwood Yard! I love it!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/9/2018,$$,3,della bowls,"Well I am usually a fan of anything vegan even though I am not a vegan myself. I was very excited to try the Caribbean bowl. Got it delivered very quickly with Uber eats and I also ordered the Cocoa Berry Bliss smoothie. ,The bowl had a nice presentation.  The kale greens were very bright and beautiful.  The avocado was also very black inside and had a very bitter taste. I would have preferred if the avocado was maybe sliced instead of a half just placed in the center.I usually love plantains in vegan bowls but some plantains were rock hard and others were ok. There was nothing very special about the bowl and I did not finish it because of the sour taste from the avocado and the hardness of the plantain. The Yellow Sauce had a nice flavor but also nothing special. ,The smoothie was not a smoothie at all. I could barely drink it. It was so chunky and I was not able to drink it. ,The best thing honestly was the pico de gallo which is usually not hard to mess up.,I really wanted to enjoy my meal and I really hate spending money on horrible food but this just wasn't for me. I would try again in the future but not anytime soon."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/6/2018,$$,4,della bowls,"we were on vacation with the family in Miami and decided to have a vegan meal. Seeing prior reviews, we decided to go down to Wynwood and give Della Bowls a try.,The food was made to order and the bowls were tasty. My wife decided to create her own bowl while I went with the Southwest bowl. We both enjoyed our meals and the servings were plentiful. ,The dessert options were very nice and the brownie sundae was awesome. ,The venue was very fun and the live music was great. ,We would definitely recommend this spot for a casual vegan meal with friends."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/11/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"The perfect place for anyone who's looking for delicious vegan options. They're located inside the wynwood yard and best of all, they're also available via Uber eats! I had the southwest bowl- very spicy, but very tasty if you can handle it. i also had the cocoa berry bliss smoothie. Definitely planning on trying some of their other bowls soon :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"i'm obsessed w della!! idk how i haven't given this 5 stars yet, i should have reviewed this place years ago! ok so-- i like the option of building your own bowl (i get the half and half form more options) or the premade bowls. everything is vegan and wholesome and you don't feel like crap after you eat it. i could drown everything in the green sauce. the food is always fresh and worth it's,value. the service is always good. one of my fav restaurant atmospheres--you never know who might be playing on the stage a few feet away ;) outdoor, care free, cozy vibe. great either during the day or at night. you can tell there was a lot of soul put into this."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Love this place!!! Delicious and healthy. If you are in the area and looking for a filling vegan option, this is the best place to go! The atmosphere  is fun, the food is fresh, the sauces rock! I can get enough of Dellas!!!!! ,The Wynwood Yard has tons of fun events, totally worth checking it out, there are several food options but I always find myself grabbing a meal at Dellas!"

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/1/2018,$$,3,della bowls,I am not sure if I really like this place yet or not. I ordered the Caribbean bowl on my the first time there.  The black coconut rice was way too hard. I devoured ot though because that's what a hangry person does.  I do have to admit and say the curry sauce was great! The bowls come in a large bowl... extraaaa large that is! There is ample space st the tables to sit amd enjoy your meal.  On my second time there.... I ordered the Dalé bowl. Meh.  It was alright.  Not the best. I think the flavor pairings for that bowl should be reviewed. It is a test kitchen. I came back again for a third time but did not order.  I sampled the tempeh. It was cold and dry. I wasn't really impressed. It is definitely not a bad option for a vegan meal considering the other options offered at Wynwood Yard.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,della bowls,This place is delicious. There aren't many vegan options in Miami the land of pig lard in pretty much everything. To find a vegan place is always an exciting thing especially one with food as delicious as Della bowls. My only complaint is that they are in wynwood yard which is far and annoying to park. I wish they were more centric so I can go all the time :3! The bowls are top notch and filling! You can tell all the ingredients are top notch! I love their sauces and love that you can buy them no
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/21/2018,$$,4,della bowls,"ITS NOT JUST FOR VEGANS!,Della bowls - need I say more?  4 stars. You can't go wrong here.  This place finds a way to make vegan fill your belly - and at a good price.  I regularly snag pickup for lunch, and I'm always feeling refreshed and recharged for the rest of the day. ,Parking = easy, lots of it on the street and side streets,Ambiance = outdoor seating, live music often, bar nearby ,I would definitely recommend Della's to anyone trying to get into vegan food, or anyone who's hungry!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/5/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Found a delish #vegan spot in Miami in the wynwood area.  Delish plant based bowls.  I got the dale bowl and my husband the Caribbean bowl. You choose your base, veggies who h were all good make or sweet potatoes and my favorite ripe plantains, sauce and extra topping like avocado or pico de gallo pepitas or toasted coconut or almonds.,Almond butter joy smoothie was good too.   Healthy and delish is the best combo.  Out door seating on this beautiful day was a plus."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/9/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Abe and Fernando helped us out a lot. It was me and my friends first time here and we changed our orders countless times lol ( Girl problems ) the food was refreshing and a good size portion, I'm not much of a vegan but the way they season and prepare the food makes me want to consider. I would highly recommend coming here!!"

"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",4/10/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"After finding this place on yelp about two months ago it has become our favorite spot! We've gone maybe 12 times since. The food is absolutely delicious. There's nothing that I've tried from here that isn't amazing. My top favorites are Spicy Ramen, Yaki Udon and Pad Thai! Best part is that they have vegan friendly versions. The staff is extremely kind and it feels like you're eating at a friends house because of how comfortable this spot is. Check it out, you won't regret it."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/6/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is incredible! They have delicious food and excellent service. Halley really elevated the experience, she has exceptional customer service skills, she is friendly and professional. Halley recommended the spicy ramen as well as the nutella crepe cake and I'm so happy I ordered both because they were amazing. I love that this cafe offers vegan/vegetarian options so regardless of your dietary choices, you will find something and it will be great."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",7/8/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Accidentally found this little cafe and I was pleasantly surprised to find clearly labeled vegan options!,The staff is always so nice, welcoming, and knowledgeable about the ingredients used in food. They will happily accommodate most dishes! ,My favorite is the sweet and sour tofu. I also love the strawberry milk tea and matcha latte that they can make with soymilk! They also have coffee and other teas available. I will definitely keep coming to this place all the time! The food is delicious and the service is great!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I've tried many spots for Ramen and this place is by far the best in Miami. I always order a Vegan Shio Ramen along with the Vegan Gyoza's and/or the Vegan Pad Thai. All the food is always made to order so it comes out warm and fresh. The taste of the broth in the ramen is delicious (add a little sirracha if you want a spicy kick), the pad thai noodles are always cooked very well (add cabbage!). For dessert I always get the Nutella Crepe Cake which is probably what the restaurant is known most for.,This is a order over the counter restaurant but the lovely staff brings you your food to the table once its ready. The restaurant is usually busy but they always manage to bring out the food in a timely manner. I am excited to continue to come to this establishment and try some of their other items as they all look so great! I come here almost every week and would recommend any Yelper's out there to do so as well."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Love this place! Great bubble tea, easy to make something vegan or shellfish free if needed. Lots of tasty options. My only complaint is that I wish they had lunch specials and I way to combine small plates. They should really think about having a menu like that especially for the students and university lunch community."
"3067 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/26/2012,$$,3,Jaguar Latin-American Kitchen,"This food would get another star if I weren't vegan and gluten-free. The ceviche is amazing but vegans and vegetarians will feel left out from this course of the meal. There are several delicious salads that are safe for vegans or people with Celiac's disease. There's one entree suitable for people with those requirements and another that's probably easily convertible. The service is average. The staff are polite enough and the owner recognizes and greets regulars. The price is reasonable for the area. It's a little loud and crowded, anticipate a wait during peak hours. This is a great place for people with food allergies to get a tasty light lunch and suitable for large groups with members with sensitive tummies."
"3067 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/1/2015,$$,5,Jaguar Latin-American Kitchen,"As s vegan, still my favorite restaurant. I try to go once a week, it's an obsession.. I always get something new. Now that I'm eating poultry and such again, I'm just in heaven.  Everything is amazing!!!!"
"3067 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/29/2014,$$,5,Jaguar Latin-American Kitchen,"Loved this place. Decor is nice, food is delicious and the service was good. Ordered the veggie sandwich with no cheese. Came with cheese which was disappointing but brought me a new one instantly.  The sandwich was wonderful and vegan!"
"541 SW 12th Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/27/2016,$$,5,Doce Provisions,Chef Justin delivers again with a smashing menu designed to delight your palate in unexpected ways.

There are vegan and vegetarian options, which is always a plus. ,The food had so much flavor. I don't think you could go wrong with whatever you end up choosing to eat here. ,The server recommended wonderful wines to go along with the meal and dessert. ,I tried the beet salad, cauliflower, vegan Black tagliatelle, and had to go big for both the chocolate and cappuccino desserts.,The atmosphere was very relaxed and quiet, perfect for a date or to work remotely from. Very much will recommend this place to anyone who comes to Miami!"

"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",9/14/2016,$$,5,Glass & Vine,"I absolutely loved this place ! Great for sharing, it's tapas style.  Really great selection for everyone, vegetarians, vegans and carnivores alike ! The cauliflower was to die for, as well as the scallops ! They also had an excellent cheese bread (forgot the name) perfect for a date night of ladies nights it's all good ! Give this place a try, it was close to perfect!"
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/20/2017,$$,5,Glass & Vine,"What a wonderful place. This restaurant is located in the heart of coconut grove in peacock garden. It has outdoor seating and indoor seating serving a gourmet menu that has plenty of options including a great surprise a god menu!! So it's outdoors with a family friendly environment  with slides and activities for the children, animal friendly with a puppy menu and amazing service and friendly professional staff. The manager Francesco was wonderful in his menu suggestions and accommodated all of our requirements as we were a vegan and vegetarian table. My puppy was over the moon in a place where he can eat at the same time as us and then play freely in the park. ,Simple outstanding a must visit!!"
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"Glass & Vine is a great date spot. The outdoor seating at night presents a romantic ambience. There's lots of trees with twinkling lights and nice background music. As a vegetarian, the menu wasn't as impressive as the setting. Wish we had more options. I ordered the semolina pasta, which is the only main dish option that I had to choose from. I recommend adding a couple more vegetarian + vegan options to the menu to accommodate to all types of guests, because this place does have an amazing ambience."
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/24/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"2 la mulas and 1 gin blossom! De-lish- us!!! I came here on a Wednesday night for happy hour which is from 5-7p. Great vibe. It's an outdoor bar/ restaurant but they have ""indoor"" seating, but the entire restaurant is still an  open concept. They had a DJ playing tropical chill kind of music. Great to catch up with friends or a first day date (in my opinion at least)- not an intimate vibe but comfortable. The bartender was so sweet, unfortunately I didn't get her name- but everyone there is just so friendly. The chef even came to greet us and ask if we had any questions about the menu. A must try is the 'charred cauliflower' and the 'fried yuca'- it was so yummy I couldn't even take a picture of it! Sorry!! Very stand up place for the summer- it'd confidently give it a 5/5. Definitely would go back. Vegetarian friendly (vegan if you ask for no cheese)"
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/14/2015,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! So you want to arrange a casual night out for the group. Should be simple, but it's not. You'll be six, or maybe nine. Four will be on time, one a little late, someone else very late, and oops! The babysitter flaked out, so now there's a last minute +1 or 2 little ones. And your best friend is vegan, and you don't like seafood. Four of 6 people are gluten-free, 1 doesn't drink alcohol, 3 of you can't tolerate spice, and somebody's an ovo/lacto vegetarian. To put it bluntly, your group is an absolute hot-mess, server's NIGHTMARE! Fear not. Mina's can handle it.,Step 1: Refer to the box on the top left of the menu and order the ""dips"" as a shared appetizer. You can get a variety of yummy, healthy snacks like hummus and tzatziki. They come with homemade pita bread, but you can ask for a couple of orders of Crudités for the gluten-frees. And the menu includes a couple of really tasty vegetarian entrées, there's a delicious homemade lemonade for tea-totalers, there's an amazing dish of mussels to share, and the wines are priced right by the glass or the bottle. NO NEED TO GET YOUR PRIVILEGE IN A BUNCH! The server has seemingly unlimited patience and professionalism. He will listen to your long list of special needs and make helpful suggestions without batting an eye. He almost seems to care that oregano gives Tiffany hives and wheat makes Brandi's belly bloat. Not only that, but he's happy to stand up on a chair to take the perfect group photo for the obligatory FaceBook post.,Step 2: Sit back and enjoy your special evening. The food is great, the service even better, and the space is beautiful. High ceilings and comfy seats. There's enough space between the tables to chat and toast and laugh without disturbing anyone. You'll actually relax and have a great time!,One last note: Mina's has ample free parking in a private lot behind the restaurant. No drama, even on a Saturday night."
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/23/2015,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"Visited Minas for Father's Day and had the Egyptian Brunch which was amazing. My BF who is Vegan had an Eggplant dish that was also great. I would had given it a 5 except that I was looking for more info on the food I was eating,  an explanation on what the food was and how to eat it. It was my first time eating Egyptian food and didn't know how to put it all together. I will Def go again."
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/9/2018,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"Went here on a Saturday evening with friends. Jonathan was very professional, honest and knowledgeable about their menu. Some of our favorites were the vegan moussaka, calamari, stuffed grape leaves, and the Besara dip. Quality ingredients & great service. Easy parking, too."
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/13/2017,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"Went here for dinner with my wonderfully picky partner. I loved the ambience of the place. And while the service was slow and the server not too knowledgeable about vegan choices the meal (Vegan Moussaka) was very good...better than my partners vegetarian meal. Using Yelp also allowed me a free dish of hummus, which was hummuslicious."
"646 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/5/2018,$$,3,109 Burger Joint,"This place is okay. The veggie black bean burger was yummy, and so were the fries. Not the best, not the worst. Apart from that, they didn't really have many vegan or vegetarian options. I don't even think they had many healthy options at all, from what I recall (I don't remember there being a salad option, but I could be wrong. If there was a salad option, it was probably sub par or I would remember ordering it).,The servers were friendly, but severely understaffed. The wait time is FOOORRREEVVVVEERR (*insert Sandlot gif here*). I'm not exaggerating. I have visited here twice; once with family and another time with friends, and we had to wait about 1-2 hours maybe? Quite a while, especially since neither of those times were especially busy. Well, maybe the second time but not nearly enough for the wait time to be that long. Maybe they've cracked down on the promptness, though, as this was awhile back. ,The parking is pretty bad. It's free, but the spaces are limited. This place is practically designed for students who park across the street or in 109 towers or 4th street commons. ,They do have trivia night, though! I believe they host them on Tuesdays. I've never been, but my brother goes sometimes and he always has fun. ,If you're not a picky eater and don't have a car, then this place is probably great. If you're a health conscious vegetarian or on a diet that isn't Atkin's or have a gas guzzling, carbon Big Foot printing hummer, go elsewhere."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2017,$$,4,Café Roval,"Mmmm! We had been here several weeks ago for dinner and decided to come back for brunch. We were not disappointed. The ambiance is fabulous. We sat inside for dinner, outside for brunch; a total European vibe. We would have liked to have seen Kois in the pond in the outside garden. The salmon board and vegan board were both delicious. Lobster Benedict was sprinkled with chunks of main lobster, but was missing some kick. Tres leches pancakes were a bit too cakey, but the flavor was on point. American platter was nice, pretty hard to get wrong. Mimosas were yummy...fresh squeezed oj. Latte, Americano and macchiato were good. ,Café Roval is super chill. Service was what we expected, think European style. The staff aims to please. I wouldn't come here if I was in a rush. The value was a bit pricey for what we had, but weighing it out, we'd still come back. The crowd was what I call, ""The Miami Mix""; Gays, Jews, Luncheon Ladies, Couples and Young Families...perfect! Next trip we'll try other items on the menu. Remember, this is Soyka's sister restaurant. It took a few months in the beginning for Soyka to get it right, my educated guess tells me that Café Roval will completely deliver soon enough and get their five *****'s."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",1/12/2017,$$,5,Café Roval,"This place is so cute! I used to looove Van Dyke's on Lincoln Road, so I was very upset when it closed years ago. I'm so happy that Cafe Roval exists now! The food is delicious! The vegan and vegetarian options are fantastic. We had the sprouted chickpea cakes, which are delicious - I recommend. Then my mom had the vegan option, which is a stir fry, which she loved and I had the seafood special which was shrimp in polenta. Everything was super yummy and my mom has gone back 3xs already! Definitely a staple for us now. Also, the homemade iced teas are fantastic - I had the cucumber-lemon grass and it was so refreshing and light. The service is also very nice, informative and they go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable experience. Definitely check this place out, it's super charming and delicious. Also make sure to walk around the restaurant to see the patio in the the back and the pond!"

They have rotating specials that are reasonably priced. Come and support this gem in Downtown Miami!"

We found the House of Food Porn accidentally in Little Haiti because we wanted to try something new. Being a foodie I was curious about the name, so I made a reservation for a private shushi (YES THIS IS THE NAME!) tasting. What a culinary dream adventure, my friends loved the unique concept of stuffing sushi rolls with cooked home made food of all countries in the world. We tried the German, French, Swedish, Caribbean, Vegan, Cuban roll and had mini chocolate lava cakes with vanilla ice cream for dessert, so so so super yummie!!  Chef Frank made us feel welcome & home in his kitchen, it was a great experience and next time we will for sure order his catering for our anniversary!!!"

We made a reservation for a private birthday party at the House of Food Porn and we were just amazed how cool the spot works. Chef Frank creates rolls with all different kind of flavors, it was super yummie. We loved the Mac'n cheese roll, the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp roll and the Virginia crabcake roll toped with red Seaweed pearls these little explosions made our palate jump with joy!!! Our hostess made sure we always had water, wine and more important FUN, WE HAD A BLAST!!! Also our vegan friend was not left behind, Chef created spontaneously a veggie Tapioka roll with black beans, sweet potatoe, chiyote and roasted beets inside, even we loved this one!!! Dessert was insane, lavacake with molten chocolate core crowned by vanilla ice cream. We had the whole restaurant for ourselves, took pictures in front of the House of Food Porn wall of fame :-))) Highly recommend this speakeasy place, definitely a must to check it out! Thank you Frank & Nicky, we had a great time!"

My family and I got there as soon as it opened and we had lunch. We don't eat meat and there are lots of vegetarian options. I ordered the veggie burger and my dad ordered the vegan jambalaya. It's was PHENOMENAL! The service was great too. Def going again very soon!
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",11/3/2017,$$,5,Lokal,Great vegan options!! Black bean burger and vegan jambalaya on point. Also vegan ice cream sandwich next door at Vickis!!
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",8/13/2016,$$,5,Lokal,"The ambiance here is great.  Very relaxed chill vibe.  My coworkers have been coming here a lot ,  I finally got the chance to join them this week.  They have a number of vegetarian/vegan options here!  I had the vegetarian burger without mayo and cheese... Delicious !! You can also choose regular or sweet potato fries or mixed.  I went with the mixed.  ,Other vegetarian/vegan options include a vegetarian jambalaya and vegetarian tacos.  Try also have brown rice and local vegetables from the sides menu.  ,For the meat lovers... I've heard the burgers are one of the best in Miami!u"
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",8/17/2017,$$,4,Lokal,"Guacamole seemed like it was from a container. The chips were not fresh, definitely bagged. But the sandwiches, burgers, and vegan jambalaya were fantastic! Great bread!"
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",3/18/2018,$$,5,Lokal,I was happy that they had some vegan options.   Vegan Jambalaya was amazing.  I wish they had a Vegan bun option so I could have sampled the Vegan Burger without having to make it a lettuce wrap......
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",12/29/2017,$$,5,Lokal,"Went here because I heard their vegetarian/vegan options were outstanding and I have had trouble finding great veggie options in Miami thus far. Lokal did not disappoint! I had the Veggie Burger, which honestly exceeded my expectations; the menu description sounded pretty good, but when it came to the table, I had to think twice because it had the charred-and-pink look of a medium-cooked burger. It was damn delicious--if you have tried the Beyond Burger, it is similar to that, which I was not expecting. The sweet potato fries were also on point. My husband got the Vegan Jambalaya (we were especially excited for this because that's his fave dish, but can be difficult to recreate vegetarian), and it was insanely good. The vegan Andouille sausage they use was crazy good, and the spice level was great.,The hostess and waiter were very friendly and helpful. We came on a Thursday night around 6:15pm expecting that it would be empty-ish, but it was already full. Can't wait to come back for that burger again!"
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",9/24/2017,$$,5,Lokal,"Absolutely love this place!! Located right in Coconut Grove, Lokal offers fantastic food with an even more awesome theme. With an 80's vibe, you can get a nice cold one from local Miami breweries and enjoy the great finds they have on their menu! Vegetarians are even welcome: I had their Black Bean Burger (so delicious) and tried their Vegan Jambalaya. Both I have to say were made very well and I would definitely see myself coming back again. The service here is very friendly and attentive. One thing I love about this place is their involvement with other local companies in the area. ,Keep up the good work and I'll be back real soon!"
"4545 NW 7th St, Miami, FL 33126",12/5/2017,$,4,G Spot,"I'm glad that i found this little G spot. Best sandwiches in town. They are vegan friendly and they have a great selection of juices! They have a great variety of cheeses, meats and vegetables."

Knight Center downtown Miami, in walk g distance was was a plus, cute restaurant and decent food!  I'm vegan so had limited choices but overall was a nice place with good service!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",9/4/2015,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"We needed a place like this in Miami. Portions are perfect. The menu is varied and caters to vegans/vegetarians/health conscious eaters. The service is fast and the prices reasonable for the quality of what you get. Everything is so fresh and light. The ambiance is welcoming, unassuming and transparent. ,Honestly I can't say one negative thing about Jar + Fork. Keep up the good work!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",6/3/2015,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"I've been here twice.  The first time I popped by for a menu on the way back from an appointment.  They didn't have a menu yet and they were closing up so they literally just gave me like 4 different items to take and try- gratis.   The curry soup was my absolute favorite.  I went back another day and purchased a soup and sandwich combo at a very reasonable (especially for downtown) $12.  Of the now 6 items I've tried, they were all delicious.  They have a variety of new items daily with many vegetarian and even vegan options, but there were still some good meat options.   So excited to see a healthy and delicious new option in downtown!!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",11/5/2015,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"Everything you're looking for in a vegan-friendly restaurant. The food is incredible, the options are vast and delicious, and the service is excellent. Everything I've had here has been amazing!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",7/29/2015,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"I can't stop eating here. Such a breath of fresh air for downtown workers on their lunch break.    The menu changes everyday with all locally sourced ingredients. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options along with things like miso-lemon grilled salmon, ahi tuna poke, curry roasted butternut squash, cranberry quinoa salad, turkey-BLT with avocado on Zak the Baker bread, etc. Everything I have tried has been so fresh and flavorful. On top of it all, the staff is SO FRIENDLY AND CHEERFUL. I almost forget I'm in Miami."
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",10/13/2015,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"Not as many vegan options as I was hoping for, but excellent nonetheless! I ordered the veggie sandwich, side salad, and a watermelon basil juice. Healthy, savory, vegan and delicious! Great service, knowledgeable and from friendly staff. Highly recommended for a healthy, tasty meal."
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",3/18/2016,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"Absolutely amazing! I'm vegan, so it's really hard for me to find good restaurants in the area with good vegan food. Everything was great: food, ambiance, service. Loved it!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",2/27/2016,$$,4,Jar + Fork,The customer service was a 10!  They have out door seating and its very clean and cute. I was happy to see a bunch of vegetarian and vegan options I wasn't a big fan of the watermelon Basil juice ot was good but there was something in there that didn't belong haha but I enjoyed myself
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",3/18/2016,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"Awesome to find a Paleo friendly place this close to Brickell and Downtown!  Dot be confused by the designation as ""vegan"" they absolutely serve high quality meats in addition to vegan fare. I'll be back!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",2/17/2017,$$,4,Jar + Fork,"Great little spot on the corner in down town. Most of the food is vegan but they have steak, chicken and salmon. Its simple: pick your protein, rice bowl or sandwich and pick 2 sides (including soup and salad)!! They make it fresh and bring it to you! Absolutely delightful! Everyone's super nice and the music has an old school vibe. Everything had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but I loved it and I don't like spicy food. Loved this place. Will come again!! Ooh and the cookies!!!! Must have!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",9/10/2016,$$,4,Jar + Fork,"Great place to eat a nice healthy meal in the downtown area, quick service and helpful staff. Would recommend coming here. Vegan options are available."
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",6/17/2017,$$,3,Jar + Fork,"I bought vegan food there. It's ok, nothing special. I do believe that the non vegan food probably taste much better. Everyone around me seemed to be eating salmon, which actually looked really good."
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",1/6/2018,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"What a great place! First time here in this downtown Miami restaurant.  Service is order at counter then they bring to your table. The server explained in detail the concept of the restaurant and menu.  All the food is fresh, and prepared daily! There are great vegan and vegetarian options as well as paleo, and straight up American foods like salmon and burgers. ,I have been in Miami and Fort Lauderdale for 3 weeks and this is my favorite place. ,The food was super fresh,vegetables were cooked to perfection with very light yet flavorful sauce. The vegan soup of the day was ginger carrot with coconut milk base. We ordered one to share and they split in two bowls.  One order was plenty for two to share. And the flavor was just great! Subtle with just the right hint of ginger.,We also shared the paleo plate with two sides. Generous portions again.  We chose the broccoli & cauliflower and jasmine rice for sides and the flavor again, was just perfect. ,Will definitely be back. My only minor concern is the music was too loud.  I didn't say anything but given the excellent customer service, I am sure they would have fixed it. ,I believe they are only open til 4 pm otherwise would definitely go back for dinner since last night in Miami! ,This is my number one casual restaurant in Miami!"
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",12/16/2017,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"On of my favorite restaurants in Miami! Food is always consistently amazing, the vegan kale salad is to die!"
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",1/7/2017,$$,5,Café Roval,Creative food for meat lovers AND vegans. Top notch wait staff. Very affordable.  Lovely surroundings. An escape from reality.
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",3/30/2017,$$,4,Café Roval,"Super atmosphere, great service, pleasant food. Vegan dish of the day: Huge bowl of pasta with a few veggies in it...c'mon, you can do better!,Over all: will definitely come back for the restaurant's beautiful setting."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2017,$$,5,Café Roval,"If you want to sweet your woman off her feet this is defenetly the place to do it!! The scenery is that of something out of a movie. If you do go I would strongly suggest to make a reservation around 7pm if you want to get an outside seat (Note: The outside seating cannot be reserved but the reservation helps out a lot). The staff gave excellent service and the food was delish. My GF is a vegan and I'm not gonna lie, her vegan dish of the night tasted better than the filet minon I got ( To clarify the Filet was still amazing!!). I would defenetly recommend this for any couple looking for something new! I will defenetly be going back for another date night."
"270 E Flagler St, Miami, FL 33131",6/25/2018,$$,5,Jar + Fork,"This little gem of a place blew me away. So much flavor, quality, price, SERVICE, everything works so harmoniously! Portions are decent sized as well. Have nothing but praises for this one. Will definitely recommend and be back for more. Highlights: Brussel Cauli stir fry, Sweet Chili Green Beans. For my vegans out there: you will find some great options here. Management/owners sure got it right here. You can sense an attention to detail in every element. Very happy camper."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",3/15/2017,$$,5,Café Roval,"I really enjoyed this lovely place. I had the vegan linguini and it was delicious!!! We also tried the brussels,Sprouts and they were amazing. The ambience and the staff were just superd. Definitely one of the best places in Miami."
"5556 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",1/17/2008,$$,4,Soyka,"The food is excellent.  They offer all kinds of interesting, gourmet, selections of classic favorites.  They have this Mac and Cheese that's just scrumptious!!!  They can cater to anyone's taste, from Vegan's to Carnivores!  ,Their Sunday Brunch is to die for!  A little pricey...  Sometimes a long wait.  But for the most part, worth it.  They offer the best of breakfast with a great ambiance to go with it!,The decor is lovely - urban and hip (industrial warehouse feel).,The bar area is very trendy and hip, lots of locals come to gather here.  They have an outside lounge area that I knoew they were in the process of revamping/updating to make it a total lounge."
"5556 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",12/28/2014,$$,5,Soyka,"I've been coming here for years, and it remains my favorite restaurant in all of Miami.  What I like about it is that it is an extremely well-rounded place:  it's great for a date, it's great for a special occasion, it's great when you're dressed up, it's great when you're very casual, it's great for groups, it's great when you're by yourself.  This flexibility extends to the menu.  It's not an overwhelming menu, but it has a little of almost everything, and most folks, even picky eaters, vegans and discerning foodies, would be hard-pressed to not find something in the menu of their liking.  ,Yes, like EVERY restaurant, the kitchen sometimes swings a strike, but by and large, the food is almost always exquisitely prepared with fresh ingredients.  They have live music most evenings and for Sunday brunch they feature an excellent piano player of the highest caliber specializing in Cuban Danzón, although his repertoire is also diverse.,One of the great attributes of Soyka is that it is a family-owned and operated restaurant, with very low turnover in its staff.  Very impressively, the owner's two children, a brother and sister duo, work there also, and not as managers ordering people around, but as bartender, servers and hosts, busting their behinds on late nights and weekends (where else in Miami would you find this?).  Their work ethic is exemplary and they are two of the nicest, down-to-earth people one could meet.  Kudos also to Alan, the general manager, for running a tight ship.,I would definitely recommend Soyka to local and visitor alike.  You will not be disappointed."
"2200 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/27/2016,$$,5,Bunbury,"Amazing ambiance, with great decoration! There is a wide rage of wines. Nice to hang out with friends, grab a wine and enjoy delicious food! ;) It's very vegetarian friendly, but not vegan, it would be great to add some vegan options as well! Glad to have a great Argentinean restaurant in town!"
"3540 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",10/16/2016,$$$,5,Ariete,"I don't know where to start with this place. Went out with my date and she can be a challenge when it comes to her diet. I called a day ahead. Asked if they had choices that are vegan and dairy free. The chef said of course,  come on in and we'll take care of you...,He made an entirely separate menu for her... from scratch. ,The guy is a genius with food... Simply a genius, and I'll definitely come back here again. The entire evening was beyond pleasant thanks to the restaurant and its staff."
"165 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",2/14/2017,$$,5,The Butcher Shop,"First entering the restaurant was a great experience because of the greta vibe and layout. The service was top notch, waiter took it upon himself to make sure that my food was vegan. My veggie burger was amazing and my girlfriend had the lobster mac and cheese and she loved it. Overall too good to be true!"
"313 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/12/2018,$,3,The Taco Stand,"Tacos are solid, not great, but good. Had one of each taco, and surprisingly, the cactus vegetarian/vegan option was the best. The others weren't bad, they just need a little something."
"313 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$,5,The Taco Stand,"This is the best taco spot in wynwood. Every bite just makes you want more. Every time I come here I have the al pastor (pork) and I try a different one. I've had the Baja fish and the shrimp and they are super good. The guacamole is off the chain and super chunky. The carne Asada tacos are what keeps me coming back. I will definitely be chasing this taco spot over any of the other ones In wynwood. They also have vegan/vegetarian options! ,Ps- they also make everything right when you order so everything is very fresh."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/2/2012,$$,4,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"I really like this place, great salads, an awesome burger and plenty of options for anyone (well I'd have to check for vegans). It is an order at the counter place that brings food to the table, which I love because it means their prices are fair without wait staff overhead. The ambiance is great and the covered outdoor seating is nice when it isn't too windy."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/10/2012,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"This may be an unfair review because I have only ever ordered the vegan pad thai but I have to say it is phenomenal. I find myself craving it at times ... that's how good it is.,I'm not a fan of tofu but the pad thai comes with it on top. The tofu looks like nothing special and kinda gross, in general (that's how I feel about tofu overall), however the way it's flavored is really pretty good. The noodles, however, are just amazing and fresh. It's just so amazing.,My partner regularly orders the mofongo and switches up the meat that goes with it. He finishes it every time (which is a feat because the portions are HUGE). ,I loved how casual it was relatively comfortable the atmosphere is. As is true to Wynwood it's more trendy-hipster-chic than anything, but it was nice because the food and alcohol selection was legitimately delicious and impressive.,Also, there is a wide array of choices so it's not just strictly amazing mofongo, like I said, I had pad thai but then there are also salads, sandwiches, bizarre yet delicious appetizers, etc.,It's a must and I will be back."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/22/2017,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,The food at jimmyz is always great. We gone there with bunch of friends many times and it's always a fail safe restaurant. When I used to eat seafood (now a vegan) use to get the ahi plate or sandwich and it was amazing. The price is decent and the people there are friendly and very helpful.
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/8/2016,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,Hipster ambience with great Puertrican fusion food and vegan options. Owner is most of the time on-site ensuring service and food quality is to his high standards.
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/26/2018,$$,3,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"Vegan stir fry wasn't my fave, but the rice and beans were vegan and good! Husband liked his Cubano sandwich!"
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/3/2018,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"Had the Ahi Tuna Special, was amazing! So flavorful and just the kick I was looking for. Their Vegan soup is delicious as well. Staff was super friendly, restaurant was SPACIOUS and extremely cool (which was good)! Great beverage and beer options! Will return soon! Keep it up Jimmy'z!"
"500 Brickell Key Dr, Miami, FL 33131",5/22/2016,$$$,5,La Mar by Gaston Acurio,"We picked the perfect place to celebrate our son's graduation. The food was superb, the pisco sours and Chilcanos amazing, the ambiance perfect and the service beyond our expectations! They realized without us mentioning it that we were celebrating our son and they took it upon themselves to bring him out a complimentary dessert. They went out of their way to accommodate the vegan diet of one in our party and we're just all around kind and attentive.  Everything we ordered was delicious! From the Anticuchos to the causa and jalea, and to top it off the Fideos Machos were simply amazing!! Thank you La Mar for a perfect lunch!"
"218 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/15/2018,$$,4,GK Bistronomie,I'm not a huge fan of Peruvian cuisine but this place certainly changed my mind.  It's one of just a handful of places that I have been to that offer a vegetarian/vegan ceviche.  I went with my family and everyone gave it a thumbs up.  Portions even for appetizers are on the larger spectrum of things.  There are several tapas here so you can have fun trying a few things out at once.  Street parking only which is typical for this area.  Had a nice time and would return.  The brunch menu opens up the restaurant to even more choices and prices are reasonable.  More of a fusion than a hard core Peruvian restaurant and I think that makes it more desireable.
"15 Se 10th St, Miami, FL 33131",5/9/2013,$$,3,Perricone’s Marketplace & Cafe,"I know its Miami, but still expensive for what it was.  For $8 per dessert, and looking at them in their market, I was expecting something amazing.  They were only OK.  Not terribly vegan/vegetarian friendly.  I had the spinach salad without the chicken or cheese so I spent $18 for some spinach basically.  I know some reviewers will have a different experience since they're not vegan, but for a vegan/vegetarian person, I'd pass.  Food was OK, but not worth the price."
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/1/2015,$$,3,Joey’s,"Food was good! Dined with 4 teenagers, 1 vegan, & 1 pescetarian! There was something for everyone!  Only caveat:  Service was lacking.  Was seated immediately, which was a plus, but waiter took his time to serve us water, didn't say hello, not very pleasant(young guy).  Waitress that took the order, nice/friendly, but overwhelmed by the crowd(NYE during the day).  She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. Had to wave down someone to get us more water. Had to ask for the bill, then waited forever for her to bring it, then pick it up!  It's a small venue, the place was packed quickly, but it was surprisingly & refreshingly quiet.  We could actually hear ourselves in conversation!"
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/25/2009,$$,4,Joey’s,"Located in the middle of semi-gritty yet artsy design district, Joey's is a small 'upscale' yet laid-back Italian restaurant...perfect for a business lunch or simply a lunch date. Waiters in red are attentive and take initiative, we had breadcrumbs on our table and one of the bus boy wiped it clean so we could resume hand-fondling tabletop!  The bossman came by to make sure we are taken care of when the lunch crowd trickled in. Food was thoughtfully prepared. Soup of the day was mushroom soup (vegan, no cream used but still creamy. Pureed consistency), served with olive oil drizzled in a smiley face. I recommend eating it with the bread; feel free to ask for more if you run out! Papardelle with crabmeat and mushroom was creamy yet subtle. Trofie (little corkscrew pasta) with meat sauce - WIN! Portions were huge for lunch, there was leftovers for dinner!,Soup - $5,Entrees- $15 each,I would come back here if I am in the area...enjoy! ,Tip-bits:,Street parking available right outside Joey's,Lunch menu available with decent portions,Accommodations for big groups gladly made"

The portions are pretty big tho, so I would go on an empty stomach.  The dessert was not as great, however if your coming here you're more than likely coming for an arepa. The yuca fries are also very yummy! They also released that they have expanded their menu to include vegan options!! Very excited to check those out on my next visit!"
"7281 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/28/2017,$$,5,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"Amazing! Delicious food, great selection of wine/beers, accommodating to vegan/conscious eaters and the staff is very customer service oriented!

"28 NE 29th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/25/2017,$$,3,Morgan’s Restaurant,"Walking in the place looked really nice and cool. Did not appreciate having to wait in a line to be seated. Then it took a while for the server to even acknowledge that we were here and the service was good not great. My girlfriend really enjoyed the raspberry French toast, giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. My vegan burger was not great it was fine. Knowing that it is hard for most places to accommodate vegans is hard, but either way not many options to choose from and it was more mediocre than anything."
"223 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",5/28/2017,$$$,5,Alter Restaurant,"So, so good! We came here with friends and it was one of the best places we've eaten at in Miami. Most of our party was vegetarian and Alter had a wonderful vegetarian/vegan menu (the restaurant is tasting menu only - either 5 or 7 courses). ,Everything was super fresh and I like that they source everything locally so the menu is constantly changing and evolving. We didn't have to wait too long between courses which is nice so dinner didn't feel like a marathon. ,The presentation was beautiful and creative, it reminded me a bit of Alinea. ,I highly recommend and will definitely be going back!"
