"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",10/9/2017,$$,4,Cocowhip,"Yummy vegan froyo. Hailing all the way from Australia, this chain found its way to Brickell and I'm glad it did. I liked their original and chocolate flavors, so I was really excited when they said they'd be rotating the chocolate out the next week for matcha. But after coming back a few times and it was still chocolate, I lost faith and the post-run habit (probably for the better though considering one bowl will easily set you back $10). Also considering its location inside an eatery with 100 Montaditos (Spanish tapas place) and Kai (poke and ceviche place), it's a convenient dessert spot to treat yourself every now and then."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",12/10/2016,$$,3,Cocowhip,"Located inside the 100 montaditos, cocowhip is a small yogurt option with about six topping options. Although its a little steep in pricing. We paid $18 for two yogurts with about 2 toppings each. The yogurts are vegan so they melt quickly. The consistency isn't as thick as you'd expect. ,The nice part is that there is outdoor seating, bench style and high tops. They also have flat screens tvs; you can watch your sports game. Parking is hard to come by, I parked in the garage at the building next door on se 12 terr."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",6/8/2018,$$,4,Cocowhip,Update - went again to find out the carrot cake isn't  vegan as was previously told on countless occasions. Very disappointing and irresponsible of the staff. I didn't give a low rating because the staff member who went in the back to ensure it was not when we asked him for the vegan carrot cake was very apologetic when he found out we use to buy the carrot cake because one of the staff told us it was vegan. He offered us a free vegan banana muffin as an apology. Also the cocowhip is still very good and highly recommend it.
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",9/15/2017,$$,3,Cocowhip,"We came here with a friend - after giving into our late night cravings - not realizing it was a vegan, gluten and dairy free kind of place. According to their menu CocoWhip is made with Coconut Water, Organic Bio-Fermented Coconut Powder & Vegetable Sourced stabilizers. There's five CocoWhip variants: Original Coconut, Cacao Bliss, Super Berry, Minty Matcha, African Mango & Turmeric. The Original CocoWhip (their most popular) is more on the neutral side but I added some fudgy brownie bites. If brownies is not your thing they do have a few additional toppings and syrups to choose from. CocoWhip has a very light coco taste (which will go well with any of their toppings), texture was also light, not creamy and had no consistency related to pudding or yogurt. I thought it was quite refreshing. I would like to try their Cacao next time but as for their service, it was very slow. Price wise it was steep (about $6) considering the small size of the cup. My order was made on the spot but my friend ordered the Acai bowl (she did not like the texture) which took about 15 minutes to make! I am willing to give this place another go if I happen to be near-by. Just keep in mind that aside from their soft serve there's not a lot of other dessert choices. And I do agree with a fellow Yelper that my dessert also looked nowhere near what they advertise on their social media. CocoWhip is inside a small section of another restaurant. You have indoor seating and there's also a cute and well lit outdoor seating area. Luckily for us the weather outside was perfect that evening. Too bad my friend didn't enjoy her dessert but I sure enjoyed mine. Hope they're faster with their service next time."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",5/27/2014,$$,5,Yard House,"love the vegan ""wings"" and veggie angel hair.,I really love that they have a Gardein menu for vegetarians and vegans.,(plus so many beers)"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",8/2/2015,$$,3,Yard House,"Came to Yard House for lunch on Thursday. Yard House is a favorite of my office because of the large assortment of food, as well as a very vegetarian and vegan friendly menu. I meanwhile ordered the steak sandwich medium rare and it was absolutely delicious. I enjoy Yard House because of the ambience and the food, but my issue is always the prices. As much as I would like to give it a better review, everything on the menu is just too over priced. That goes double for drinks. Perhaps it is an inflated ego, but I truly believe that Yard House is not a nice enough restaurant to charge the prices they do."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",1/8/2015,$$,4,Yard House,"I actually have mixed feelings about this place. Food is good, but not fabulous... they do have vegan/vegetarianoptions tho. And of course a large variety of beer on tap. But the service is a bit slow, even on days when it's not busy in there."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/30/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"Today I had lunch at yard house Miami beach. Recently, (few months ago) I went vegan and stopped eating all meats and dairy products. I was very disciplined with this until a few weeks ago I started missing being able to dine out without having to ask for an alternative menu. Because I know the dangers of a lot of red meat and hormone in chicken and turkey, I've incorporated only sea food to my diet. ,Yard house offers a rice bowl with chicken and assorted vegetable. I was totally craving this today minus the chicken. I spoke with my waitress who spoke to the manager and switched the protein in my dish for shrimp. I was able to eat what I wanted without the guilt of eating something I knew my body would not be able to handle. It was delicious! Their drinks are also very tasteful. I'm into all sweet and fruity drinks so if I could recommend any I would say have the ""bikini Tini""!  This is a combination of Malibu, banana liquor, pineapple juice and pomegranate. Simply delicious ! ,Oh and needless to say this place is super affordable !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",11/26/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"I've never had a vegan dish like the Gardein Orange Peel ""chicken"" at Yard House. I've been there a total of three times now, I always get the same thing and every time it gets better. I wish it was closer to me but that also saves me money. The waiters do their best and always keep an eye out for you too. I can't wait to try their new vegan burger next time! Yard House has something for everyone!"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/29/2017,$$,5,Yard House,One of the best restaurants in Coral Gables. Many vegetarian and Vegan options. The restaurant gets super packed so make sure you make a reservation. Food is very nice quality.
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/9/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Our server Jade enhanced our experience with great knowledge on the menu and a pleasant attitude. She checked on us just the right amount of times, she knew plenty of information on our vegan and vegetarian options, and she was check ready and did not have to go print the check because she already had it with her. I used to work at Bahama Breeze which is a disaster compared to this Yard house! My favorite part is how much variety they have in their Gardein vegetarian menu and how easy it was to make those plates vegan. Being a vegan is difficult sometimes because most restaurants usually cater to vegetarians. I will definitely be coming back here again for any special occasions so that I can enjoy a good vegan plate."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/15/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Let me start off by saying, WHY have I not been here before! Food, service, atmosphere, everything was amazing! So I came here because as a new vegan I've been wanting to check out places that offer vegan dishes but also offer meat for my boyfriend. I am so glad, I decided to come here. VEGAN burger was absolutely amazing with a kale Caesar salad to die for. Kat, our server was so great and was able to recommend things for me and help me out with the menu. My boyfriend has the Lamb burger, and he loved it (beware of the spicy jalapeño sauce). I loved it and we will definitely be back! ,Thanks KAT !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",5/28/2017,$$,4,Yard House,"Excellent lunch choice as a destination or as a break while shopping at the mall or post workout from the local gym. Loved that there's a gardein section for vegetarian and vegan friendly palettes. Got the guacamole, the poke nachos, the gardein vegan burger, and the gardein bbq chicken pizza. Luckily the place was quiet (just opened for lunch) when we arrived. The staff was attentive and prompt. All the dishes were amazing. Sat indoors which was dark but  comfortable. Outdoor seating is also available. Kitchen and staff are doing a very good job with creating flavorful dishes and an overall nice experience."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",9/19/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"5 STARS FOR MIAMI'S BEST KEPT SECRET VEGAN SPOT,They offer a solid vegan menu featuring Gardein and Daiya products, and the servers have always been willing to double check and verify whether certain items are vegan and whether others can be made vegan. As long time vegans, this is our go to restaurant, and we've never been disappointed."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",3/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"We love this place.  They have Vegan options that are Yummy, a wide range of Beer and a full bar.  The service is always excellent and the price is very reasonable for the location and ambiance."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I like yard house because they have a vegetarian section of the menu that uses gardein products. Most of these options can be made vegan really easily- I've never had a server who couldn't help me make a nice meal. I usually get fried ""chicken"" wings with fries. Not healthy at all but the place also has over 100 beers on tap, and it's a sports bar, so I'm going all out anyways. The chips and guac come with cheese sprinkled on top- so make sure to ask for no cheese if you're vegan. They also have the option of fries, truffle fries (has cheese), or sweet potato fries with most meals."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/20/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I'm vegan //// got an awesome vegan blackened Gardein chicken avocado sandwich. You have to ask for it without mayo and cheese but it's pretty yummy. ,The Gardein chicken is really convincing! Even my non-vegan friends liked it."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/10/2018,$,4,Spice N Curry,"Spice N Curry is an Indian Grocery Store that also serves cooked Indian food from its small cafe in the back.. but from the looks of it, you wouldn't know that they serve food. The cooked food is the reason I've been coming here for the last few years. It's located in one of my favorite strip malls that also includes Vegan & Juice and Chinese Guy.,The food here is very tasty and authentic and the portions are generous. They have a small menu which includes items such as samosas, naan, and some other items that I have been offered as samples. The server here is friendly and always willing to conversate. My favorite entree is their Goat Biryani which is large enough for 2 meals.,The other day I discovered some fresh squeezed Indian bitter-melon juice in a green bottle in their fridge for only $5.99.. another reason to come here. The best way to describe this is nature's medicine and it's said to fight cancer, treat diabetes, regulate blood sugar, and treat a host of other common and/or serious conditions. All I know is that it's super healthy, but most people won't like the taste.. it tastes fine to me. You just take a shot of it each day (and don't overdo it because too much of anything can be bad for you) and the bottle lasts for about a week."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/6/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"I am a huge Indian food fan and Spice and Curry is awesome! They have a small cafeteria in the back of a grocery store and about 12 people can fit on their counters and wait to be fed deliciousness. Their meal combos range from $7 to $9, and i normally get their vegan option. I leave w leftovers all the time. Do yourself a favor and visit this hidden gem!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/28/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"A plus plus all around!! I'm recently vegan and this place offered such a good variety of flavor - all in one dish! I ordered the vegan curry and was surprised at how much food I was given (I couldn't even finish, so I took some home). The meal includes rice and a salsa on the rice, two lentils, naan, and another hard bread (sorry I'm not too familiar with the food names) and a drink, all for $8! This is definitely another hidden gem in Miami. Side note - the home made vegan turmeric cookies are amazing too!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/10/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,I'm so glad my boyfriend took me to this restaurant. I had the vegan curry and for $8 I had one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had in my life. It comes with plenty of food and different flavors. The naan bread from here is so delicious as well!
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/7/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"Great food! I had the Chicken Curry meal that was very filling. My girlfriend had the vegan cauliflower and potato curry. The meals come with rice, naan bread, lentils/chickpeas and a drink. There are also a variety of snacks and drinks. All in all two big thumbs up."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",4/22/2014,$$,3,Pincho Factory,"Came to Pincho Factory for lunch only to experience they were having maintenance issues and would be opening two hours after scheduled time. I was bummed about it and just headed over to Sarussi that is located on the same shopping strip. After lunch and on my way to the car, we notice Pincho Factory is indeed open so we head in at least for dessert. The minute we walked in, I smelled burger juice...like the grease. Maybe it's because my husband is vegan and I've been turned off of meat a little but no lie the smell did slightly gross me out. ,For dessert, there were two options- an Oreo Pie and a Nutella Smore's Pie and they are provided by Sweetness Bake Shop. By the sounds of it, the Nutella would have been my choice but I'm glad we got one of each because the Oreo ended up being the better of the two. Although it didn't blow me away, it was alright- It must have been tucked away in the coldest part of the fridge cause it was a little hard and mega cold on my teeth. ,Hoping I can come back to Pincho Factory soon to update my rating and actually judge them by their own food and not that of their bakeshop."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",9/19/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"5 stars for their vegan toston burger!!! This is not the mediocre, frozen veggie patty I'm used to from non vegan burger joints. It's made from scratch and is SO perfect sandwiched between two tostons."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",3/30/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"This is a place that surprised me. A pincho is meat on a stick so I originally expected just that. Secondly I expected typical greasy, bland tasting fast food. The kind that requires mayo, mustard and ketchup for moisture and taste. But I was delighted to find great flavors and interesting meals. This is fast food taken to the next level. The flavorful level. It's as if someone opened a fast food restaurant but had training at French Cordon Blue. In fact, the only typical ""fast food"" about this place is the furniture. My daughter raves about the burgers especially the toston burger. Which is a feat in itself to make it tasty and to keep it's shape. She licks her fingers every time. There is also a vegan burger that I hear converts people. I am trying all the bowls one by one, having difficulty choosing one. They offer fresco, california, tex-mex, latin, chimichurri, Mediterranean style of bowls, salads and wraps with four choices of delicious proteins. But DO NOT expect anything typical. So far Im favoring the cali because of the mandarins, almonds, gorgonzola cheese and mango sauce.  Omggggg. And the portions are so generous. You will not leave hungry. You can also get hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. Apparently they have award winning fries, and yuppppp: pinchos!!! And a surprisingly great selection of beers and IPAs. I keep telling myself I'm going to get a pincho one day but then I walk in and see the menu and there's just too many great choices. I have a feeling though that they too are probably delicious. The only item I considered just ok were the sweet potato taters. But I am a huge sweet potato lover who believes it should be paired with salt not sweet. And you gotta give them some area to grow. Lol. Also Im always crazy full by the time I get to the taters. So yeah. That."
"8575 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/9/2017,$$,4,Duffy’s Sports Grill,"If you want to watch sports, especially soccer, this is the place. There are TVs in literally every wall (even in the bathroom), and the place is new, well lit, and clean. They have 2x1 drinks if that's your thing, and a couple of vegan/vegetarian food options on the menu (yay!). The only quibbles are that parking is hard to find, and that the food and service takes a little long."
"1800 SW 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33129",4/15/2018,$,5,Cure Cafe,"Love love love. I live in the building right above here and have made it a ritual to get breakfast here at least once every weekend. I enjoy their witty signs they have on the wall and out front. The ingredients are fresh and the menu is all organic healthy stuff, which I love especially the morning after a night out. I always get smoothie #2 with vegan protein added and the avocado toast. Recommend to anyone who likes good tasting food thats also good for you."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/29/2016,$$,5,Aoki Teppanyaki,"I love this place. They have happy hour all day every day except evenings on the weekend. The music they play is great.  Their brussel sprouts, eggplant miso, chicken salad, kimchee pork, sweet corn, triggerfish jerky, firecracker shrimp and aoki slider are all amazing.  They have cool things like chicken hearts and beef tongue too which I am into.  Definitely try the chicken liver!!!! The sushi is fresh, I like their salmon and ikura donburi.  The soft shell crab roll is good. Many items on the menu ate vegetarian and vegan friendly which is awesome.  Honestly I have never even tried their teppan because the individual dishes are so good. The service is also excellent. Everyone is very attentive, dishes are brought out quickly and the management is caring.  This is my go to happy hour spot."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",4/1/2016,$$,3,Aoki Teppanyaki,"The Teppanyaki part of Aoki is awesome 5 star super delicious super reasonable and the chefs are friendly and entertaining.  I've experienced the Teppanyaki twice for lunch and it has not disappointed. They make the BEST mixed rice I've ever had in my life (no kidding). However, I decided to try their Sushi Happy Hour as they advertise some really good deals $5-$7 plates and drinks.  I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi was good, decent but not mind blowing.  Service can sometimes be slow and not streamlined though friendly enough.  Great vegan option is the laughing Buddha roll, no sacrifice in flavor and it's very light. I'm also a big fan of the kama kama (whitefish and salmon  cheeks)."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",9/13/2016,$$,5,Aoki Teppanyaki,"I love to be able to go places that offer a vegan option and aoki does just that! The farmers selection is so delicious and filling! All types of veggies! Aoki is one of my favorite restaurants, its amazing and i recommend it to everyone! There lunch deals are the best"
"3201 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/7/2018,$$,4,MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company,The variety of pizza options were great. They have the best vegan pizza in Miami. Super tasty you wouldn't know it's vegan. They have 4 calzone options and will let you add toppings to it as well. The wine selection is good as well. Great for lunch and dinner with a beautiful romantic ambiance. Very clean restaurant and bathrooms.
"3201 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/5/2018,$$,5,MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company,"Delicious vegan GF pizza, excellent service! Really enjoyed the warm welcome and the free calzone on my first visit ! The manager also helped bring my to go order out to the car"
"5759 Bird Rd, Coral Terrace, FL 33155",10/26/2017,$$,3,Matsuri,"I wanted to try this place since many people say the food is good there. I'll be honest, after reading other reviews, I was expecting rude service. And, I got it. I'm a vegan so I'm used to the rudeness that can sometimes come AFTER I tell a server I'm a vegan. But, at Matsuri, the server was rude from the start, before I even mentioned I was vegan. She looked unhappy and inconvenienced by our presence. We were there for lunch and it wasn't that busy. I waited tables for 18 years and one of the things that servers must always do is be nice and at least act happy, even if they aren't. I asked the server if the tofu dish I wanted was vegan and she said she didn't think so and just stopped at that, didn't offer to check, just said she didn't think so. So, I asked her to ask someone and she visibly looked mad that I asked for confirmation. She came back to the table and told me that it wasn't vegan. So I asked what was vegan on the menu and she said that basically nothing there was vegan(not sure if this is true or not) but suggested I get the boiled vegetables. Um, I'm a vegan, not someone with the flu, I don't want boiled vegetables at a restaurant. So, I ordered edamame and a vegetable sushi roll. She immediately told me that the veggie sushi roll wasn't vegan. I asked why. She said that basically everything there was cooked in fish sauce, and that the rice had fish sauce in the way they cooked it. I gave up. I just had edamame. I was tired of inconveniencing her and asking her questions. Usually places with Asian cuisine are suitable for vegans but not this place! Well, maybe it is, maybe another server could have helped me a bit more. Anyway, my friend liked her Okonomiyaki so much so that she ordered another one to take home for her husband."
"5701 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",7/22/2018,$,5,Taco Genius,"Best Vegan tacos!! ,Located inside Sunset Place on the first floor. These tacos are giving ppl a reason to come back to Sunset Place!"

"2121 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/30/2016,$$,3,POC American Fusion Buffet & Sushi,"I am pretty wary of buffets - add raw fish to that and I would get SUPER wary.  However, my vegan-self wasn't too worried on this occasion. ,We took a friend's advice and went during the busiest  time on the weekend - this way you know the food is being turned over and replaced often. Wise advice! ,We pretty much stuck to the sushi section and the salad bar. Upon request, they will make you a vegetable roll, which was nice. We managed to eat our fill, but nothing was incredibly overwhelming. ,It is a great bargain tough if you like buffets and random combinations, like waffles with your sushi for brunch :) The ambiance is quite hectic and family oriented on the weekends."
"41 SE 5th St, Miami, FL 33131",6/12/2018,$$,4,TKO Sushi - A Modern Experience,I love hay the place has a vegan sushi role! Seaweed salad and edamame were great too
"8955 SW 72nd Pl, Kendall, FL 33156",9/22/2017,$$,5,The Brick Restaurant,"This place was sooo gooooodddd. The service was quick and friendly and the food was just amazing. Also very vegetarian friendly, but not so much vegan friendly (I am neither vegan nor vegetarian). Besides that everything was perfect. Overall had an amazing experience and even better food! I definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Food is quite pricey, but most definitely worth it since all the ingredients are from local markets!"
"8422 Mills Dr, Miami, FL 33183",9/18/2016,$,5,Ken’s Healthy Delights,"Recently, decided to go vegetarian and felt like eating a salad yesterday. Kendall doesn't have a lot of healthy or ""vegan"" options so I went to Giardino and realized how ridiculously over priced they are for what they offer and left. In my search I came across this awesome place and was impressed by their price, variety, and veggie selection. I will most definitely be returning to this establishment. So grateful that healthier and affordable ""fast food"" options are opening in Kendall."

Got a chicken salad wrap (more flexitarian for today) and it was awesome!! Also got a dancing princess smoothie that is Delish  and I'm really not a smoothie person. Shannon is great! Never stopped working and cleaning the whole time I was here and let me taste a smoothie she was making for someone else and let them taste the one she made for me. Great way to bring us all back for more because both smoothies were pretty awesome.,I'm feeling amazing already  great choice and will become my new go-to for healthy options. Greatly needed around these parts too."
"5829 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",3/3/2017,$$,3,Tacocraft Taqueria & Tequila Bar,The pork taco. Has no flavor. They need a better selection of hot sauce. Need to bring the Diablo or ghost pepper sauce w.e it's called back. It has a good aesthetic. The seats are uncomfortable. Guac is pretty great. Quesadillas are good. The waiters.. ARE ALRIGHT. Maybe the one I got just gave me attitude?? Or was having a bad day?? Idk. W.e the manager is really nice tho. Found a tag of an avocado in my food. That kinda annoyed me for obvious reasons. I've gone a couple times so I'd say it's worth to try. Also had the guac with the crickets so it's unique lol  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options.

For all my vegans or plant based food lovers, Tacocraft cooks up a delicious sweet potato, kale, sautéed onions, and beans taco that is absolutely yummy! If you decide to arrive for Sunday brunch (Unlimited mimosas and sangria ladies!) the vegan taco is not on the brunch menu but you may request it with your waiter.  Great ambience to hang out with friends but be warned it does get busy and seating his limited so early bird gets the worm."

Their tacos are very popular in this area of Miami, and there are vegan and vegetarian options on the menu (there's a tofu taco option!). ,Although I've only been here once, I definitely will be coming back. Good service, friendly servers, delicious food, vegan/vegetarian options, and great margaritas and mojitos. And strong. ;),The best day to come is Tuesday, but I'm sure it's good any day of the week."

I ordered the kale & sweet potato hash tacos and a mushroom taco without cheese or sauce. Everything was fresh and delicious! Service was fast and staff was helpful and friendly. We sat outside and it was a nice atmosphere and the music wasn't too loud. Definitely recommend!!

"5831 Sunset Dr, Miami, FL 33143",11/17/2017,$$,3,Earth,"I ordered earth for my coworkers and myself for genetic counselor awareness day (we are a genetics department!) I love what earth is doing in providing simple, hassle free, healthy options. One of our physicians is vegan and there were plenty of options available for her as well. I was disappointed because many of the items listed on the menu were unavailable and most of those that were actually delivered were lackluster. The brown soup was bland. The bowls were not very cohesive, and the desserts were not indulgent even when considering the limitations of all vegetable ingredients. Potential to do great things but the items need to be elevated just a little bit. Still glad we didn't order pizza though!"
"45 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",6/21/2015,$$,4,Hibachi Grill & Noodle Bar,They helped me pick out a vegan option. Friendly staff! Definitely am coming again! Right down the street from our hotel. Got a yakisoba with veggies. Bomb!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Recently stopped in here for lunch and the food was delicious! Lots of vegan options and the menu also offers a macro count on each item - so very helpful if you're keto. I got the lemongrass chicken in a collard green wrap and it was one of the best wraps I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/28/2017,$$,5,DIRT,Yum! I'm so happy this opened up in Mary brickell! I have came here every day for the past week and I can't get enough. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade and healthy! I live for the vegan wrap (love the mint) and their tomato soup! I'm super sensitive to sodium but their soup has just the right amount. Portions are huge and the quality is just right for the prices. If you want to only spend $5 go to McDonald's!! Run in and grab a coffee or tea from their coffee bar or walk up and order a healthy organic meal! You won't be disappointed.
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",12/12/2017,$$,3,DIRT,"Love the ambience, healthy food varieties, but wish there were organic options (especially for their eggs). The collard wrap (mai fun vegan wrap) I got was not worth recommending, only part I enjoyed was the sauce. The rest was bland and raw. Don't waste your $5 getting the Adashah as an add on... was advertised as ""amazing"" but honestly more bland than plain polenta. I'll be back to try other things.."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/12/2018,$$,4,DIRT,Decent place with lots of vegan options. Portions are very big. Tomato soup is very yummy :)
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/2/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"They did it again!!!! The food is healthy amazing and has vegan options!  Everything is so yummy!  It's also great because everyone remembers your name and says hello!,My favorites are the dirty vegan salad and the poke Bowl with adashah instead of tuna for vegetarians (although their tuna is high quality and I love it!!!!) and you can't forget the coco chia pudding!!!! I can eat it all day plus if you bring the jar back you get a $1 off the next one!,Today Jeff (an owner who is at the register and greeting guests daily) even offered me to try a new sauce with the adashah (which is an amazing vegan thing to replace meat) it looks and tastes like a filling and yummy cornbread almost... ,I promise you it's the best vegan spot you will ever try and if you're not vegan the rest of the menu plus tuna and chicken are high quality organic with no hormones or anything. The flavors are amazing and it's all made fresh!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/25/2018,$$,4,DIRT,"It's nice having more healthy options in the area. This place is pretty great for the health conscious and is vegan friendly. ,Pros,Great design,Great options,Local food,Great location,Priced similarly for the area. ,Cons,I would skip the coffee bar if you want something high quality. I came for a latte because I saw they had a La Marzocco machine, which is wonderful if you know how to use it. Makes an incredible espresso. Unfortunately the barista didn't have the knowledge to use the machine to its best. I've lived in several coffee cities like Seattle and am use to getting incresibly amazing coffee. So keep in mind you may not care about that if you are usually happy with Starbucks. If you go to Panther or Eternity, you won't find the coffee very good. The bean isn't bad, but it's all for nothing if no one can use the machine well. ,Service-wise, I was a initially surprised that I wasn't offered a new drink, but I didn't mind paying for a new one. The general manager came by eventually and asked if he could remake the drink but it wasn't much better to be honest. Still very foamy milk for a latte that didn't properly blend into the espresso. He also gave me a free Zak the Baker cookie, which was nice and delicious. I would recommend the business invest in barista training with Panther. The coffee bar is a good idea and will be even more worth it if it's the best thing locals can get in the Brickell area."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/22/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Cranberry iced tea is refreshing and made fresh! Matcha pancakes were amazing and vegan :) they guys who work there are super nice!

"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",10/25/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"Fast and friendly service. Servers are very attentive. Delicious options and I love that it is vegan and omni friendly. The best places are the ones we can all get something.,Update. The prices are great for the portions. The dirty vegan salad was way bigger than what I was expecting for the price. This is my go to spot now."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",7/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Let's talk about that Impossible Burger. In the wave of plant-based foods here in Miami, this is by far the most delicious and interesting thing I have experienced. Fairly new to the DIRT menu, it's 100% Vegan and mind-warpingly delicious. It's deliciousness, down to a science. At its center is a vegan patty with amazing texture and maybe even better-than-beef taste -- along with fresh spinach, sliced heirloom tomato, and a perfectly sliced and well placed onion (reminiscent of In-Out-Burger). While still experiencing that primal joy that comes with diving your face into a burger, post meal I walked away with a feel-good stomach, a smile, and maybe even a little bit of that chipotle sauce on my cheek. I left wanting another bite... Do yourself a favor, go get your hands all up on its tasty and puffy vegan buns."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/9/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"This is my kinda place!! The food here was so clean and delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly and the service was fast. I want to try everything off their menu. Lots of paleo, vegan, and vegetarian options to choose from. The interior is definitely ""Instagram worthy"" of you're in to that sort of thing."

"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/29/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Dirt is one of my faves! Dog friendly local restaurant chain with creative healthy cuisine that has plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Also, DIRT offers different meat dishes for the meat lovers! What more could you ask for? ,I first went to DIRT at their original Miami Beach location, and since then I have seen the service and menu improve SIGNIFICANTLY. There are plenty of creative dishes that I haven't even had the chance to try yet, but everything I have ordered from DIRT I have enjoyed. DIRT also provides nutritional info for every dish on their menu (not just calories, but also fat and protein content) so you can make smarter dietary decisions based on your needs. They are very willing and open to accommodations, such as swapping meat or fish for Adashah (a vegan based protein). Adashah is a vegan, nutritious lentil based protein that is made by a local entrepreneur, and it is featured in many of DIRT's dishes. You can even by uncooked adashah from DIRT (sold in their display fridge) so that you can easily cook and customize it at home! I'm a huge fan of adashah, and DIRT is currently the only place I can get it in Brickell (for both cooked and uncooked versions)! ,What I've tried at DIRT Brickell (all were delicious and very filling!) ,Frittata tostada (I got the eggs poached and without sriracha- I can't handle the spice),Clean bowl (subbed turkey bacon for adashah to get a higher protein content, and made the dish vegetarian!),Dirty vegan salad (added adashah for protein) ,Summer poke bowl (sriracha dressing was spicy, so if spicy is hard for you like me, I'd take it off or try something else!) ,Summer adashah plate (surprisingly no customizations for this one!) ,I've also had the açaí bowl here, which wasn't bad, but I'm also picky about these, as I used to work at a smoothie shop that offered marvelous açaí bowls with yummy plenty of different flavors. ,There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at this brickell location. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching in Mary brickell village and has shade. I also really appreciate that DIRT always has complimentary lemon cucumber iced water that is tasty and refreshing! Also, because you order at a counter, you don't have to worry about paying tip at this restaurant!,Dirt has something for everyone, make sure to support your local business and give it a try!"
"5850 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",8/15/2015,$$,5,Taste Buds of India,"This place blew my taste buds of miami away. I think I might just move to India after such a dining experience (or possibly into this place's kitchen). I mean everything hit the spot. I came in hungry and left stuffed off of all vegan dishes with even a box to go. The bismati rice was cooked to perfection and the little fennel candies at the door was icing on the cake. ,It's new so if there's not too many people in the establishment,  don't let that fool you. They have another successful restaurant in coral Springs. ,I can't wait to come back...indian food is officially my favorite type of food nowadays... Thanks TBOI"
"2929 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2016,$$,4,Salsa Fiesta,"This Mexican spot has insanely quick service! I kid you not... Our food came out within less than 5 minutes of ordering. My friend's vegan quesadilla came out within 2 minutes. Fastest. service. EVER. Convenient for when you're starving in the middle of rush hour lol I had the ceviche with tostadas, authentic Mexican sandwich, and chips with this yellow corn-bean based spicy dip (phenomenal). ,The Mexican sandwich was whatever. Super thin piece of fried meat that had been covered in too much batter, so you can barely even consider it meat. The bread is thick so the bread to stuffing ratio was unbalanced.  The ceviche and dip was great! My boyfriend got the fish quesadilla, which had with mahi and cheese on whole wheat tortilla. Large portion in width, but could've had more cheese and mahi stuffed in this one though"

This is not a vegan health food joint if ur looking fancy dinning go else were. If u want good quick food ( the hot dog) this is the place.

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/22/2012,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"best smoothies!, best vegan food in miami!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/27/2010,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I Yelped this place when I was visiting Miami last winter. It looks like a hold in the wall, but is definitely worth it, I promise. Once you make it through the health food store, you will find Carlos at the back counter serving up delicious and healthy vegan fare. He takes the time to chat with the customers, and even got to know me a little bit, which is something I truly appreciate. Nothing like a small business in times of evil corporations, am I right? Carlos is good people. He even let me get behind the counter for a Yelp photo :-) He gets his produce locally from what I could tell when I watched him buy some local fruit from a farmer before my eyes. I also watched him juice a freaking watermelon for me, which was amazing. I had the veggie burger and it was fantastic. Now I need to come back to Miami to visit Carlos and try more of his food."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/3/2009,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I love this place. It has been right around the corner from my house forever and I regret never knowing it. It is great for vegetarians or vegans. They have a ton of natural foods and ingredients for cooking as well as a little bar in the back with natural juices, smoothies, and an interesting variety of vegan/vegetarian meals and snacks. They also have some good dressings and sauces for whatever you order, and the owner/manager is happy to help you figure that out."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It was my first time at this adorable vegan place, and I'll definitely be back. I sat down at the counter, and was trying to read my magazine while waiting for my order, and it was clear that the friendly patrons and chefs weren't going to let me eat alone! The entire counter introduced themselves to me, as well as both chefs behind the bar. Everyone was incredibly friendly, and it felt like I had walked into a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other, but obviously welcomed any newcomer. Surprisingly, some of the patrons ate some meat occasionally. Which, somehow, in a weird way, is reassuring.....if occasional meat eaters love this place, so could I. The head chef gave me a sample of the squash soup, that was amazing, sweet, but not overpowering.  I then ordered the garbanzos and brown rice and 2 slices of baked tofu. It was phenomenal, and had so much flavor. The tofu was crispy and seasoned with something that was out of this world - absolutely delicious. The garbanzos were healthy and so fresh. I added this homemade mango hot sauce and I almost licked the plate. The patron to my right gave me the full low down on the place. Aside from their staple salads, sandwiches, and fruit/vegetable drinks, he explained that Chef Carlos has a daily hot vegetarian meal, that changes every day, but that it's the same meal on Mondays, every Tuesday, etc. But Fridays and Saturdays are the wild card. Chef Carlos makes whatever he wants on those days. I'd definitely go back, again and again. ,After my lunch, I did a little shopping, as I try to support small, local, business any time I can. The prices of the items were better than at Whole Foods, and the store staff was very helpful, making sure I found everything OK. I'd definitely support this establishment, and will encourage my friends to do so as well."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/12/2011,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"My brother and I found this place today for lunch.  On the outside it looks just like a health foods store but in the back is a counter with some stools.  They always have sandwiches and a few other things on their menu then there are the daily specials.  I had soy piccadillo, rice, and kale slaw and my brother had brocolli tofu pie all of which was delicious and vegan.  We shared a slice of his tangerine cake for lunch which was one of the best cakes I've ever had!"

Friendly customer service beyond exceptional and  the food is so tasty you will not realize you're eating healthy ! I'm so glad We drove from Florida City all the way here to give it a try .

Not only did they have vegan options but the owners daughter is vegan, had excellent recommendatins and was very nice. I had the Tori Kimchee Don with tofu and the veggie garden combo plate, both were delicious. He had the Salmon Teribox and the Apollo combo plate, loved both and said it was the best teriyaki salmon he has ever had. ,Everything tasted fresh and of high quality.

The restaurant is in a a strip mall with a vegan restaurant. Dublin Donuts, a liquor store, dry cleaners and a lighting place. The restaurant itself is very small and it has limited seating. They have a huge menu that covers the whole wall as you walk in. I order the tempura JB roll and a California roll (for later). They have a lunch special where you can get 2 appetizers and a drink for an extra $3 with your sushi. I wanted to save my JB roll for when I go home but it looked so good that I ate it in my car. OMG....this is the BEST sushi that I had in a while. The portions are huge and it isn't expensive at all. The service was really nice and the workers were very helpful and friendly. There is parking in the front of the strip mall. ,I will defiantly be back."
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/31/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"I would never fathom that a place called Pincho Factory offered a vegan burger, but lucky for me and other health nuts, it does!  Their bean burger is blended with sweet potato and flour-no eggs here!  It's delicious.  Pair that with their Cajun fries and you got yourself a meal exploding with flavor.,I love their sincere desire to serve customers.  I called to place an order, hesitant as I was certain I wouldn't find anything vegan.  The guy who took my call, Eric, was SUPER affable and courteous.  He described all the ingredients in the burger and even told me to drive safely on my way to pick up my order.  No one has ever wished me a safe drive to pick an order before.  ,My meat-eating colleagues also love this place, so when lunch time comes around, we group up and head over.  I am obsessed with their Cajun fries!  I'll even eat them cold and soggy.  They put caramelized onions on top--yum!,Pincho Factory is quick, affordable, and absolutely delectable!"
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/20/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"Good. Fast food type atmosphere.

I chose a bowl, and I put all of my favorite veggies and things in it. They have a great variety of sauces to choose from, and I tried ALL of them. I also liked that you can have as much hummus as you'd like, it's included in the price. The fries are amazing too, and the bay leaf powder they put made them taste perfectly seasoned. The service was great as well, they made excellent recommendations and were really friendly. I'm so happy I ran into this place. I will definitely be coming back!"

"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",10/22/2017,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Hottest new vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurant on the block. Located in the Sunset Place Mall area, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat if you're looking for something healthy and not too expensive. ,The menu is a little small, since they only sell sandwiches, bowls, fries, brownies, and other variations of the sort with different sizes, but it's all very simple and easy to make. ,There is also delivery available, but from what I've heard it's not yet available through the Yelp app, though it's on its way (I think Postmates and Grubhub have it up though). They also don't do call deliveries because they do not take credit card information over the phone, so it's all mobile through the food delivery apps. ,The restaurant itself is clean and comfortably small. I liked the service and my falafel sandwich was made fresh and quick. You can also add on many different toppings without extra fee. My regular falafel sandwich was about $7. ,The peanut sauce is the best! Delicious sauce to put on your meal, I don't know why I only recently discovered it. I also enjoyed the hummus, jalapeño sauce, and red pepper sauce. ,Definitely a new hot spot for all types of foodies in South Miami, accommodating to many dietary needs."

I ordered a Falafel bowl it comes with 5 falafels and you can add any topping as long as it fits the container. The falafels and toppings are tasty, it's an amazing variety of toppings that you see quite a few things that you normally won't seen in other similar shops, such as fried eggplant, pickled cauliflower etc.  Good place to go for vegans, and someone who is looking for a fast service."

"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",7/19/2018,$,3,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Came to this vegan falafelshop to catch some lunch before I went to work.  Ordered pick up with postmates.  I noticed the menu was so limited and then realized they really only serve falafel (I know what the place is called just thought they would have more options).  ,I ordered for pick up.  Parking is eh since it is sunset place.  I parked in the garage that was next to where Ra used to be.  I walked to the restaurant which the distance wasn't bad at all.  Just crossing the street can be a bit much with traffic.  Made my way to the place which was easily spotted from the street.  ,I ordered and a lot of the items that I put into my bowl I had no idea what it was going to taste like.  I went on pure gut and prayed it would be good.  Honestly it was.  It tasted great.  The falafel was covered with a lot of sauces and hummus and it never became soft.  The falafel kept its crispiness which was surprising because usually with too much sauce the falafel gets soggy.  Not in this case!,When I arrived I noticed that all the items that I put onto my bowl are nicely arranged like a salad bar at the actual restaurant.  I am pretty sure if I would of dined in my experience would of been much better but since I didn't know what I was getting myself into I was conservative in my order.  My complaint about this place is that there really aren't more options for non vegan eaters however it is great for people who are vegan.  ,I will return to try this place again however I will probably dine in instead of ordering out."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",2/4/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Awesome place!  In search of a vegan option for my,nephew's birthday, I found this place.  I'm not vegan but he is so I needed a compromise. Came here for lunch with my nephew and three kids and it was delicious. Place is small and very casual. Nice decor and clean. You have the option to get the falafel in a pita (white or wheat) or a bowl. We ordered three small pitas, two small bowls, and three large fries. ,At first I was a little concerned because the bowls look small (my kids eat), but we could hardly finish everything. The fries were definitely a lot (we ordered three and took two home), but they were so good. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They sprinkle salt and seasoning if you want. They also have a few different sauces to add to your falafel or fries such as tahini, creamy garlic mayo, curry ketchup, ketchup, and a few others that I can't remember. ,Once your order is ready you can top your sandwich or bowl with numerous toppings that are available. It's self serve so you can add as much as you want, but only once. Meaning you can't start eating your sandwich and decide you want more of a specific topping.  They have quite a selection of toppings which I can't remember them all but some are cucumber and onions, baba ganoush, hummus, pickles, cabbage, chick peas, cabbage, a garlicky parsley thing that was delicious and a bunch others.  Oh and the falafels have a nice delicious flavor.  ,Price was decent...for two small bowls, three small sandwiches, 3 large fries and 5 drinks we spent about $65.00. Definitely would be back."

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is amazing!  You could walk by and never even know its there.  The front is a tiny, two aisle grocery store, with vitamins and various vegan and health food items.,In the back there is a small counter where the friendly owner will greet you with samples of whatever he's making that day. When I first walked in he handed me samples of two different types of soup, pasta, and various other dishes.  I ordered the seitan and mushroom pie. AMAZING! It was so good and fresh.  It really had the best flavor and everything in it was cooked to perfection.  I also had the squash soup, which was sweet and creamy and wonderful.  To wash it all down I had a fresh juice- beet, carrot, celery and apple.  Yes, I know this sounds gross, but trust me its not. It is so good for you and the apple pretty much is the dominant flavor.  My sis had ""the rainforest"" which is a fresh juice/smoothie with avocado, banana, and I don't know what else, but it was very good.  ,There isn't a lot of room to sit, only a counter, and two small tables out front.  And the place was packed even though it was a thursday afternoon.  Honestly it is worth it.  I would stand and eat if I had to.  And even though the place was packed we didn't feel rushed by anyone, everyone seemed to be in a great mood.  ,Honestly it was the best eating experience I've had so far in Miami. I would HIGHLY recommend it to vegan and non-vegans alike.  OH did I forget to mention that it was completely vegan? Next time I want to try the apple pie..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/18/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Another Yelp find although I have been familiar with the Beehive for about 25 years, which makes me sound really old but my parents were friends with Bob (owner) and very healthy on top of it.  A lot has changed since then and when I heard about the counter in the back with all vegan homemade food I was game.  Chef Carlos is incredible - I feel like a regular and I have only been once, for take-out! The menu changes daily and you can sample everything before you buy.  I had a lentil soup, empanadas - although they were much more healthy and tasted different than any empanadas I have ever had! I also took a piece of broccoli casserole for lunch the next day.  Everything tasted wonderful (and healthy) and was affordable to boot! Next time I want to find what the delicious looking vegan cakes are since there was a tempting assortment on the counter..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/21/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"We've only tried the juices, so I'm giving the JUICES 5 stars.  Carlos uses unique fresh ingredients that you normally wouldn't think of mixing together to make delicious healthy juices.  We had one combining dragon fruit, mangoes, banana, and apple juice.  Another juice had avocado and ginger among many other fruits that was complex, delicious, and refreshing.  I look forward to going back and trying the food, even though I'm not vegan."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"DELICIOUS.  This is the best Vegan place I've been to in Miami.  The chefs are playful and fun.  They love talking to everyone in the place.  The restaurant has a bunch of loyal customers and for a good reason.  The food is fresh, delicious, and inspired.  I ate a dish called Tres Amigos that came with a sweet cilantro salsa on top with a small salad.  The presentation is simple and lovely.  I had the carrot, beet, celery juice that the other reviewer mentioned and it was DELICIOUS, sweet and nutritious.  ,I am going to make sure that I go back there again and again.  The place is absolutely a hole in the wall, but the service and food is so good that it doesn't matter.  From the outside it looks a little grungy, but that's because the lights aren't that bright and it has dark wood, so it looks a little dirty but everything on the inside is super clean."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/3/2011,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love this place. I come here as often as I can, and usually grab a bite to eat and some empanadas to keep in the fridge. Carlos, the chef is fantastically kind and makes everything fresh every day. It's all vegan, which didn't bother me when I ate meat (it's realllllyyyyy good) and is much appreciated now.,Everything is fresh and home-made. It's all very good. Carlos will let you try anything before you decide what you want. Smoothies and juices are good too. (Spirulina smoothie especially!) I guess some people are put off by how old everything is but I always see everything washed thoroughly and the staff washing their hands all the time. I think people are confusing clutter and age with cleanliness, to be honest. I really don't know what else to say. Just go here. It's delicious, unpretentious and won't make you feel gross after eating."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/25/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Amazing little vegan restaurant in a little health foods grocery store.  Food is so tasty, you know it was made with much love and the price point is ridiculously affordable. My money goes twice to three times as far here compared to other vegan restaurants/restaurants with health conscious choices.  Wish they had a location closer to downtown.  Everything is bomb."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/24/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I absolutely love this place. Mom & Pop vibe. The food is great and the desserts are fantastic! Gotta try their vegan cupcakes! One must definitely try their smoothies. I've had a few of them and they are delicious!  Me fave is the Rainforest :) Also, the market portion of Beehive is fantastic if you're looking for natural products/supplements. This place has quickly become one of fave local markets and food spots! Check it out! :)"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/6/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Call for their specials, soooo worth it.  I had the asparagus soup and kale & brown race cake.  Tiny, non-pretentious, vegan. Love."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/29/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Chef Carlos concocts the most delish vegan dishes. The new and larger location is wonderful. You can eat healthy food and get expert advice on vitamins and supplements at the same time!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/10/2010,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,"Im not Vegan but it was pretty nice.  The owner is awesome and funny as hell.  ,If your Vegan you'll probably love this place...  "" eat with your eyes close"" I was told....."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/26/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Alright, let me kick this off by saying I consider myself hipster to the bone. I mean, I start my day by putting on my horn-rimmed glasses, sparking up a hand-rolled cigarette, riding to work on my fixed-gear bicycle, and then writing reviews on Yelp that have a surprising amount of hyphens in them. None of those things are true except all of them, but the point still stands: hipster to the bone. When I walked into Beehive, however, I felt more mainstream than a migrating salmon. This place is seriously two weeks away from becoming a hippie compound, and I love it. The store itself is alright, stocked with seriously obscure items such as rose scented Dr. Bronner's soap, but just a bit-overpriced as expected. The juice bar/restaurant, however, is where it's at. They have a bunch of handmade vegan dishes, deserts, and, of course, juice, all of which are reasonably priced. You'll pay somewhere around $4 for a juice, $5 for a smoothie, and maybe something like $7 to $12 for a sandwich/main dish. On top of it all, the staff is friendly. As a native from New England, it felt a little bit like a trip to Vermont. While some in Miami who pedicure far too often or who drink creatine like their life depends on it probably won't be fans of Beehive, this place is a gem for those other people who catch obscure references or who grow out their armpit hair probably a bit too much. But, hey, I'm not judging anyone here, I mean, this entire review is basically an explicit judgement, but hey, you know, that's just how the vegan cookie crumbles."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/3/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I landed in Miami last month, and immediately went to Yelp to find a vegan restaurant.  I was on a Daniel Fast and was in need of a meal I would not have to assemble from the sides and veggie options available in a typical restaurant.  Yelp brought me to the Beehive and Carlos and Coco.  This place is a quaint, hole in the wall health food store with the most creative, delicious vegan food I've ever tasted.  Eating there made me believe I could be vegan for the rest of my life!  I'll definitely be going back there when ever I'm in town!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/4/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Yes, it has its quirks. BUT this place has fresh, delicious vegan fare, that has been home cooked with love. Carlos fills it with such positive energy you can't help but smile. It also has a lot of regulars, which gives it a hometown diner feel once you've been there a few times. You'll leave fully satisfied with no food hangover."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/12/2012,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Nestled in the back of a quaint, little health food store, Beehive may just be the best place for vegetarian/vegan food in Miami.  And unlike many of the city's health food restaurants, it won't cost you half a pay check to eat here.  I've read a few reviews by people whining about how ""cluttered"" the place is, or even went so far as to call it filthy.  Well if you're a spoiled brat who doesn't understand the concept of limited space, then maybe you'd feel that way, but it's as clean as any other restaurant that cares about providing an excellent experience, and that they do.  Beehive's small size makes for some very intimate ambiance.  Customers and staff are constantly chatting back and forth, and everyone seems to know one another by first name.,The food is excellent, and there's always a nice variety to choose from.  I usually start with two options, for example, a broccoli/tofu pie with kale slaw, usually enough to hit the spot.  It's also not a bad idea to just opt for one main item, plus a side salad.  The salad portions are generous, and include avocado, sprouts, and shredded beets, not just your typical run-of-the-mill salad ingredients.  Try it with their homemade miso dressing, very pleasant and mild.  The desserts are exceptional.  I've always found vegan friendly desserts to be very hit or miss, but they seem to have it down.  Their cakes especially are usually superb, especially the blueberry. ,Just give it a shot, they don't have a ton of loyal patrons for nothing.  You'll leave feeling great."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/28/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Awesome little cafe for people of all tastes! I'm vegan and find this a rare gem in Miami..it's delicious, affordable, and healthy. Would definitely recommend."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/12/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,My absolute favorite place for healthy and affordable meals!! Both food and shakes exceed my expectations of vegan food!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/11/2015,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love this place! Everything is absolutely delicious. Everything they offer is vegan friendly and most things are gluten free ( they always let you know when something isn't.. Like barley soup!) Carlos is a super nice guy, always smiling and making people laugh. The rainforest smoothie is my personal favorite. The tres amigos with brown rice and vegetables is fantastic. Soy picadillo and seitan empanadas are great. They have a pretty big variety of healthy deserts, love the cookies, carrot cupcakes and chocolate cake. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the place always looks messy and not so clean. I am big on cleanliness, but the food is too good to stop going."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"this place is like the Cheers of hippies and fake-aterians alike.  The chef is a quirky Brazilian dude named Carlos that entertains his die hard fans with his Seitan Pie, Soy Chicharron and vegan Saltena which i might add taste closer to to a real saltena than most spots and it doesn't even have meat! whoa.,It is hard to get a seat during lunch since the business executive lunch people and the newly retired older folks on a health kick are busy yapping away and gawking at what eachother ordered.  It's cute, theres a sense of community when people in all walks of life are guzzling down shots of wheatgrass and passing around that papaya hot sauce Carlos makes. ,The Rainforest smoothie is a must try. been coming here since 2005 and won't stop."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/4/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. As a new vegan it's so hard to find food on the go. Not only can you get your natural herbal supplements,  vegan proteins,  and a ton of healthy goodies, there is a freaking mini restaurant in here. I had baked tofu which taste just like chicarron (fried pork). The owner is hilarious and let's you sample almost everything as long as you give a smile in return. HOT FOOD IS ONLY SERVED AFTER 1PM. A little downer but still worth it. I assume they cook first thing in the morning so everything is fresh!! But before 1 they still have killer juices and sandwiches."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This is hands down my favorite vegan/vegetarian/health food store/restaurants in the south Miami area. For the first time today I tried the Rainforest smoothie. That was amazing!!!! The ingredients sound very odd but it's simply delicious and very filling on its own: frozen bananas, avocado, apple juice, carrot juice, ginger, and lime (all natural and freshly squeezed). I also tried the spinach empanada from other yelper's reviews and it was simply outstanding!!! VERY good flavor. The squash soup was also very tasty and creamy with that perfect squash sweetness flavor. It's far from my work but it's my favorite lunchtime spot. PS- Gets full for lunch since there are only like 6 barstools at the counter. Best to take to go."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/1/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The Beehive has incredibly delicious and affordable homemade vegan food. The daily specials are fresh, healthy, and made with love. The smoothies are less than $5 and made with really good quality ingredients including fresh squeezed juices. Carlos is amazing! This place is truly one of a kind!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"If you are vegan it's right up your alley!! If you're not like me, then you'll be pleasantly surprised about how good the food is and you'll find yourself coming back again and again!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/10/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"yesterday was my first time here and I LOVED IT!! Health store with a juice bar is such a great idea. Everything looked very clean, fresh and welcoming. I had the mixed veggie juice and added cayenne pepper... juice was perfection!! i saw previous reviews about them using apple juice so I asked them about that and they said all the veggie juice use REAL apples. if it does have ""apple juice"" it does state it on the menu (usually only for the fruit smoothies) so they are not tricking you. the service in beehive was phenomenal and they will answer any questions you may have about there menu with no hesitation & everything in this location is truly organic and good for you. I also tried a pineapple cake that was gluten, dairy free & had low sugar so for a test, I took a piece home for me ( I have a milk allergy ) and for my diabetic mom to see if in the morning I would get a stomach ache and if her sugar would be high and guess what?!? I didn't get a stomach ache and my moms sugar was perfection. I also tried there vegan empanadas that were delish!! this place is perfect for anyone who watches what they eat and want top of the line vitamins. I have yet to check out the whole store because I was so into the food but I will be defiantly going back again and again and again !! they also have organic wine and beer that I will be buying next time I go to give that a try :) overall this place is a gem and I can't believe it took me this long to find it."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. I'm not even a vegan but I'm here twice a week at least for a good, fresh lunch that doesn't leave me ready to nap. Every dish and smoothie I've tried has been good, and the owner has great energy. It feels like a neighborhood hangout/cafe. Highly recommended!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/8/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Very Delicious place, they make it easy to be vegan with there great tasting meals. ,It is not the fanciest place in the world but they sure make up with it with great customer service and  healthy meals !"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/12/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here the other day with my non vegan friend. When we sat down they handed us samples of the soup. And before we left they also gave us a sample of a smoothie! Everything was delicious. We had the special which was tres amigos, with veggie rice and kale slaw. It was delicious. He kept saying how good the food was. We also tried the vegan and gluten free cupcakes! We shared the carrot cake one and chcolate one. They were sooo good. Neither of us are big fans of carrot cake but that cupcake was amazing! Ill definatly be coming back next time im in the area."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The best restaurant in Miami. Most of the dishes on the menu are vegan. There is an option of tuna salad. Everything they make is excellent. The juices and smoothies are incredible. The staff is very accommodating. Carlos, the chef and owner is great with a very positive energy. The atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming. They have a great variety of dishes every day. They offer kombucha and the best Acai bowl in Town. I have tried all the vegan restaurants in Miami and out of Miami. By far the Beehive is the best. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you Carlos for such an amazing gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/10/2012,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,"I occasionally try to eat vegetarian/vegan - in no way am I a sworn meat-eater. I'll eat veggie if it's interesting and tastes good. Sadly, we don't seem to have many options that qualify on the ""interesting"" front. Having clocked the positive Yelp reviews for Beehive, a place my parents used to hit up for vitamins in the 1980s, I was mildly excited to finally make it over to the Red-Bird Schenley Park area for lunch.,Upon arrival, I was informed that they didn't have anything, except for veggie sandwiches, and cheese sandwiches. Groan. Veggies are fine in a sandwich, densely layered upon something thick and meaty. But veggies, as the main event? Sigh. Kill me now. ,The sandwich was some lettuce, tomato, carrot and sprout affair on whole wheat bread. It tasted as dull as it sounds. Some vinaigrette was provided in a bottle, and that helped the sandwich out somewhat.,OK, it filled me up. Fine. But I knew that was fool's gold, and I'd be hungry again in 30 minutes. I noted a cake of some sort sitting on the counter, in one of those containers you'd have expected to see on an old-timey 1950s Woolworth's lunch counter. I inquired. It was some kind of vegan strawberry-blueberry cake. It saved the meal. With what tasted like cream cheese icing, this cake was actually quite good. It wasn't over-sweetened, and tasted like real strawberries and blueberries.,I'd go back for the baked goods, but to earn more stars from me - I'm gonna need more than a carrot-and-sprout sandwich."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/13/2016,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,Small parking lot. We tried the salteñas and the spinach empanadas. I highly recommend the vegan salteñas. We think the food could use more spice or offer a spicy salsa to go with the food.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/19/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It's hard to find a mom and pop organic spot in Miami. This place not only has fresh organic products, but the staff is super friendly as well! My boyfriend and I had a tuna salad, tuna sandwich, vegan coconut cake (which is to die for) two wheatgrass shots, and a kombucha drink all for $30! Definitely our new healthy go to spot!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/15/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I had the rainforest juice, eggplant, quinoa and veggies, and a carrot cake cupcake.  All fresh, all delicious, all vegan.  A+++"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/5/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here to help my grandmother find some herbal supplements for her arthritis and the owner was working the counter. He was super helpful and knowledgable and they had both herbs we were looking for (dragons claw and celery seed). Then of course, being a vegan, I walked around the aisles and found they had so many goodies. On top of that, the juice I had was delicious and I ended up buying 4 vegan empanadas to go. They were awesome needles to say, this spot is a hidden gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/19/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Every time I go to this juice bar, my experience is better than the last. The employees are always welcoming and will greet you with a smile. They are knowledgeable and will help you if you need any advice on what to get. There is also a store near the  juice bar containing natural foods and home remedies. If you need a suggestion to aid an ailment this is a pretty good spot if you rely on natural products. The food itself is phenomenal as far as vegan options go. They have a large selection and will cater to any requests. All around a great little spot."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/1/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"First time here and a non vegan and it's so good !,The atmosphere is nice and small. The owner is very welcoming and nice. ,I ordered the hummus sandwhich which was amazing ! And the raw cinnamon rolls as well. That was soooo good ! ,I highly recommend checking this place out!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/24/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,Love the vegan guava and cheese pastries and that you sell the spirutein protein powder packets. Nice vibe and I'll be back regularly!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/31/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The very first thing that greats you when you walk into Beehive, is that it's actually a market for natural and Vegan products and that on the left side is the actual bar.,Awaiting is the owner - whose name I did not get - with a big smile on his face and an immense aura of friendliness that almost makes you suspect the quality of the food.,Then when you order any number of different salads or the daily main entree, or any of the smoothies and juices, you quickly realize you are somewhere that respects quality and that respects food.,In it's simplicity, the menu offers fresh vegetables and impeccably constructed pastries. ,Throughout your lunch, the owner is very attentive to your needs and he will continuously be friendly.,Highly Recommended."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/19/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,For not being a vegan the  lunch specials are not only good but priced even better call ahead and place your order when you're on the way there's only a few guys behind the bar so it takes them a little while to get an order out especially if you're ordering a shot or a fresh juice which I highly recommend
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/24/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Beehive's new location still deserves five stars for delivering solid vegan and veggie eats in an area where they're not readily available. I remember being intimidated the first time I visited the small location but this spot is definitely more welcoming. ,The shop is now a lot bigger so there are a few tables away from the counter if you want to sit down and enjoy. The health market is also easier to peruse although I've never picked up anything myself. ,My go-to order is a Rainforest smoothie and a picadillo empanada with miso dipping sauce. It's deceivingly really filling so I rarely have room for a sweet treat, but when I do, it's always delicious. They have rotating daily specials and the owner Carlos will probably give you a sample of the soup of the day which is always tempting. Usually you'll find some sort of rice, beans, protein and veggies, making for the perfect plate at a decent price! ,The smoothie menu is now expanded and easier to read but I rarely venture from that Rainforest!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/27/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,This is definitely my favorite juice bar in miami! The prices are not high and you get amazing quality juices and food.

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/23/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"My all time favorite vegan spot and juice bar! I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian/vegan options are phenomenal.

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/14/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Nice vegan food and juices. The owner is always overseen everything. I liked the empanadas and Rain forest smoothie. You must visit this wonderful hidden gem.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/10/2018,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Praise for Beehive!! Don't let the facade fool you. It looks like just a store, but you can also get yummy vegetarian/vegan options made fresh for you in their little restaurant. ,I was in the area and looking for something ultra healthy and natural and found this spot. We tried two fruit smoothies one with vegetable protein and one without. Highly recommend! In addition, we got the soy picadillo empanadas and mushroom empanadas. Holy wow! I was so impressed with the flavor that I'm going tomorrow to take some back to Ny with me. ,We also took the green salad to go and a Fred Vega table sandwich in Ezekiel bread. The perfect lunch. ,Would love to go back and try more items and shop around."

I absolutely love everything that's there is to offer in this little gem. This is a vegan spot but delicious and cooked to perfection. Everyday they have a different menu with a soup of the day, doesn't matter what's on the menu because everything is delicious including there delicious homemade deserts mind you this is all still vegan that will blow your taste buds away. Prices are also great nothing expensive all reasonable prices for great healthy food. The owner by the way is great guy and makes you feel comfortable with great service at the little mini restaurant bar. Cheers!!!"

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/24/2017,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I always find that they have the best selection of vegan dishes freshly prepared every day. I am not vegan but I do enjoy the creativity put into making meatless dishes that taste fantastic and are beneficial to your health. ,Their juice bar is on point, no frills, just a juicer and the freshest fruits and veggies in whatever combo you prefer. They also have a menu with suggestions and they are very helpful in giving you suggestions depending on your health needs. ,I like that they carry a nice selection of herbs, powders, and other natural health related items. You can find anything from deodorant to tea, to salt lamps. ,Everyone is friendly and seems to recognize me even though I don't frequent regularly. ,The food and juices are reasonably priced and definitely made with love and care."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/12/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Living down south I try to make it as often as I can, and every single time I go Carlos is as welcoming as always. The food is probably one of the best in the Miami area and the vegan brownies are to die for! Within my personal favorites are the lentil soup, tres amigos and even the empanadas are delicious. Recommend 100%."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/24/2012,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Not only was the food excellent, their service was good too, which is hard to find in Miami.  We had the spring rolls, pad thai, and red curry.  We ordered everything vegetarian and our server asked if we were vegan.  While we are not vegan, it shows that the restaurant is willing to make adjustments and be vegan friendly.  Also, the entrees are big enough to share, so the food can be economical if you are willing to share food."
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",1/9/2014,$$,5,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"Fresh, made-to-order vegan/vegetarian/kosher-friendly food, and even friendlier people! I'm from New York City and can tell you this is far from the traditional Jewish deli. I wasn't in the mood for soup, but they make a new one from scratch every day, and the lentil one I sampled was delicious. If you're eating alone like I was, this is the best place to have a sit-down meal because everyone who works here is a total sweetheart.,They have an in-house sushi chef who makes a mean tempura vegetarian roll. If you don't believe vegans can enjoy sushi, think again! I also tried their meatless Schwarma special (listed under specialty sandwiches and includes your drink). Picture a soft pita corner stuffed with vegan steak, tahini, hummus and all the spicy dressings. Then double that image, and fill the rest of the plate with fresh, crispy shoestring fries, and you have the special. The two entrees were more than enough food for two people, but I took the other half the go.,My total came out to a measly $20 before tips, which is a steal considering I had enough food for 2 meals. I will however say that the tempura sushi loses the crispness after being in the fridge and fries don't take well to being microwaved, so do yourself a favor and eat it fresh!"

"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",10/29/2014,$$,4,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"I love this place. When I worked downtown, I used to go at least twice a month if not more. The food is excellent. Because it is a kosher restaurant, many of the dishes are vegetarian or vegan by default, which is perfect for me. What I like most about the restaurant, however, is how nice the owner is. He would always remember me and what I liked.  He was eager to recommend new dishes and let me try samples. It's hard to find restaurants in Miami where owners try to build relationships with their patrons, so it was a real treat to be a customer here."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",8/17/2017,$$,4,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"The food was great although for me, the vegan choices were very limited.  Their menu does list the vegan choices however and the vegan speciality they had, the only vegan entree, was fantastic.  A little expensive but not ridiculous and if you're a wine drinker, I'm not, it's probably 5 star as they have a lot of wines and even a wine tasting barrel."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",6/29/2017,$$,5,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"My first time going to Cooper's Hawk was an enjoyable one! I went for dinner last night 6.28.17 with a group of girlfriends and loved it so much, I've been raving about it to everyone since! I can't wait to return for happy hour! The restaurant is located in CityPlace, a new upscale entertainment shopping mall-like area in Doral. Our reservation was for 7:30pm, but we had a difficult time locating parking near the reataurant, so i recommend to go straight to the parking garage. I was there for 2hrs and parking was $4.00. The wait staff greeted us w a huge smile and immediately took us to our table. Sweet décor, with fancy and comfortable booths all over. Rachel, our server was exceptional, you can tell she has food service experience and is very well informed on both the food and wine menus..not to mention friendly, attentive and courteous. She immediately explained the concept of the restaurant and informed us of the complimentary wine samples for up to 3 different wines per person. She initially brought the Winemaker's Barrel Reserve to try...very generous pour and so delicious..it was a Bordeaux, then the Hawk Red end finally the Cabernet Sauvignon..We recieved a warm pretzel bread w a side of honey mustard..so yummy and soft..we had 2 of those. The menu is extensive and they cater to vegan/vegetarians, so i was pretty happy..i ordered for my entree, the Veggie Burger..oh sooo soo good! I veggie paddy is made from red quinoa, black beans and rolled oats..just wow and its huge too!! It comes w a side of fennel quinoa salad..one gal had the brussel sprouts appetizer, which were charred perfectly and had a delicious sesame sriracha aioli sauce on top and the portion was large. We were all satisfied w our foods! No complaints, just total raves! For desserts, we had a chocolate covered strawberries! Perfecr! Everyone was delighted with their food and overall experience. Will definitely be returning soon!"
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",2/11/2018,$$,4,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"A definite 4 and 1/2 star ranking.  I will go with a 4 here.  I came in here while on jury duty and was pleasantly surprised.  They have excellent vegan options.  There was a wide variety of items on the menu.  I ordered the falafel plate and it was delicious.  The service was fast and efficient.  The set up to order and pay is a little unconventional.  One of the servers was offering samples of the soup of the day when I was in. , There was plenty of seating and the decor was simple.  The restaurant was clean.  Holy Bagels and Pizzeria has an Israeli vibe going on.  I would certainly go back if I lived or worked in the area."
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",1/16/2018,$$,5,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,Amazing!! The best salad I have had in a while! The menu is spectacular. Loads of options. A wonderful selection of vegetarian and vegan options. First time trying soy chicken and I love it here. Will definitely be back!

"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/10/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Really fresh and tasty Thai food, the servers were so helpful and very polite and had a great knowledge of vegan food (suggested a substitute for the sauce with the spring rolls which was delicious) would definately visit or order out from here again if I'm in the area :)"
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",11/19/2011,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Happily another surprise gem in the Gables. I used to eat here when I was an omnivore who lived down the street. Now I'm a vegan who lives in South Beach, and without a car, it's rare that I get to the Gables. But when I'm there, I still want to eat (c'mon, I ALWAYS want to eat!).,I was asking questions about the menu (as we vegans are known to do) and the server actually said to me, ""You tell me you're vegan, I'll make your meal vegan."" That simple. He was knowledgeable and friendly and I had some delicious vegan spring rolls and a phenomenal veggie curry.,I'm always on the lookout for places I can eat with my non-vegan friends where we can ALL be happy. Lotus Garden is definitely a winner on that list."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/23/2018,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Love this place! The food is delicious, the portion just right and it's great value. There are vegan options. They offer take out. It's a winner! ,It's nice it's not a chain. The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is always relaxed and welcoming."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",10/12/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,Absolutely loved the food and service! We had green curry and the penang curry which were both phenomenal. They were also awesome in accommodating for a vegan diet.
"1547 SW 27th Ave, Miami, FL 33145",3/1/2018,$,5,El Palacio De Los Jugos,"My go to place for fast- home made style authentic Hispanic food. And guárapo that NEVER fails me ! What havent I tried from here... I wonder. Ive even had the sandwiches. The desserts, the fruits, the salads. I LOVE IT ALL. Never really had an issue and I usually share a $12 meal with 3 people and it's very filling. The people who work here are extremely sweet ladies. I'm so glad I just moved 2 minutes from here now I go walking there all the time for a passion fruit juice run. Did I mention... I'm vegan ! But I still love this place and the delicious vegan options they have that are not limited at all compared to other Spanish places where I'm stuck eating rice and beans."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,3,Yuzu,"Vegan Ramen review ... I really wanted to love this ramen but it was just an okay ramen for me. Broth was ok need a little bit more flavor to develop in the broth. The mushroom in the ramen was amazing!! the give you a lot of them . I feel as tho the fried garlic looks great on top but once they in the broth they get soaky and made it very greasy. The noodles was really good , perfectly cooked. This vegan ramen needs a little bit of love , maybe add some nori for more flavor , something pickle to cut the greasiness. The staff here was very nice. i'll be back to try some other dishes that they have."
