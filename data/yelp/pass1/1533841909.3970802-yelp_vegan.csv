"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/2/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"The food here is delicious. The cococurry panini is my favorite. They have vegetarian and vegan options, which is a plus. Downsides: seating is limited, it's a bit pricey, and there can be very long lines and waiting times for food. They open at noon on weekdays; if they opened at 11:30 it would add a lot of lunchtime flexibility for those who attend/work at FIU, this restaurant's primary clientele."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/20/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"this is one of my FAVORITE places to go eat!!! I'm always craving it! the environment is really cute and cozy :-) definitely order the Vegan Coco Curry Panini and the Arnoldo Palmer, you wooon't be disappointed!"
"4740 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/3/2014,$$,5,Shokudo,"Great atmosphere without all the pretentiousness going on a little south of there in the DD. Friendly waitstaff and super friendly owner. Yes, the owner was there and working to make sure everything was enjoyable. I love when I'm eating at an establishment where an owner cares enough to be around. The service was quick, but not pushy. Each and every dish was excellent. I'm not sure what the name of the dish was, but it was one of the few vegan options...something curried. We ended up eating two of them...I also had the ramen soup. SOLD! It was awesome. The egg was perfectly poached...I'll have to remember to write down what we eat next time. I hope that next time is very soon. Great place and glad to see it is doing so well."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",5/4/2013,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"Been coming to specialtea for a while now and it is great. Food and tea are fantastic and they have Sweetwater coffee! As a former Gainesvillian that keeps me perpetually excited. Great veggie and vegan options, great wraps and paninos, and great salads.,The service used to be slow but it seems like they have been working on that as the last few times I've been things have been great.,Updating my review:,I've been coming here for a couple years now and quality has progressively gone down while price has gone up and the menu has gotten smaller. Friendly, personal service that may have taken a little way has gone. Now you get faster service from people who don't care nearly as much and aren't as personable. It all makes me very sad."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",11/20/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"100% vegan friendly food, EXCELLENT service, delicious meals, amazing teas, great selection of baked goods, it doesn't get any better than this place. The atmosphere is great. The food is great. The prices are great. I wish I could go there every day."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/24/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is one of the few places in Miami you can find VEGAN desserts. Even more rare, they are delicious and affordable! Not only that, but the atmosphere here is amazing and the staff are extremely friendly. Top hangout spot for sure! Beats Starbucks any day"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",5/12/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Delicious! Beautiful on the inside. Had the coconut curry vegan style panini. 5 stars. Coming back. A subtly sweet and spicy taste.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/7/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"If you are looking for a chill place to have lunch by FIU or an early dinner, plus a bomb cup of coffee or tea, this is your place.  They have a wall of teas, vegan options, and the desserts are insanely decadent.,The food is AMAZING!!! Everything is made with organically, locally grown ingredients and lotsa love :)  Seriously, you haven't lived until you've had their Coco Curry Panini... chicken, cheese, bread, coconut dipping sauce... Who knew this was the perfect food marriage? , ,Every single person I have brought to this place falls in love with it and returns. The portions are big, the prices, comparably small to Starbucks. The food is always fresh. The eco-friendly restaurant is always clean. There are board games available for tables to play. Wifi is free for customers. ,It is owned by a couple, and they are always there working. The downside to this is the place is only open one shift. If they get sick, the restaurant does not open. They close Sundays. If they have an outta town weekend, SpecialTea is closed then too. This bothers some people quite a bit, but is easily remedied if you follow them on Facebook. They post their current hours (open and close later during the summer), days where they plan to be closed, and of course pictures of all their CRAZY-DELICIOUS baked goods. ,Go. ,Seriously."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/11/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I love love loooove SpecialTEA!  My question is why aren't there more places in Miami like this???  There is a huge selection of teas, ranging from green, white, black, oolong, rooibos, honeybush, mate, and fruit tisanes.  Along the wall by the cash counter you can smell each of the tea leaf mixtures in tin cans.  But they also specialize in coffees, with all kinds of expresso, lattes, cappuccinos.  I'm not as big of a coffee fan as I am of tea, but man, it's a choice selection!  But wait, there's more, they have their cafe menu, and while I haven't ventured as much in trying their delish paninis and wraps... I've had their Coco-curry vegan (yes, you can make it vegan) spinach wrap, with that mmm-so-good coconut sauce. Oh my!  You will be salivating for more!  (I'm guilty, I've had it at least 3x now) ,There is a bit of a wait every time we go in, but that is because the owner is there taking orders and tailoring each customer's specific requests.  It's worth the wait.  When I step into this place, I'm gonna want to take my time and lounge!  It ain't no grab-in-go Starbucks!  ,Then there is the ambiance.  It's a cute and cozy place, but can get filled up pretty quickly. Still, it's a great place to get away to study, or take a break from studying and play a board game (they have a ton of games!  deluxe scrabble anyone?) ... yes, with your new-found favorite vegan wrap coupled with the gunpowder temple of heaven green tea, or honey vanilla white tea, or frozen rooibos red expresso, or, or... the list is pretty endless.  Do try it, your taste buds will thank you for it."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/30/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"SpecialTea Lounge is a unique, hipsteresque tea house that truly caters to college students. They have the best salads, panini's, and wraps in all of Westchester. They also have a wide selection of teas to chose from, both hot and cold, to accompany your meal. Every day they make fresh pastries such as cookies and croissants. They are also vegan friendly! They are open until late, and just recently started opening on Saturday's. With free wifi, board games, and communal book shelf, it's easy to see why college students love this location so much. The only thing that I would have to warn you about is wait times and seating. Depending on the time of day you decide to go, you may experience long lines and a long wait due to short staff. Also, there is limited seating so you will have to take your meal to go or sit outside (which in this Miami heat is the last resort). Other than that, I have to say that the ambiance, food, drinks, and music will have you returning back!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/7/2015,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"We need more places like this more spread out across Miami. Great atmosphere with board games, books and Tv's oh, and free WiFi! Wide selection of teas to choose from and paninis, wraps and salads. My personal favorite is the coco curry, pesto and ay chihuahua. Is vegan and vegetarian friendly. Enjoy the desserts they display by the cashier, choose from different tea assortment accessories as well. The only thing I don't like is how expensive it has gotten. Before you could get a solid meal for $6-$7 now minimum is probably around $10 :( I think they should lower their prices a bit since it's so close to FIU for more broke college students to enjoy!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"In a sea of boring and cookie cutter coffee shops, is refreshing to have a local one where one can go to have a nice cup Joe. The salads are awesome.  The sandwiches are plentiful, and they cater to vegetarians and vegans! The only drawback is that if you eat there you will come out smelling like food.  So, I highly suggest for the management to increase their exhaust system, and maybe people will stick around a little longer."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/17/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Love this place! Conveniently located next to FIU, so this is quickly becoming my off-campus fave for a healthy lunch study session. Their teas are great, especially love their fruit infusions. The food is great too, lots of vegan options. You really can't beat their vegan cookies either."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/23/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Everything in this place, literally took me to a state of meaningfulness. Starting from the atmosphere, decor, seating arrangements, music selection, smells and  color schemes, as well as the amenities (book exchange, magazines, board games, guitar). To top it all off, the food is mouth watering, healthy and tasty. Not to mention the amazing varieties of coffees, teas, and vegan friendly baked goods that are to die for!! SpecialTEA Lounge is a loving piece of Heaven! The creator behind this idea of a lounge, totally outdid himself! 5 out 5 Star Rating."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/10/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Best chocolate chip vegan cookies on earth. Thus far. Paninis are delicious. I've also gotten a salad before and it was spectacular. ,The staff can be a little rude but the food and tea surpass the bitterness."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/14/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I was drawn to this place since the Yelp event the attended.  The vegan walnut brownies are AMAZING!  The curry chicken panini is also amazing.  That's my daughters favorite sandwich when she goes.  You can't go wrong with the desserts and sweets they have.  The chocolate chip cookies are just oh so yummy.  This is a cool spot for a college kid to hang out.  I know it makes my daughter excited about getting into college because of the vibe, food and music. Lol. I come from Homestead to this place every now and then or stop by if I take turnpike hm from wk.  The tea here is nice and refreshing but the strawberry-banana smoothie is AMAZING!  I purchased it for the baby to have a drink and when I took a sip I had to get a cup and ask the baby if she can share. Thank goodness she said yes lol. But as for my oldest she got a no lol. ,Great place for food and refreshing drinks and the salads and sandwiches are of a huge portion to me. Both my daughter and I can barely make it through a half piece of a panini. Well worth the money and stop."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/31/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"This place is great. Nice menu selection and variety of teas, smoothies, frappes, etc... It is a little on the more expensive side however you get what you pay for. It is high quality ingredients and it has some nice vegetarian and vegan options. Cute and quaint however you must have time when coming here because service can sometimes be a little slow and they are ALWAYS packed!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/19/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,This place is the titts! Vegan options and delicious I'll come here daily if I could :)
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/1/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Stop. I love. Omg. Can I type a proper sentence, please? The staff are SO friendly. There are board games to use. Books where you have to leave one in order to take one. And good menu options that can be made vegetarian or vegan. Place is small but cozy. Quaint for the university students to eat and do work or even get together to hang out. Have tea, some pastries - perfect place to go to for a meal or relax. I don't live around the area but I visit friends that do. I will definitely be going back -- can't wait"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/13/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I Love This Place! I'm so glad I Yelped! The sandwiches are great! Love the Variety! They offer Vegan friendly food too! Save room for the desserts, croissants and cookies! Yummy! It's more like a laid back lounge. The employees are very friendly and attentive! Definitely worth coming here!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",9/20/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Delicious smoothies and shakes! I tried the mango matcha shake with added boba.. amazing. Also, I love that this place has vegetarian and vegan options! I am a vegetarian so I appreciate this local rarity. The reason for the missing star is lack of space to sit and eat. People hangout for awhile for the free wifi. I took my order to go (coco curry wrap) and sadly it wound up soggy."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/11/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Tried out the Farmer's Harvest with the ¡Ay Chihuahua! tofu subsituting for the chicken and oh my goodness! The vinaigrette was sweet but not too sweet and it complimented the dried cranberries perfectly. Without a doubt a great vegan option! ,The Tropical Delight loose leaf tea was a perfect way to end the meal. Its almost like drinking warmed Hawiian Punched without rotting out all of your teeth. ,The vegan cookie was just like the ""real"" thing. Its the perfect soft cookie.,Love this place like crazy! Cant wait to try more teas!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/15/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Best place ever! I'm vegan and I was so happy to find this place near me, I go once a weekend probably! It is that good.  The Ay Chihuahua vegan in a panini is out of this world! Recomended"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/16/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,I finally made it here early in the day and their bakery case was stocked !  Yeah!  They had a vegan chocolate chip and matcha vegan chocolate chip cookies. I got them both... They were delicious .  You would never know they were vegan.  I got an almond croissant for a friend.  She gave it 5 stars.  I also ordered an iced coffee with almond milk.  Good strong coffee.  I am looking forward to coming back here again for lunch one day.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/17/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"The tea selection is good and the food is tasty, especially the vegan cookies. Love the take-a-book, leave-a-book idea, as simple as it may seem. The booths are comfy and the outlets work which is always a plus."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/3/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,This place is a hidden gem. The atmosphere is so welcoming and warm and so is the staff. Our cashier John Paul was very attentive and friendly. Our vegan cookies were better than any dairy cookie we've had and the boba is the best in the city. Definitely recommend.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2014,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"Menu has completely changed and very limited, more catered to the vegan side but still very limited.  You no longer have the option of picking an item and choosing how you want it.   The tea selection is now also limited.  Fortunately the selection of sandwiches they do have is still made good and delicious hence the 3 stars.  My favorite is still the coco curry, i am sad you cant switch up the chicken to steak or change to salad any more.  ,I will still return when im craving for sandwich but other then that im sad they limited their menu and tea selection hence why they are no longer really busy."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is the right place to go to when you want to treat yourself! It can get a little pricey but it's so worth it. As someone with dietary restrictions, their vegan menu is great! I normally go there to get a peach boba smoothie and some of their vegan desserts. Their chocolate chip cookies are out of this world, I could only dream of making something vegan taste that good! Also it's located nicely around FIU so I can swing by if I've had an extra long day. Love specialTEA!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/23/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Special Tea is a very easy place to fall in love with. It's a hidden gem - cozy ambience, every tea you could hope for, delicious coffee, and so many vegetarian options it's almost completely vegan. ,My favorite go to wrap is their ""ay Chihuahua"" selection... But unfortunately the wrap isn't the only thing saying ""ay"", my wallet is too. It pains me not giving them five stars but I just can't get myself to be okay with paying $9.50 for a wrap, no matter how delicious. ,They have free WiFi, a book selection, board games available, comfy couches and one of the best playlists I've heard always playing. ,Almost $20 for a wrap/salad/panini and some tea/coffee is worth it if you have the time to really just enjoy yourself and take advantage of the place. If you're looking for a quick bite don't come splurge here.,I usually treat myself after a test since its so close to FIU!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/7/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Absolutely love this place! The setting is so peaceful, the food is amazing, and the customer service is great. The mango boba slushy is my absolute favorite along with the vegan chocolate chip cookies. The pesto chicken is incredible. Definitely recommend coming here whether you're on the go or looking somewhere quiet to relax and get some work done."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/25/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"OMG I have lived just blocks away from this place forever and never gave it a try! As a brand new vegan, I decided to give them a try since they have so many vegan options! Let me tell you....paninis were amazing!! The vegan cookies are to die for... almost tasted just like the Subway cookies!! Not to mention, the staff is super friendly and helpful picking your food. The place has various tables ready and setup with chargers for the hardworking students and professionals. They also have a take one - leave one book shelf which is AMAZING!! I will definitely be coming again!!!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/22/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Absolute must if you are in the FIU area. I love this place! If you love tea in all shapes and sizes, this is the place to go. I always get the Arnaldo Palmer, which is made with the brew of the day so it always varies, lemonade and mint leaves. I also love the Ay Chihuahua! which is a wrap that has that Tex-mex feel. The good thing here is that everything is organic and very fresh. I've ordered this wrap like 10 times and it always tastes the same, which is a plus. Their Hunny Brisket is also really good. Even though the menu is not super long you can pick if you want the items to be in a panini, wrap or salad. Another thing they are amazing at is making VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. I know it sounds weird but seriously they are better than normal ones. Also, their vegan matcha chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING. ,Aside from all this, people come here to relax and study. I met with a group project there and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It is quiet, they have a TV with the news and also some sofas so people can get comfy. Definitely a hidden gem in the FIU area."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/6/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"What a great little spot! They have a big collection of teas, and they make an assortment of paninis and baked goods with plenty of vegan options. I got the double chocolate chip vegan cookie with the caramel coffee and it was delicious. It gets pretty crowded with people studying since it's right by fiu and they offer free wifi. But overall I highly recommend it."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/9/2015,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"I really do love this place. There's a tiny part of me that just wants to be there all day. But. The prices are crazy. A slush with boba is almost 6 dollars. But they are so delicious... They do offer one type vegan cookie a day, but once they run out that's about it. So I usually leave without my vegan cookies...,The employees are nice but are very slow. It usually takes a while before I start receiving parts of my order but it has always been correct. All in all it is a cute place with good food but be prepared to pay way too much for it. ,(Also their hours are weird and they should be open more.)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/19/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I have tried their paninis and wraps as well as a few drinks in their menu including hot chocolate and various bubble tea variations. I can vouch that the customer service is top notch and that they have many options including a plethora of vegan options. For any drink they always ask you what milk you would like. They have soy, almond, whole, skim, and coconut milk.  I'll occasionally get the cocounut milk, but the drinks themselves are good regardless of the dairy/non-dairy option you choose. They also have board games and books that you can use and a few booth seats. The location is a bit small, so if you bring a large group of people you may not find seats for everyone. They do have seats outside and two couches to sit on as well as some booths and tables inside. Their croissants are really unique and taste great. You can ask them to warm the croissants for you and they are made right there daily, so no fear of non fresh pastries. They also have free WiFi, a printer that you pay $0.14 per page to print at, and outlets where you can plug in your laptop or tablet if you need to. Great place to relax and study or just hang out with friends to play board games. I don't drink, but for those who like unique beers, they also have a large menu of alcoholic beverages. Really one of my favorite places to just relax."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/14/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This has to be my favorite place to study, hangout with friends and eat! It's a hip environment with an abundance of board games to play, books to read and teas to drink. I highly recommend everyone to come check it out especially if your vegan! This place has a lot of options for you plant based lovers"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",11/29/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This place is awesome and so are their vegan chocolate chip cookies, the environment is very welcoming and the staff is attentive. I wish they could be open at least a little bit longer on Saturday but it's cool that their open till Midnight on weekdays. Just know that the kitchen closes 11:30 PM if I'm not mistaken. So don't get there too late if you want a late night snack (that's healthy) ...I learned my lesson. :-) the window seats could be comfier but it's not too bad. Definitely worth the drive if you don't live around FIU though, so give it a go!!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/20/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Quaint and cozy, the atmosphere was calm and inviting. There was a great variety of Teas and vegan friendly sweeteners. The farm salad was fresh and delicious, filled with cashews, dried cranberries, mandarin slices, on a bed of spinach and kale, topped with seasoned chicken and and they have numerous of sauces to go with the salad. Besides the salads the other options are great fresh and vegan friendly. If your looking for a nice location to enjoy a good healthy meal this place is highly recommended."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/10/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Delicious food and the bakery is amazing can't believe the cookies are vegan so gooooooood.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/28/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Absolutely love this place! Best place to study and they even have beers! The food is delicious and the staff is awesome! P.S best vegan chocolate chip cookies ever!!!
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/7/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This place has a very casual and friendly ambiance. They have a great selection of healthy goods and they have vegan chocolate chip cookies. This place is a hidden gem. They have amazing choices for tea, coffee, beer and Boba drinks! Purchase anything and you will get free chips!  They even have a book shelf and board games for you to enjoy while youre indulging. Definitely will be back soon to try their variety of healthy wraps and vegan desserts."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/24/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Awesome lounge with lots of food to choose from including vegan options. I have enjoyed their paninis, organic teas and bubble tea. I noticed organic local coffee beans for sale as well. ,Chill music, lots of board games, books and wifi. Service is friendly, quick, and professional. Always a laid back atmosphere. ,I recommend coming here if you're bored and want to get out of the house.,They're open late too which is a plus."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/31/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I've been coming here for over a year and the employees already know me by name. It's a great place to study or to grab a bite and play a board game. Although I wish the place was bigger, they do have a couple of different areas to sit and even some tables outside. As for the food I've never been disappointed. I recommend getting the iced matcha latte with almond milk and the coco curry panino! Also don't leave before trying the matcha vegan cookies (best cookies ever!)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/13/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I found specialTEA while visiting Miami, and now that I'm back in Maryland I'm heartbroken that I can't eat their vegan cookies every day. They had 3 kinds on the day I went - chocolate chip, double chocolate, and green tea chocolate chip. That last one sounds crazy, but it was amazing (they all were). I'm kind of a connoisseur of baked goods :) and can honestly say these are some of the best cookies I've ever had. My two non-vegan sisters were really impressed by them too, and frankly their ""can I have a bite"" requests turned into eating a lot more than I'd hoped. :) ,We didn't stop there for long since we were on our way back from a day trip and were tired, so we got everything to go, but the atmosphere was really nice. The barista who helped me couldn't have been friendlier. And the boba tea (I had vanilla black tea with soy milk) was completely fantastic. ,Check them out!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/14/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Excellent food, drinks, service and ambience. Professional and friendly staff. They have a vegetarian and vegan friendly menu. It's a nice place to spend a few hours catching up with friends, reading a book, doing some work or simply to grab a quick bite. I like to go to this place to write my papers."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/27/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,My partner and I came here on a rainy day. I love the vibe of this place! It's a good location to hang out with friends or study. I love the vegan options (the Harvest salad was huge and so good!) and you can't leave without trying their cookies! I had one of each kind and they were all delicious. Service was good and the coffee hit the spot! My only complaint would be how small the place is.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/22/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I've been going here for 6 years and I've tried everything and it's honestly the best food and drink and chill spot in all of Miami. Especially if you are vegetarian or vegan. ,I am always there so I guess I'll see you soon, potential customer.,Try the Ay Chihuahua or the Coco Curry. I add bean salsa to everything. Have it with a matcha cookie and a cold brew.,Have that exact combination."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/26/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"As ridiculous as it may sound, if I ever had to choose a last meal, specialTeas's Ay Chihuahua wrap would be the first thing that would come to mind. Having attended FIU for four years, specialTea became an almost daily (and joyous) visit. From their multitudes of tea to their various vegan pastry options, this is by and large one of the best restaurants I've been to. It's a great place to eat, study/do work, and/or hangout.,If you do get a chance to visit you should try the ay chihauha wrap, the vegan chocolate chip cookies, and the arnold palmer ( their spin on the arnold palmer (they use their tea of the day + lemonade + mint leaves)).,If I am ever in the Tamiami area I make it a point to visit specialTea."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/2/2017,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Really cool atmosphere, good service. It can get pretty packed sometimes. Try the vegan cookies."

It's a good, chill place to get some homework done too. They have a bunch of tea options and if you go - have the oolong tea with a vegan chocolate chip cookie. So yummy!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/4/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,Nice little tea and food cafe. Seems to be very conscious of vegan and vegetarian diets. Food tastes good and they carry a variety of teas.

"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/6/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Cool, hip little coffee/tea shop right next to FIU. The employees were friendly and there's plenty of seating available. I ordered the olive panini which has fresh spinach, olive tapenade, & mozzarella. The portion is pretty big so I could only finish half and then I ordered a couple of the vegan cookies which were to DIE for!!!!!!!! My only constructive feedback would be that the floors were a bit dirty, a little upkeep and sweeping wouldn't hurt :) Aside from that, I'd definitely return for some more vegan baked goods and to try out some of their teas from their wide selection."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/2/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Amazing place! Favorite cafe in all of miami. It has good food, bubble tea, many vegan options, friendly vibes and awesome customer service."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/13/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is one of my favorite places to eat! I go to FIU and this is the kind of food place I would sacrifice my parking spot for! Luckily, now that they deliver I don't have to! I love their cookies!! ALL the cookies, the vegan and Matcha are my favorite though. The cookies and cream shake is so great too, especially since I can request it with almond milk. The Pesto Panini is my go-to meal. This is a much needed place near campus. They've expanded recently and have a printing station! Their workers are super helpful as well, they've often gone above and beyond whenever an issue arose. I also love that they have books and board games. The atmosphere is so great, they're environmentally friendly AND serve beer now. Definitely worth it!,Update: 3/6,I forgot to mention how incredibly amazing their online ordering ordering system is. It's intuitive, responsive, and delightfully detailed. The options allow you to truly customize your order and I love that you can pinpoint where you are on the map so that the delivery person knows exactly where to drop off your goodies. (This is incredibly helpful if you're on campus)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/2/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"AMAZING!! First, the greeting from the staff was extremely welcoming. I am so glad I visited this place. There were many options on the menu especially for vegans:) The service was quick and the food was delicious! The vegan cookies (cookies and cream for sure) are so good. I will definitely be going back. A+ loved it all."

"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/31/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I was first introduced to this place during my first week of school at FIU by a friend. On my first visit, I simple purchased chips and guac, with not much expectations. Wow was i surprised by the freshness and flavor of the guac and the chips were perfect, strong enough to hold the thickness of the guac. On my next visit, I tried the ay chihuahua wrap and it soon became my go-to wrap at this place. I love their fresh vegan cookies too! After your first visit, they give you a 20% discount for the next visit so you can't beat that. It's a good place to chill and study but you might want to get there early to get a table or a spot. Overall, specialTEA is pretty much that reliable hang-out spot you go to near school when you are just looking to be with your friends!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/10/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"So, I'm trying to eat healthy and started searching for healthy places near my fiancé and I...I came across this place on yelp (caught my attention instantly) with 4.5 stars and over 600 reviews. We decided to go for dinner and OH MY GOODNESS! De-li-cious! I had the ""Ay chihuahua"" in a garlic & herb wrap and my fiancé had the same but in a panini. We absolutely loved it!! We also tried their vegan cookies and you would never guess they are vegan. They're soft, chewy and super yummy! The location is in a shopping center near night owl cookies and it's a little hidden. Very small and cozy ambiance, they have tons of board games you can play, and since it's near FIU you'll see quite a few people with their laptops studying inside. However, there is seating outside as well. The staff is super friendly which is always a huge plus!...We will definitely be returning again soon"

The details, the attention, the food, the service.. I cannot express how grateful I feel for such a delightful experience. Im Vegan and there is great Vegan & Vegetarian options, my guests also had fish & meat & everybody loved the food. The drinks were delicious as well. Thank so much!

Only getting 3 stars because of the service. I ordered the vegan burger it was delicious not the best I've ever had. My wife ordered the chicken and waffles she loved them. I ordered the Mac and cheese but sent it back. If you're not into really cheesy mac, then its not for you"
"638 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",3/17/2013,$$,4,Bonding,"I used to come here when it was called Indochine and boy am I happy they changed owners and did a re-design.  Everyone was very satisfied with both Thai and Japanese dishes they ordered.  The owner even accommodated two vegan diners in our party with a special dish for them.  Also, for the quality of food, the price was perfect.  Its rare that you find a place that hits that trifecta of great food, great service, and great prices.  Highly recommended."
"8870 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2018,$,4,Mojo Donuts & Fried Chicken,"Great donuts! The coffee is pretty underwhelming, unfortunately, which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. The donuts I had were all really tasty. Not sure about vegan options since I went there worked to going vegan."
"2751 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2017,$$,3,SuViche - Wynwood,"This was my first time here, and I knew nothing about this place.  I was looking for seafood and found this close to where I was. We had sushi, ceviche, quinoa salad, ""Saltado veggie"" (great idea), and the ""Chaufa"" quinoa veggie (great idea).  I thought everything was decent, but not extraordinary.  It was takeout so sometimes that makes a difference.  I Loved the ""Saltado veggie"" it had the beef sauce and all that flavor without the beef.  The reason they are getting 3 stars is because while the ceviche seasoning was Good, the fish itself was a bit hard.  I don't know if it was over-""cooked"", old, or not fresh, so I was disappointed with this.  The service was Good because after I called to confirm the order, the server called me back to find-out if I was vegan, and said they could make the Saltado without the beef sauce, and the Chaufa without eggs."
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/28/2015,$$$,4,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"Went to Swine for lunch this past Thursday with a party of six. The first thing that stands out is the wonderful hickory smoke smell. My vegan and vegetarian co-workers were not the biggest fans, but it really adds to the flavor of the place. The ambience is awesome, very modern yet country. Several members of my party couldn't help but take pictures of the cool setup. I ordered the Ribs with Mac & Cheese, Grits, and Corn Bread. The Ribs were a little disappointing, but the sides were all amazing. I also got a chance to try out the Swine Burger, which was something I wish I had ordered. My vegan and vegetarian co-workers were all satisfied as well with a cauliflower and apple soup and the large variety of salads. The real problem we ran into was the service or lack of. It was a workday and we expressed our urgency, but our server kept disappearing and we ended up at the restaurant much longer than we would have wanted. So do not come expecting a quick meal, but if you have time to kill the food is well worth it."
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/22/2013,$$$,5,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"Prepare to do battle against the Vegans!,Best BBQ meal I've  had in a long while. ,We sampled almost everything here. You really cant go wrong. ,Even if you don't go for appetizers, just get the burnt ends anyway. You'll thank me later. Bone marrow wasnt very  notable. For entree's the stand outs were the ribs, and the brisket. Mind blowingly good!,The mac and cheese is great but almost too cheesy. ,Desserts are okay, you aren't mising anything too special if you have no room left or if you are"
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/21/2015,$$$,4,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"BEST OLD FASHIONEDS EVER! The food is good too. You need to be in the mood for a meat feast as there are few Vegetarian or Vegan options. However, the food is prepared well and good quality. Fun for groups of friends  & date night as well."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Great tacos great atmosphere. Went here during art walk late one night and was so surprised. I got the carne asada tacos and they were exactly what I wanted them to be. Real authentic Mexican tacos. Not that Tex mex junk. A little wedge of lime and some salsa verde and my life was made. I also got a side of guac and chips =amazing. Kinda weird tho bc if you order guac it doesn't come with chips, they're separate. But whatever. They chips were fresh and maybe the best I've had. I was concerned bc my friend is a vegan and I was expecting them to not have a vegan option but they did (I think it was cactus and quinoa) which she said were good. I was veryyyy full and very happy."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,5,Coyo Taco,"At least a couple good vegetarian/vegan options. Very good guac. I assume they use California Hass avocados instead of gross watery Florida ones, but I could be wrong about that."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/19/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,Best tacos in Wynwood. Comes two per order and wide variety to choose from. For the meat lovers as well as the vegans and pescatarians. Cold brews and a good selection of fresh made sauces to customize your taco.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2015,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Came here after a moto ride down to mia and they guys didn't seem to fond of the place but I thought it was pretty good. Guys are super picky anyways. Being a vegan, I ordered the nopales without cheese or sauce and it must have been too difficult to not put cheese on it. I had to send it back to the kitchen and they took some of the cheese off and gave it back to me. Things NOT to do to a vegan. I ended up eating around it because I'm not that much of a bitch. I also ordered a side of black beans (which were refried). Overall I thought the tacos were really good and I'm never gonna live down the heat of ordering a cactus taco LOLZ"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,Coyo Taco,Loved this place! The food was great...freshly prepared and fast. I loved the vibe and they had a dj and the music was awesome and eclectic.  It was vegan friendly which was a huge plus. The line was long but they moved fast and it was worth the wait. Definitely a cool spot to grab some good food and drinks that's super casual. I'm a pretty picky eater and I enjoyed this place.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/7/2017,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"NOM NOM NOM. so freaking tasty. Food is fresh, amazing quality, options for vegans/vegetarians and great vibe too. Love the outdoor seating. I am giving this place stars because I think for a place with such amazing tacos, they could def make some better guac! Margs are great here too. Never would have thought that a mushroom taco would taste so out of this world! Other than that, keep it up Coyo!"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"I had dinner here a few weeks ago, before exploring art walk and the galleries. And by dinner I mean, I nibbled on some tortilla chips with salsa. Lol. It's not the best place to go if you're vegan, but I realize that it's not a restaurant that is focused on that...but right next door there is a vegan friendly cafe! So keep that in mind if that's what you're craving. ,Anyway, Coyo Taco is okay butttt I really wish they had offered more veggie tacos. They didn't have a lot of options, even for vegetarians (from what I saw, but perhaps I am too picky), and the place just didn't seem to do it for me. Something about their tacos seemed unappetizing. Their prices were decent enough, and the location is great (who doesn't love Wynwood?), but if you're looking to eat tacos, there are other places to enjoy a meal in Miami which are much more aesthetically pleasing, committed to all dietary needs, spacious, and just more fun overall. We were barely able to find seats because the restaurant was overcrowded (and it was earlier in the night, too). I suppose it is meant to be an in and out food joint, and not really a place to lounge and enjoy the night."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/3/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"This place is always busy and it's definitely because of their food and their club room behind their restaurant. However, they don't have a huge array of options and I wouldn't consider their service to be that great either. The lady who was serving me clearly knew I was vegan and she deliberately added cheese to the mushroom tacos I had ordered. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered the mushroom tacos since I'm not particularly a fan of them but I did manage to get a bite or two in before losing my appetite and switching over to their guacamole and chips. ,I honestly think when I come back to this area since my boyfriend likes this place and knows it's cheap in comparison to other restaurants, I'll either eat prior to coming or just order a portion of their guac and chips. They were absolutely delicious but the main reason I'm giving this place three stars is because their customer service really lacks and are quite rude. Also because they haven't bothered to try and add more seating which always means that a lot of people end up standing up while eating."

You start off with choosing your base (salad, bowl, or pita) then you choose your meat, then you choose all the toppings and sauces. One thing i love about this place is that the vegetable options change depending on the season. Vegan and vegetarian options too!"

I ask them to bake the falafels for me instead of fry them and they do it every time. I get half and half of the bulgur and spring mix, regular and red hummus, baked falafel, olives, pickled cabbage, lettuce, tabouli, and the a tomato cucumber mix they have. I switch it up with the dressings, they're all vegan and delicious!"

"1252 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",1/29/2016,$$,4,Neme Gastro Bar,"I had seen this place being opened next to Doggis and couldn't wait to try it out! We went one Friday night at around 10:30. We did have to have a few minutes because the place was quite full. They have live Jazz on Fridays and Saturdays which is great! The owner greeted us and was very attentive. But it was so full that everyone was running around. Our waiter was very nice but he kept coming back to ask usto repeat what we had ordered because he had forgotten. The owner gave us two drinks of our choice due to the wait, which was awesome though! Very nice of him. The menu though is quite limited, and it was very different. The food options are very different. For example, we had the Vegan chicharron, the PBJ friend chicken (Like chicken and waffles, but chocolate waffles with PB) and I also had the pork belly. I'm not sure if it was the mix of items all together that I didn't like. I think it was a little too much on the experimental side. Not exactly my cup of tea. The drinks though, were delicious. My favorite was called ""The Note"". It has guava which made it incredibly amazing. I would go just for drinks and music next time. It has a nice vibe. I do think they need to put speakers towards the entrance of the restaurant where we were sitting because we couldn't hear too well what the person was singing. I know they just opened and they're still getting everything together, but I definitely would like to go back just for drinks with some friends. It's a great late night place to go to."
"1252 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",1/17/2016,$$,5,Neme Gastro Bar,"After reading Cassie G's pick of the month featuring Peanut butter fried chicken with grape jelly, maduro walffle, and maple-aji my interest was definitely peaked and I quickly bookmarked.  This new gastro bar has a great vibe and a compilation of great jazz music.  All of the dishes offered are unique and creative.  The vegan chicharron is offered as a complimentary dish for starters.  The chicharron is sprinkled with a spiced coffee rub, cilantro and lime.  Wow, the chicharron melts in your mouth and the spice combination is unique.  ,Dishes ordered:,Tostones con Avocado:  I almost didn't want to order since this dish is offered in so many other places, but I am glad I ordered. The texture of the plantain was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the center.  The avocado had a great combination of flavors, citrus and cilantro, just perfect.,Belly L.T. Featured Pork Belly from Miami Smokers served on top of greens, grainy mustard, rock shrimp and croutons.  Also very good,PB & J A version of chicken and waffles both sweet and savory.  This dish is very creative, the chicken was moist and the waffles had a very unique savory taste.  All of the components of the dish held it's own.  Even though I loved this dish I couldn't taste the peanut butter and the jelly tasted more like tamarind than grape jelly.  That being said the dish is still phenomenal.,Peanut Butter Ice Cream with Maduros:,I can definitely taste the peanut butter in the ice cream.  The combination of the saltiness of the peanut butter and the sweetness of the maduros worked.  There was a subtle syrup, but I am not sure what is was.  I also liked this dish.  ,The unique and creative dishes served at Neme Gastro Bar, combined with the nice décor, ambiance and great jazz music is deserving of a five star experience.  Can't wait to come back to try the other dishes offered."

I have to say, this place has become my favorite go-to restaurant in Miami. Every time I have friends in town we stop by for delicious cocktails (especially the Chinese holiday), the addictive vegan pork rind appetizers, fresh vegetable dishes, and unique entrees. I find the entrees somewhat pricy, but definitely worth it if that's what you want. The staff is very accommodating and always lets my fiance know what is or can be made gluten free (she has celiac disease)."

It brings a new dimension to the Miami River and makes us hopeful for its future. The atmosphere is very nice. My wife said she felt she was in St Tropez. The service was good, and the food is ok. I ordered the sea bass (I cheated from my wanna-be-vegan diet).  The plate came a la carte which at $41 is a bit disappointing. The sauce was a bit too salty for my tastes. The $8 grilled vegetables were good. I would go back to take visitors or clients, but it wasn't good enough for me to go back for the food. My wife agrees."

Our waitress, Annabel, was very attentive and was very respectful towards my group of friends because we do not eat any animal products ! She gave us a couple of options and catered to our needs. She went as far as to veganize a soup that  usually has  meat in it ! It was extremely delicious. To conclude, my friends and i ordered the avocado roll, a veggie roll, and a tofu kimchi soup! All were so amazingg !!! I'd come here again and again !"
"3194 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",2/25/2017,$$,5,Atchana’s Homegrown Thai,"You can never go wrong with Thai food, especially at Atchana's. The restaurant was packed like a can of sardines when we got there, but luckily we got outside seating immediately. The vegetable spring rolls are amazing to start off with, but I would almost save my appetite for the main course. Being my first visit, I just had to order me some pad thai. I didn't want any meat with it, but luckily they were able to substitute with tofu as my protein. Since they have all fresh ingredients and make everything themselves, they are actually able to accommodate a wide variety of diets from food allergies, vegetarians, vegans, etcetera etcetera. The tofu pad thai was delicious and filling - I had enough to fill me for that night and as leftovers the next day.   To finish off my meal, I ordered the thai donuts. It tasted a little different then I am used to. It is more like glazed donut bites with coconut, fudge and chocolate chips on the side. I am used to the donuts being completely drenched in the condensed milk. I have very high expectations for service at restaurants, and Atchana's exceeds it. Our waiter was Bret, who was more then helpful. Aside from him, other staff members would come ask us how our meals were and just talk to us. I really hope this restaurant suceeds in the Grove, with it's great food and staff."

Then napoletana has no cheese , just skip the anchovies .  The verdura miste is oven roasted veggies with focaccia bread is vegan as long as you skip the goat cheese on the focaccia and skip the yogurt sauce.  I had this and although it was a full plate , it didn't leave me feeling full.  It would have been nice with a side of pasta or some other grain.  My coworkers ordered pizza and calzones and they were fairly happy with their plates.  Maybe when I go back for happy hour I will be able to give 4 stars :)"

Everything we ate was seasoned perfectly and very very flavorful. Try the mjaddarah as an appetizer. Really special treat! If you are a vegetarian or vegan, they have so many great options.

Highly recommended it to anyone who likes middle eastern cuisine, or anyone looking for great food in Miami."

There was a large variety including vegan options. We tried a bit of everything. They even offer dessert. Everything was hot, delicious and filling.  We loved the mango lassi."

"295 NW 82nd Ave, Miami, FL 33126",5/18/2018,$$,5,Ashoka Indian Cuisine,"Today we went here for the first time. I was undecided on what to eat, and as a vegan I don't usually have many options. I decided to look at what was around us, and this gem popped up. ,I Love love loooove this place!!!,The samosas were absolutely delicious. So flaky, crispy, spicy. ,the Rocket Naan super spicy but I could still not put it down. ,For my entree I ordered the Chikka Masala it was perfectly balanced, buttery, fragrant, and beautifully plated.,The basmati rice cooked to perfection.,My husband ordered the Lamb Malabar, I hear it was delicious.,For dessert I took one server's suggestion and ordered Kufi.,It is the best coconut homemade ice cream I have ever had. I wish I would have had space for more food.,The servings are generous. The service is great. The place is beautiful. The pricing is fair. It is clean, and comfortable.,We will definitely go back many more times!!"
"10200 NW 25th St, Doral, FL 33172",2/14/2018,$$,5,Bocas House- Doral,"I ordered this short ribs and fried yucc and substituted grilled veggies for the  sausage at no additional cost. this dish cost $35 but I was not prepared for the quantity. omg it was very plentiful both the ribs and the yucca.and delicious too. my sister is both vegan and has celiac disease so she can't eat gluten. she ordered the veggie rice, the restaurant was very accommodating. well worth the visit."
"10200 NW 25th St, Doral, FL 33172",5/20/2018,$$,5,Bocas House- Doral,"It's late, I'm tired from driving and Bacas has a full house. So I decided grab something to go. I have no idea what this dish is called but I do know it's Falafel and Quinoa. I must say for a simple dish it's absolutely delicious. They have limited options for vegans, I'm grateful I came here and able to order food. ,Atmosphere is the best, people enjoying themselves with others. Staff isn't chaotic, very confident crew. Ohh, very clean, organized and lots of smiles. Very very friendly hostess. This how Culture should be. Two thumbs up on every level."
"Miami International Airport, Miami, FL 33166",2/27/2016,$$,5,Corona Beach House,"I am not your typical customer at a restaurant like this. I might be seen as a pain in the butt to most servers. I'm vegan and gluten free, so I'll start with that. I'm in an airport, so I don't have many options. This is a burger and taco joint. Giovanni, my server was superb and I'm not one to write reviews, but I felt he really deserved to be lauded for his attitude and obviously solid work ethic. Excellent experience. On a side note, Oscar, the manager was hustling around, wiping tables and asking customers if everything was to their liking. I'm telling you, if we had more guys like these in all jobs, we would be so much better off. I hope whoever hired these guys keeps their eyes on them and offers them the first opportunity for advancement! I know this must sound like I know these guys, but I just want to let them know how much their service is appreciated. Great experience at a restaurant in an airport, no less!!! Thanks guys. As Ali G would say: ""Much respect!!"""
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/13/2017,$$,4,Mister 01- Brickell,"Nice brick oven pizza and very vegan friendly. I had vegan cheese with tomato, pineapple, mushrooms and basil. It was very satisfying and the perfect size for me! Ate the whole thing"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/15/2017,$$,4,Mister 01- Brickell,"Very good, thin, tasty pizza! Fast and friendly service. Did not like the plastic cups for the water too much, nor the foam cups for the really very delicious cappuccino. Would like to find salt, paper and some condiments on the table. the vegan options for pizzas and calzones!! Definitely will be back to eat there. Good price for value, good quality food - you can taste the real tomatoes !"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/26/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,Still my favorite pizza place! I love the Vegan Riccardo!! Very glad for the vegan options and I love that it's not bland. So full of flavor
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/15/2017,$$,3,Mister 01- Brickell,"I've heard many people say this is the best pizza in Brickell, but I got a vegan style, traditional Riccardo pizza and wasn't impressed. The ""cheese"" was pretty tasteless and the pizza in general lacked flavor. Also, my crust was burnt but not the tasty crisp kind, I looked around and everyone's crust looked delicious so I must've just had bad luck. I will try again though, but order a vegan calzone next time!"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/5/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,"This place was the bomb! Vegan pizza on point! Yassss Queens, slay that pizza game!"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/20/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,"Loved their pizza, specially the pinneaple and mushroom one. Can't wait to try the vegan ones."
"9971 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",2/29/2016,$,4,The Habit Burger Grill,"The customer service was great, the cashier was very informative about how my food was prepared, acknowledging my vegan preferences. The food was ok to good. Could be made a little better. It did fall apart a little, but that's what I get for ordering it to go. Nice scenery as they try to give it a very LA beach kind of vibe. Not being a picky eater or customer, I was overall satisfied. Can't give a final judgment on this restaurant, considering I only tried it once. Would go back here to try other foods."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/22/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This market has something from everyone plus a fun atmosphere! From sushi to italian to a delicious vegan bakery, St. Roch Market is the next big Food Hall in Miami. Located in the upscale Design District, this market has a center bar, lot's of seating, and 10 food vendors to choose from. You order you food, find a place to seat, and pick up your food when you recieve a text letting you know it is ready. The staff are all wonderful and will help you decide on what to get to eat. I recommend ending your meal over at Chef Chloe & The Vegan Cafe for an amazing treat. Their cookies, cakes, and more taste delcious and are the perfect dessert."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,So great! So many options. You can eat food from all over the world all at once. Very cool vibe and very nice people. Plus the Chloe vegan bakery is amazing. About time we got one in miami.
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/18/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Great new spot, lots of options. Try the authentic homemade pasta made on the spot, or the vegan options at Cleo - the cashew butternut cream nachos were amazing!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/25/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,Food was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly.  Amazing butternut squash soup - vegan!
"4141 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2014,$$$,5,MC Kitchen,"Depending on who you ask, many people would say that MC Kitchen is either the best or second best ""foodie"" restaurant in all of Miami, which means you will need a reservation even if the dining room doesn't look full. You don't come to a place like this only to miss out by being vegan, but it's vegetarian-friendly if you eat cheese.,We split 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 side dish between 2 people. We started with the Cobia Crudo which was flavorful but not very much food, and a dish we honestly could have done without. If you want something more substantial, the Black Mission Fig Pizetta was amazing, and can be made vegetarian by asking them to leave out the prosciutto.,The kale risotto came alongside the entree and was good, but paled in comparison to the real star of the meal, the Roasted Pear and Cheese Fiocchi. It's hard to describe how these delicate pockets of pasta and stuffing just satisfies down to the soul! It's creamy but thick, sweet but savory, solid but melts in your mouth, yet somehow still greater than the sum of all it's adjectives! Their truffles are imported from Italy, and the taste was very evident in the Fiocchi.,Because our meal had no meat to pair with wine, we asked the waiter to recommend a nice dessert wine and he supplied an irresistibly sweet but deceptively strong $60 Barefoot Moscato, which put the cherry (or grape) on top of a truly amazing meal."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2016,$$,3,Organic Bites,"Nice, small little restaurant on Biscayne, nice little patio area too, great vegan choices I had the quinoa and black bean salad, butternut squash soup and stuffed mushrooms. My girlfriend isn't vegan but she just wanted to have dinner and a few beers, only disappointment was when we arrived here they said they weren't allowed to sell us beer for some weird reason (we are well over 21), I ate my food for the sake of not getting up and leaving but I really picked this place over Choices down the street because they said they had beer, they gave me a cheap glass of white wine for the inconvenience but come on that's not the same as a good craft beer. Might try them again if they get their bar situation figured out."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/21/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"Awesome service, friendly staff, great food and vegan options. I LOVE their veggie burger! Very nice atmosphere as well."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/31/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"Visiting from Toronto with my vegan friend - we are both very health conscious foodies. This spot was a GREAT find! I prefer to eat organically/responsibly raised meat and OBites certainly delivered. The chicken was so fresh and juicy, we couldn't get enough so went back the next day for lunch! I had a rare burger and my friend had the veggie burger both times.,We also shared the burrata (mouth watering) and zucchini carpaccio. The juices are made in house and had great zing. Would love a place like this back home and will definitely be back next time!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/15/2015,$$,5,Organic Bites,"I work in the area so I have seen this location as several restaurants since the Metro days. Finally we have something that's just as good as Metro! As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see many vegetarian and vegan options, and they are delicious! The green seed salad is light on the dressing as it stays true to the flavor of fresh Ingredients. The Veggie Carpaccio was also a nice treat as I had never seen that before. Definitely a nice fresh appetizer perfect for our hit Miami weather. The owner/manager I dealt with was delightful which was a nice change from many other places in the area of this type. I'm really looking forward to coming here before work,To try their juices and coffees in the future!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/22/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"I live close by and had a friend in town visiting. We wanted something healthy and with some vegan options for me. We decided to try Organic Bites and we were pleasantly surprised. ,Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some suggestions. She was a fun girl with a great spirit. I had the squash soup and the zucchini pasta, both of which were amazing. My friend had the chicken entrée with quinoa and scarfed it down!,The portion are perfect. We got the açai pudding for dessert and it was amazing as well. ,I will definitely come back as the atmosphere had a cool vibe and the staff was fun."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/9/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,I have been here twice and both times food was delicious and the service was excellent. On my first visit I had the the steak with a side of seeet potatoe fries and vegan capraccio and it all tasted great. This time around I ordered the signature burger with no bun and it was mouth watering. The point of the review is that you can't really go wrong with anything you devide to order. I hope as the word spreads and they get busier they can remain consistent with food quality and service.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/4/2016,$$,4,Organic Bites,"Ordered out for a staff lunch and we were all very impressed. Suggested by a vegan coworker, this place had more options than one would assume. I had the Reuben and added grilled onions. By far one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The atmosphere of this place is definitely a weekend favorite. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would for sure recommend this place to anyone looking for some different good eats."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/10/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,Burger was good and the ambiance was chill mainly outside. I did hate the fact there's no regular fries just sweet potato fries which I don't like. I know I'm prolly the only person earth that doesn't eat sweet potato fries but I just cannot get into them. Besides that there's nothing special about this place. Supposedly it serves organic foods. It is a great place for vegans because my friends bean vegan burger tasted actually better than my beef burger.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/23/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,"I heard about this place from a good friend of mine. She mentioned that the food was amazing. With much anticipation I visited the restaurant, it was cute and all however, there weren't many protein alternative options for vegans like myself.  They did have a vvegan burger which came with goat cheese so that wasn't very helpful. The service was aaaaaah just ok. A bit of a wait, yet there weren't many people in the restaurant. I asked for a macha tea with almond milk and I got just that a tall cup of warm milk with a teabag floating in it. That part still makes me giggle when I think of it. Long story short. I won't be putting this place on my list is frequently visited restaurants"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/22/2018,$$,5,Organic Bites,"This place is really good and everything on the menu looks awesome! What we did try was amazing! Everything tastes fresh, and the service is excellent. (They don't have many gluten free options which is a bummer, and not too many vegan options either.) Hopefully they get some Kombucha because that would be nice with the meal (instead of lemonade or soda) I would come back again to try more dishes and I would definitely recommend for a nice breakfast or lunch!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/12/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,Love the variety of food here. Many vegan options. You definitely need to pop over to Chef Chloe for the best ending to your meal. I love that the food hall has a vegan option at almost every vendor. It's awesome to be able to grab a delicious refreshing smoothie and head out to the terrace for a nice swing. Enjoy!
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I really love the concept of this higher end food court with healthy varieties! There's Italian, different types of Asian foods, vegan foods, smoothies and bowls, and a coffee bar just to name a few. I ordered the Ramen and honestly...not good. Avoid that. Bland and way overpriced for what it tasted like. BUT try the Avocado Salad from Chloe's and you'll LOVE it. There's a bar at the center for cocktails and wine and you can get drinks from the different markets. Definitely go with friends, grab drinks, and enjoy!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Really good has about 12 vendors of food . Tacos , vegan cafe ( which was amazing) and Asian food . The have char grilled oysters at another place . My favorite was the vegan cafe (the vegan nachos are amazing ) as wells as the large delicious guacamole salad . Def a must try"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This is an open market with many small food vendors and a bar in the middle. This spot was an awesome experience with friendly chefs rolling fresh pasta, excellent vegan desserts, and yummy cocktails made by friendly bartenders. I would definitely recommend stopping here for a bite while shopping in the awesome boutiques in the area."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I'm so glad more food halls are opening in Miami! St. Roch Market (apparently pronounced ""Rock"") is a great addition to Miami's growing roster of food halls. I checked it out this morning after learning about it on Chef Chloe Coscarelli's instagram, where she announced that she will have her own all-vegan stall in the market. , ,The place definitely fits within the Design District. It's a clean open space above Estefan Kitchen with a range of stalls - from asian and italian to coffee and smoothies. , ,I tried a basic açaí bowl from SweetBlendz and was a bit disappointed when I saw that the açaí puree was pre-made - but that quickly changed once I tried a bite and realized how yummy the puree actually is. I'd definitely recommend getting a bowl. It's topped with all kinds of fruit and is a decent size to fill you up. , ,One caveat to the whole place - everything's pretty pricey. My açaí bowl was about $12. A quick browse of the rest of the shops showed similarly high prices. I'll have to try more to see if the prices are worth it! Definitely looking forward to testing Chef Chloe's vegan goodies!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Excellent new spot in the Miami Design District with great options for a variety of cravings. Tacos? Chicken rice? Vegan cupcakes and matcha soft serve? You got it! Also, working on a random day and having some coffee to enjoy the ambiance is a great idea at St. Roch Market. ,Highly recommend the hummus from Jaffa, the peanut butter cookie from Chloe and the coffee from Sabal, of course!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/28/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Came over to St. Roch Market last night with a friend for dinner. I was instantly impressed with the decor and the variety of options it had to offer. From Meditteranean, Italian, Mexican, Vegan and more--with so many options it was hard to choose!,I ended up grabbing some tacos with my friend at the station called Hot Lime. I tried the short rib taco and the pork taco ($10 for two tacos or $14 for three). Absolutely delicious and satisfying! The guac ($9) we ordered as a side was made fresh but I personally didn't feel like the price tag matched the taste. Still good and would definitely recommend trying Hot Lime out.,We later had vegan dessert at Chole which was absolutely delicious! Whatever you do, please order the Strawberry Chocolate Cupcake. Soooo good! It may be vegan but it tastes just like chocolate. Could've fooled me.,On to the service at St. Roch Market...,The only reason I deducted one star was that of the service employees. My friend and I arrive around 7:45 PM on a Tuesday evening, it was not busy whatsoever. However, the bussers kept hovering over us to clean up our plates. We were asked SIX times (in a span of 15-20 mins) if they could remove our plates (which we were nowhere near done) simply because we were talking and enjoying our conversation. We finally gave up and left because of the pushy bussers. Honestly, this was my main complaint. No one wants to be rushed during dinner.,Overall, minus the pushy and annoying bussers, I'd come back to grab a bite soon!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"My crew (my wifey and sister-in-law) and I decided to try the new St. Roch Market in the Miami Design District. It's been open for about a month and it's a nice addition to the district. Its on the second floor of the shopping area and parking is very easy. There's valet or a self park garage. Let me tell you a little about the layout -- it's a food hall. There's about 10 food stands and they all have menus to pick from. There's seafood, chicken and waffles at a stand called ""Coop"". Ramen noodle soup at ""yuzu"". tacos  , chips and fresh made guacamole at ""hot lime"".  There also vegan  options in almost every stand. One of the details I did notice was that the staff working the tables and cleaning were very nice and doing an excellent job keeping the area clean. That's always a plus and The prices were reasonable. ,St. Roch Market is a nice addition to the Miami Design District. I recommend you try it for a afternoon or dinner."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/29/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Okay Eat! By Chloe is the best thing to happen to Miami! I love Vegan food and vegan options and this place has everything you want, but better! I tried the sprinkle cupcake and it tastes like heaven with sprinkles on it! Chocolatey deliciousness! Then the vegan nachos were AMAZING! I'd definitely share next time but also probably not because I ate all of them anyway! They were sweet but also salty and the toppings were perfect. Then the dragonfruit drink was so sour and sweet and perfect for a hot summer day. I wish I can eat here everyday ... maybe I will."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Great little food hall with lots of vegan options!!! My boyfriend and I got the spicy tofu banh mi sandwich  at Tran An and the vegan ramen at Yuzu. The sandwich was pretty good (pretty small for the price) but the ramen was to DIE FOR. ,It had tons of wonderful veggies and mushrooms, lots of flavor, and was a huge portion! Pro tip: ask them to split one order into two bowls for you. It's great to share! It was by far the best vegan ramen I've ever had. ,We would've gotten some desserts at Chef Chloe's place but it was late and they had sold out by the time we finished eating dinner. Their treats looked and smelled delicious though! ,Highly recommend this place for great vegan options!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/20/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"St.Roch was our final stop during our Miami trip! I love Chef Chloe and saw on her Instagram that she had opened up a cafe at this new market. Obviously I had told my fiancé that I wanted to check out this place well before we even got to Miami! Lucky for me he made sure we ended our trip with brunch at St.Roch Market. His friends who live in Miami hadn't heard of this food hall yet (I deff felt like an insider lol). St. Roch Market is part of a newly developed high end shopping center. It is modern, has a variety of food vendors (Israeli, sushi, Mexican, Vietnamese, vegan desserts, full bar, coffee shop, Italian, acai bowls/juice shop etc), AND tons of seating! We also saw a birthday party going on- so that's something to keep in mind if you need a place to celebrate.Their eyes almost popped out of their heads as they walked around trying to decide what to eat! I opted for a falafel platter from the Israeli vendor (Jaffa). The food was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully presented! For dessert I obviously went to Chef Chloe's cafe and got a chocolate chip sea salt cookie- chewy, perfect sweet/salty balance & ginormous chips atop the cookie (total win!) The guys tried the sushi, bhan mi sandwich, sushi, Mexican corn, the shawarma platter, and coffee. Everyone loved their food and they can't wait to bring their friends/S.O  #yourwelcome #thanksinstagram"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/4/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So excited about this new food market in the design district! Plenty of ethnic food options for a price that's relatively affordable, especially when considering the design district location! Exciting to have exciting new food options in this food hall, instead of common chains that I'm used to seeing around Miami. Hard to decide between all of the food vendors, especially since all had vegetarian and vegan friendly options. Will be back to try out more!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"I loved this place since I found out about it 3 months ago. It's great to have several different options so everyone in the group is happy, wherever your vegan or a total carnivore like me. I've tried 3 of the places already, and loved the Vietnamese food particularly, but can't wait to try everything since I haven't been disappointed yet. It's great to have both seating outside and inside with beautiful hammock/chairs under canopy of vines."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/2/2018,$$,3,St. Roch Market,"Looks like the food market idea is becoming more popular now. It's a great concept since there's a variety for all taste buds! I ordered ""Yuzu's"" Vegan noodle bowl and it was tasty, good size, but way too pricey. I paid $19, and felt it was a bit absurd for ramens.  My boyfriend had ""Hot Lime"" which is the Mexican Taco spot... he loved it! He had the chicken, the shortie taco with beef short rib, and the vegan taco which were amazing, but they were too small, gone in 2 bites. But we'll definitely be back for the tacos and to try different spots."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So much better than I was expecting! The quality of everything was excellent and so much variety! This is the perfect spot to go to if you're with a group.. there is something for everyone! Oyster bar, juice/smoothie bowl bar, hummus bar, asian fusion, Italian, tacos/ceviche, Vietnamese, vegan bakery, southern soul food.. all top quality."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Today was my second time here. Chef Chloe's place is ok... now there's only one savory option and it's the truffle avocado toast. How creative. Before there was a few other things and they were worth the visit, but now those are out. The vegan desserts have been on the dry side, none of them mind blowing. ,However, pretty much all the other vendors have amazing vegan options. Jaffa has plenty of Mediterranean plates and dairy free ice cream flavors. Don't miss out on this place. Healthy food with lots of flavor. ,The Japanese place has vegan sushi rolls which were delicious. ,Happy hour at the bar is great too."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/19/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"So far I've tried a banh mi from Tran An, sushi roll from Itamae, ramen from Yuzu, açaí bowl from Sweetblendz, and desserts and nachos from Chole and the Vegan Cafe. Everything was good, but the only place that really stood out to me was Chole and the Vegan Cafe.,Which also made me realize, this food hall is relatively vegan friendly. There's the obvious Chloe and the Vegan Cafe whose desserts have me thinking about them days later. But also, Yuzu makes a vegan ramen. I'm still on the hunt for a satisfying bowl of ramen in Miami, but the one at Yuzu is not bad (they'll even split it into two bowls if you want to share a few different things with a friend!).,If you're deciding between food halls, I prefer 1-800 Lucky in Wynwood or even Jackson Hall in the Health District. But St. Roch Market definitely fills a niche of its own in the bougie Miami Design District."
"12055 SW 117th Ave, Miami, FL 33186",1/5/2017,$$,4,Hole In The Wall,"I've had good experiences at this restaurant sports bar every time I've visited. In the past, I've come here with big groups of people, and they were always accommodating and the service was always great. I honestly can't recall the menu or what I had ordered too well, but since it's a sports bar the vegan options are probably limited. But they do have a good selection of drinks, I remember ordering some good beer last time I visited. It's a fun place to go with a group since sports bars tend to be louder and more tolerant of big groups, understandably. I remember the restaurant being a moderate sized, not too big but spacious enough. I had a good time here in the past, and I will definitely be coming back here with friends next time I visit the arcade next door."
"1071 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/25/2017,$,4,Firito Taco,"Totally unexpected treat! The tacos are very fresh, and you can see the cook prepping everything with love. The bahn mi tacos were good and the short rib quesadilla was even better. I also tried the vegan and the Jorochito. ,Everything was good, i'd definitely go back."
"1071 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/29/2017,$,5,Firito Taco,"My favorite taco spot in Miami..& my boyfriend is Mexican so I'm dealing with high standards lol. We LOVE LOVE LOVE. Vegan tacos are delicious btw. ,The place has a small selection of items on the menu but it keeps with the charm of the place & trust me you'll never get tired of them. ,I don't eat meat or dairy or gluten..a know..BUT this place is the perfect choice for those of us who still want to indulge with our love ones in a 'regular' way.,Try it!!! You have to!"
"1071 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/2/2018,$,5,Firito Taco,"Great ambiance, outdoor seating. 5 tall seats inside and many picnic tables outside. Great tacos - 2 for $7. Vegan taco available with a little spicy sauce. Great staff! Few parking spots"
