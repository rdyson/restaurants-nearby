"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/2/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"The food here is delicious. The cococurry panini is my favorite. They have vegetarian and vegan options, which is a plus. Downsides: seating is limited, it's a bit pricey, and there can be very long lines and waiting times for food. They open at noon on weekdays; if they opened at 11:30 it would add a lot of lunchtime flexibility for those who attend/work at FIU, this restaurant's primary clientele."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/20/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"this is one of my FAVORITE places to go eat!!! I'm always craving it! the environment is really cute and cozy :-) definitely order the Vegan Coco Curry Panini and the Arnoldo Palmer, you wooon't be disappointed!"
"4740 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/3/2014,$$,5,Shokudo,"Great atmosphere without all the pretentiousness going on a little south of there in the DD. Friendly waitstaff and super friendly owner. Yes, the owner was there and working to make sure everything was enjoyable. I love when I'm eating at an establishment where an owner cares enough to be around. The service was quick, but not pushy. Each and every dish was excellent. I'm not sure what the name of the dish was, but it was one of the few vegan options...something curried. We ended up eating two of them...I also had the ramen soup. SOLD! It was awesome. The egg was perfectly poached...I'll have to remember to write down what we eat next time. I hope that next time is very soon. Great place and glad to see it is doing so well."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",5/4/2013,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"Been coming to specialtea for a while now and it is great. Food and tea are fantastic and they have Sweetwater coffee! As a former Gainesvillian that keeps me perpetually excited. Great veggie and vegan options, great wraps and paninos, and great salads.,The service used to be slow but it seems like they have been working on that as the last few times I've been things have been great.,Updating my review:,I've been coming here for a couple years now and quality has progressively gone down while price has gone up and the menu has gotten smaller. Friendly, personal service that may have taken a little way has gone. Now you get faster service from people who don't care nearly as much and aren't as personable. It all makes me very sad."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",11/20/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"100% vegan friendly food, EXCELLENT service, delicious meals, amazing teas, great selection of baked goods, it doesn't get any better than this place. The atmosphere is great. The food is great. The prices are great. I wish I could go there every day."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/24/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is one of the few places in Miami you can find VEGAN desserts. Even more rare, they are delicious and affordable! Not only that, but the atmosphere here is amazing and the staff are extremely friendly. Top hangout spot for sure! Beats Starbucks any day"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",5/12/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Delicious! Beautiful on the inside. Had the coconut curry vegan style panini. 5 stars. Coming back. A subtly sweet and spicy taste.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/7/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"If you are looking for a chill place to have lunch by FIU or an early dinner, plus a bomb cup of coffee or tea, this is your place.  They have a wall of teas, vegan options, and the desserts are insanely decadent.,The food is AMAZING!!! Everything is made with organically, locally grown ingredients and lotsa love :)  Seriously, you haven't lived until you've had their Coco Curry Panini... chicken, cheese, bread, coconut dipping sauce... Who knew this was the perfect food marriage? , ,Every single person I have brought to this place falls in love with it and returns. The portions are big, the prices, comparably small to Starbucks. The food is always fresh. The eco-friendly restaurant is always clean. There are board games available for tables to play. Wifi is free for customers. ,It is owned by a couple, and they are always there working. The downside to this is the place is only open one shift. If they get sick, the restaurant does not open. They close Sundays. If they have an outta town weekend, SpecialTea is closed then too. This bothers some people quite a bit, but is easily remedied if you follow them on Facebook. They post their current hours (open and close later during the summer), days where they plan to be closed, and of course pictures of all their CRAZY-DELICIOUS baked goods. ,Go. ,Seriously."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/11/2012,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I love love loooove SpecialTEA!  My question is why aren't there more places in Miami like this???  There is a huge selection of teas, ranging from green, white, black, oolong, rooibos, honeybush, mate, and fruit tisanes.  Along the wall by the cash counter you can smell each of the tea leaf mixtures in tin cans.  But they also specialize in coffees, with all kinds of expresso, lattes, cappuccinos.  I'm not as big of a coffee fan as I am of tea, but man, it's a choice selection!  But wait, there's more, they have their cafe menu, and while I haven't ventured as much in trying their delish paninis and wraps... I've had their Coco-curry vegan (yes, you can make it vegan) spinach wrap, with that mmm-so-good coconut sauce. Oh my!  You will be salivating for more!  (I'm guilty, I've had it at least 3x now) ,There is a bit of a wait every time we go in, but that is because the owner is there taking orders and tailoring each customer's specific requests.  It's worth the wait.  When I step into this place, I'm gonna want to take my time and lounge!  It ain't no grab-in-go Starbucks!  ,Then there is the ambiance.  It's a cute and cozy place, but can get filled up pretty quickly. Still, it's a great place to get away to study, or take a break from studying and play a board game (they have a ton of games!  deluxe scrabble anyone?) ... yes, with your new-found favorite vegan wrap coupled with the gunpowder temple of heaven green tea, or honey vanilla white tea, or frozen rooibos red expresso, or, or... the list is pretty endless.  Do try it, your taste buds will thank you for it."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/30/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"SpecialTea Lounge is a unique, hipsteresque tea house that truly caters to college students. They have the best salads, panini's, and wraps in all of Westchester. They also have a wide selection of teas to chose from, both hot and cold, to accompany your meal. Every day they make fresh pastries such as cookies and croissants. They are also vegan friendly! They are open until late, and just recently started opening on Saturday's. With free wifi, board games, and communal book shelf, it's easy to see why college students love this location so much. The only thing that I would have to warn you about is wait times and seating. Depending on the time of day you decide to go, you may experience long lines and a long wait due to short staff. Also, there is limited seating so you will have to take your meal to go or sit outside (which in this Miami heat is the last resort). Other than that, I have to say that the ambiance, food, drinks, and music will have you returning back!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/7/2015,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"We need more places like this more spread out across Miami. Great atmosphere with board games, books and Tv's oh, and free WiFi! Wide selection of teas to choose from and paninis, wraps and salads. My personal favorite is the coco curry, pesto and ay chihuahua. Is vegan and vegetarian friendly. Enjoy the desserts they display by the cashier, choose from different tea assortment accessories as well. The only thing I don't like is how expensive it has gotten. Before you could get a solid meal for $6-$7 now minimum is probably around $10 :( I think they should lower their prices a bit since it's so close to FIU for more broke college students to enjoy!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"In a sea of boring and cookie cutter coffee shops, is refreshing to have a local one where one can go to have a nice cup Joe. The salads are awesome.  The sandwiches are plentiful, and they cater to vegetarians and vegans! The only drawback is that if you eat there you will come out smelling like food.  So, I highly suggest for the management to increase their exhaust system, and maybe people will stick around a little longer."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/17/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Love this place! Conveniently located next to FIU, so this is quickly becoming my off-campus fave for a healthy lunch study session. Their teas are great, especially love their fruit infusions. The food is great too, lots of vegan options. You really can't beat their vegan cookies either."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/23/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Everything in this place, literally took me to a state of meaningfulness. Starting from the atmosphere, decor, seating arrangements, music selection, smells and  color schemes, as well as the amenities (book exchange, magazines, board games, guitar). To top it all off, the food is mouth watering, healthy and tasty. Not to mention the amazing varieties of coffees, teas, and vegan friendly baked goods that are to die for!! SpecialTEA Lounge is a loving piece of Heaven! The creator behind this idea of a lounge, totally outdid himself! 5 out 5 Star Rating."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/10/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Best chocolate chip vegan cookies on earth. Thus far. Paninis are delicious. I've also gotten a salad before and it was spectacular. ,The staff can be a little rude but the food and tea surpass the bitterness."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/14/2014,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I was drawn to this place since the Yelp event the attended.  The vegan walnut brownies are AMAZING!  The curry chicken panini is also amazing.  That's my daughters favorite sandwich when she goes.  You can't go wrong with the desserts and sweets they have.  The chocolate chip cookies are just oh so yummy.  This is a cool spot for a college kid to hang out.  I know it makes my daughter excited about getting into college because of the vibe, food and music. Lol. I come from Homestead to this place every now and then or stop by if I take turnpike hm from wk.  The tea here is nice and refreshing but the strawberry-banana smoothie is AMAZING!  I purchased it for the baby to have a drink and when I took a sip I had to get a cup and ask the baby if she can share. Thank goodness she said yes lol. But as for my oldest she got a no lol. ,Great place for food and refreshing drinks and the salads and sandwiches are of a huge portion to me. Both my daughter and I can barely make it through a half piece of a panini. Well worth the money and stop."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/31/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"This place is great. Nice menu selection and variety of teas, smoothies, frappes, etc... It is a little on the more expensive side however you get what you pay for. It is high quality ingredients and it has some nice vegetarian and vegan options. Cute and quaint however you must have time when coming here because service can sometimes be a little slow and they are ALWAYS packed!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/19/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,This place is the titts! Vegan options and delicious I'll come here daily if I could :)
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/1/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Stop. I love. Omg. Can I type a proper sentence, please? The staff are SO friendly. There are board games to use. Books where you have to leave one in order to take one. And good menu options that can be made vegetarian or vegan. Place is small but cozy. Quaint for the university students to eat and do work or even get together to hang out. Have tea, some pastries - perfect place to go to for a meal or relax. I don't live around the area but I visit friends that do. I will definitely be going back -- can't wait"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/13/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I Love This Place! I'm so glad I Yelped! The sandwiches are great! Love the Variety! They offer Vegan friendly food too! Save room for the desserts, croissants and cookies! Yummy! It's more like a laid back lounge. The employees are very friendly and attentive! Definitely worth coming here!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",9/20/2016,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Delicious smoothies and shakes! I tried the mango matcha shake with added boba.. amazing. Also, I love that this place has vegetarian and vegan options! I am a vegetarian so I appreciate this local rarity. The reason for the missing star is lack of space to sit and eat. People hangout for awhile for the free wifi. I took my order to go (coco curry wrap) and sadly it wound up soggy."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/11/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Tried out the Farmer's Harvest with the ¡Ay Chihuahua! tofu subsituting for the chicken and oh my goodness! The vinaigrette was sweet but not too sweet and it complimented the dried cranberries perfectly. Without a doubt a great vegan option! ,The Tropical Delight loose leaf tea was a perfect way to end the meal. Its almost like drinking warmed Hawiian Punched without rotting out all of your teeth. ,The vegan cookie was just like the ""real"" thing. Its the perfect soft cookie.,Love this place like crazy! Cant wait to try more teas!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/15/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Best place ever! I'm vegan and I was so happy to find this place near me, I go once a weekend probably! It is that good.  The Ay Chihuahua vegan in a panini is out of this world! Recomended"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/16/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,I finally made it here early in the day and their bakery case was stocked !  Yeah!  They had a vegan chocolate chip and matcha vegan chocolate chip cookies. I got them both... They were delicious .  You would never know they were vegan.  I got an almond croissant for a friend.  She gave it 5 stars.  I also ordered an iced coffee with almond milk.  Good strong coffee.  I am looking forward to coming back here again for lunch one day.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/17/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"The tea selection is good and the food is tasty, especially the vegan cookies. Love the take-a-book, leave-a-book idea, as simple as it may seem. The booths are comfy and the outlets work which is always a plus."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/3/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,This place is a hidden gem. The atmosphere is so welcoming and warm and so is the staff. Our cashier John Paul was very attentive and friendly. Our vegan cookies were better than any dairy cookie we've had and the boba is the best in the city. Definitely recommend.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2014,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"Menu has completely changed and very limited, more catered to the vegan side but still very limited.  You no longer have the option of picking an item and choosing how you want it.   The tea selection is now also limited.  Fortunately the selection of sandwiches they do have is still made good and delicious hence the 3 stars.  My favorite is still the coco curry, i am sad you cant switch up the chicken to steak or change to salad any more.  ,I will still return when im craving for sandwich but other then that im sad they limited their menu and tea selection hence why they are no longer really busy."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is the right place to go to when you want to treat yourself! It can get a little pricey but it's so worth it. As someone with dietary restrictions, their vegan menu is great! I normally go there to get a peach boba smoothie and some of their vegan desserts. Their chocolate chip cookies are out of this world, I could only dream of making something vegan taste that good! Also it's located nicely around FIU so I can swing by if I've had an extra long day. Love specialTEA!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/23/2014,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Special Tea is a very easy place to fall in love with. It's a hidden gem - cozy ambience, every tea you could hope for, delicious coffee, and so many vegetarian options it's almost completely vegan. ,My favorite go to wrap is their ""ay Chihuahua"" selection... But unfortunately the wrap isn't the only thing saying ""ay"", my wallet is too. It pains me not giving them five stars but I just can't get myself to be okay with paying $9.50 for a wrap, no matter how delicious. ,They have free WiFi, a book selection, board games available, comfy couches and one of the best playlists I've heard always playing. ,Almost $20 for a wrap/salad/panini and some tea/coffee is worth it if you have the time to really just enjoy yourself and take advantage of the place. If you're looking for a quick bite don't come splurge here.,I usually treat myself after a test since its so close to FIU!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/7/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Absolutely love this place! The setting is so peaceful, the food is amazing, and the customer service is great. The mango boba slushy is my absolute favorite along with the vegan chocolate chip cookies. The pesto chicken is incredible. Definitely recommend coming here whether you're on the go or looking somewhere quiet to relax and get some work done."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/25/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"OMG I have lived just blocks away from this place forever and never gave it a try! As a brand new vegan, I decided to give them a try since they have so many vegan options! Let me tell you....paninis were amazing!! The vegan cookies are to die for... almost tasted just like the Subway cookies!! Not to mention, the staff is super friendly and helpful picking your food. The place has various tables ready and setup with chargers for the hardworking students and professionals. They also have a take one - leave one book shelf which is AMAZING!! I will definitely be coming again!!!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/22/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Absolute must if you are in the FIU area. I love this place! If you love tea in all shapes and sizes, this is the place to go. I always get the Arnaldo Palmer, which is made with the brew of the day so it always varies, lemonade and mint leaves. I also love the Ay Chihuahua! which is a wrap that has that Tex-mex feel. The good thing here is that everything is organic and very fresh. I've ordered this wrap like 10 times and it always tastes the same, which is a plus. Their Hunny Brisket is also really good. Even though the menu is not super long you can pick if you want the items to be in a panini, wrap or salad. Another thing they are amazing at is making VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. I know it sounds weird but seriously they are better than normal ones. Also, their vegan matcha chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING. ,Aside from all this, people come here to relax and study. I met with a group project there and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It is quiet, they have a TV with the news and also some sofas so people can get comfy. Definitely a hidden gem in the FIU area."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/6/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"What a great little spot! They have a big collection of teas, and they make an assortment of paninis and baked goods with plenty of vegan options. I got the double chocolate chip vegan cookie with the caramel coffee and it was delicious. It gets pretty crowded with people studying since it's right by fiu and they offer free wifi. But overall I highly recommend it."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/9/2015,$,3,specialTEA Lounge,"I really do love this place. There's a tiny part of me that just wants to be there all day. But. The prices are crazy. A slush with boba is almost 6 dollars. But they are so delicious... They do offer one type vegan cookie a day, but once they run out that's about it. So I usually leave without my vegan cookies...,The employees are nice but are very slow. It usually takes a while before I start receiving parts of my order but it has always been correct. All in all it is a cute place with good food but be prepared to pay way too much for it. ,(Also their hours are weird and they should be open more.)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/19/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I have tried their paninis and wraps as well as a few drinks in their menu including hot chocolate and various bubble tea variations. I can vouch that the customer service is top notch and that they have many options including a plethora of vegan options. For any drink they always ask you what milk you would like. They have soy, almond, whole, skim, and coconut milk.  I'll occasionally get the cocounut milk, but the drinks themselves are good regardless of the dairy/non-dairy option you choose. They also have board games and books that you can use and a few booth seats. The location is a bit small, so if you bring a large group of people you may not find seats for everyone. They do have seats outside and two couches to sit on as well as some booths and tables inside. Their croissants are really unique and taste great. You can ask them to warm the croissants for you and they are made right there daily, so no fear of non fresh pastries. They also have free WiFi, a printer that you pay $0.14 per page to print at, and outlets where you can plug in your laptop or tablet if you need to. Great place to relax and study or just hang out with friends to play board games. I don't drink, but for those who like unique beers, they also have a large menu of alcoholic beverages. Really one of my favorite places to just relax."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/14/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This has to be my favorite place to study, hangout with friends and eat! It's a hip environment with an abundance of board games to play, books to read and teas to drink. I highly recommend everyone to come check it out especially if your vegan! This place has a lot of options for you plant based lovers"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",11/29/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This place is awesome and so are their vegan chocolate chip cookies, the environment is very welcoming and the staff is attentive. I wish they could be open at least a little bit longer on Saturday but it's cool that their open till Midnight on weekdays. Just know that the kitchen closes 11:30 PM if I'm not mistaken. So don't get there too late if you want a late night snack (that's healthy) ...I learned my lesson. :-) the window seats could be comfier but it's not too bad. Definitely worth the drive if you don't live around FIU though, so give it a go!!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/20/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Quaint and cozy, the atmosphere was calm and inviting. There was a great variety of Teas and vegan friendly sweeteners. The farm salad was fresh and delicious, filled with cashews, dried cranberries, mandarin slices, on a bed of spinach and kale, topped with seasoned chicken and and they have numerous of sauces to go with the salad. Besides the salads the other options are great fresh and vegan friendly. If your looking for a nice location to enjoy a good healthy meal this place is highly recommended."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/10/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Delicious food and the bakery is amazing can't believe the cookies are vegan so gooooooood.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/28/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,Absolutely love this place! Best place to study and they even have beers! The food is delicious and the staff is awesome! P.S best vegan chocolate chip cookies ever!!!
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",10/7/2016,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This place has a very casual and friendly ambiance. They have a great selection of healthy goods and they have vegan chocolate chip cookies. This place is a hidden gem. They have amazing choices for tea, coffee, beer and Boba drinks! Purchase anything and you will get free chips!  They even have a book shelf and board games for you to enjoy while youre indulging. Definitely will be back soon to try their variety of healthy wraps and vegan desserts."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/24/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Awesome lounge with lots of food to choose from including vegan options. I have enjoyed their paninis, organic teas and bubble tea. I noticed organic local coffee beans for sale as well. ,Chill music, lots of board games, books and wifi. Service is friendly, quick, and professional. Always a laid back atmosphere. ,I recommend coming here if you're bored and want to get out of the house.,They're open late too which is a plus."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/31/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I've been coming here for over a year and the employees already know me by name. It's a great place to study or to grab a bite and play a board game. Although I wish the place was bigger, they do have a couple of different areas to sit and even some tables outside. As for the food I've never been disappointed. I recommend getting the iced matcha latte with almond milk and the coco curry panino! Also don't leave before trying the matcha vegan cookies (best cookies ever!)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/13/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I found specialTEA while visiting Miami, and now that I'm back in Maryland I'm heartbroken that I can't eat their vegan cookies every day. They had 3 kinds on the day I went - chocolate chip, double chocolate, and green tea chocolate chip. That last one sounds crazy, but it was amazing (they all were). I'm kind of a connoisseur of baked goods :) and can honestly say these are some of the best cookies I've ever had. My two non-vegan sisters were really impressed by them too, and frankly their ""can I have a bite"" requests turned into eating a lot more than I'd hoped. :) ,We didn't stop there for long since we were on our way back from a day trip and were tired, so we got everything to go, but the atmosphere was really nice. The barista who helped me couldn't have been friendlier. And the boba tea (I had vanilla black tea with soy milk) was completely fantastic. ,Check them out!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/14/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Excellent food, drinks, service and ambience. Professional and friendly staff. They have a vegetarian and vegan friendly menu. It's a nice place to spend a few hours catching up with friends, reading a book, doing some work or simply to grab a quick bite. I like to go to this place to write my papers."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",8/27/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,My partner and I came here on a rainy day. I love the vibe of this place! It's a good location to hang out with friends or study. I love the vegan options (the Harvest salad was huge and so good!) and you can't leave without trying their cookies! I had one of each kind and they were all delicious. Service was good and the coffee hit the spot! My only complaint would be how small the place is.
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/22/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I've been going here for 6 years and I've tried everything and it's honestly the best food and drink and chill spot in all of Miami. Especially if you are vegetarian or vegan. ,I am always there so I guess I'll see you soon, potential customer.,Try the Ay Chihuahua or the Coco Curry. I add bean salsa to everything. Have it with a matcha cookie and a cold brew.,Have that exact combination."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/26/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"As ridiculous as it may sound, if I ever had to choose a last meal, specialTeas's Ay Chihuahua wrap would be the first thing that would come to mind. Having attended FIU for four years, specialTea became an almost daily (and joyous) visit. From their multitudes of tea to their various vegan pastry options, this is by and large one of the best restaurants I've been to. It's a great place to eat, study/do work, and/or hangout.,If you do get a chance to visit you should try the ay chihauha wrap, the vegan chocolate chip cookies, and the arnold palmer ( their spin on the arnold palmer (they use their tea of the day + lemonade + mint leaves)).,If I am ever in the Tamiami area I make it a point to visit specialTea."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/2/2017,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Really cool atmosphere, good service. It can get pretty packed sometimes. Try the vegan cookies."

It's a good, chill place to get some homework done too. They have a bunch of tea options and if you go - have the oolong tea with a vegan chocolate chip cookie. So yummy!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",2/4/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,Nice little tea and food cafe. Seems to be very conscious of vegan and vegetarian diets. Food tastes good and they carry a variety of teas.

"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/6/2018,$,4,specialTEA Lounge,"Cool, hip little coffee/tea shop right next to FIU. The employees were friendly and there's plenty of seating available. I ordered the olive panini which has fresh spinach, olive tapenade, & mozzarella. The portion is pretty big so I could only finish half and then I ordered a couple of the vegan cookies which were to DIE for!!!!!!!! My only constructive feedback would be that the floors were a bit dirty, a little upkeep and sweeping wouldn't hurt :) Aside from that, I'd definitely return for some more vegan baked goods and to try out some of their teas from their wide selection."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/2/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"Amazing place! Favorite cafe in all of miami. It has good food, bubble tea, many vegan options, friendly vibes and awesome customer service."
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/13/2017,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"This is one of my favorite places to eat! I go to FIU and this is the kind of food place I would sacrifice my parking spot for! Luckily, now that they deliver I don't have to! I love their cookies!! ALL the cookies, the vegan and Matcha are my favorite though. The cookies and cream shake is so great too, especially since I can request it with almond milk. The Pesto Panini is my go-to meal. This is a much needed place near campus. They've expanded recently and have a printing station! Their workers are super helpful as well, they've often gone above and beyond whenever an issue arose. I also love that they have books and board games. The atmosphere is so great, they're environmentally friendly AND serve beer now. Definitely worth it!,Update: 3/6,I forgot to mention how incredibly amazing their online ordering ordering system is. It's intuitive, responsive, and delightfully detailed. The options allow you to truly customize your order and I love that you can pinpoint where you are on the map so that the delivery person knows exactly where to drop off your goodies. (This is incredibly helpful if you're on campus)"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",4/2/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"AMAZING!! First, the greeting from the staff was extremely welcoming. I am so glad I visited this place. There were many options on the menu especially for vegans:) The service was quick and the food was delicious! The vegan cookies (cookies and cream for sure) are so good. I will definitely be going back. A+ loved it all."

"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",1/31/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"I was first introduced to this place during my first week of school at FIU by a friend. On my first visit, I simple purchased chips and guac, with not much expectations. Wow was i surprised by the freshness and flavor of the guac and the chips were perfect, strong enough to hold the thickness of the guac. On my next visit, I tried the ay chihuahua wrap and it soon became my go-to wrap at this place. I love their fresh vegan cookies too! After your first visit, they give you a 20% discount for the next visit so you can't beat that. It's a good place to chill and study but you might want to get there early to get a table or a spot. Overall, specialTEA is pretty much that reliable hang-out spot you go to near school when you are just looking to be with your friends!"
"10766 SW 24th St, Miami, FL 33165",6/10/2018,$,5,specialTEA Lounge,"So, I'm trying to eat healthy and started searching for healthy places near my fiancé and I...I came across this place on yelp (caught my attention instantly) with 4.5 stars and over 600 reviews. We decided to go for dinner and OH MY GOODNESS! De-li-cious! I had the ""Ay chihuahua"" in a garlic & herb wrap and my fiancé had the same but in a panini. We absolutely loved it!! We also tried their vegan cookies and you would never guess they are vegan. They're soft, chewy and super yummy! The location is in a shopping center near night owl cookies and it's a little hidden. Very small and cozy ambiance, they have tons of board games you can play, and since it's near FIU you'll see quite a few people with their laptops studying inside. However, there is seating outside as well. The staff is super friendly which is always a huge plus!...We will definitely be returning again soon"

The details, the attention, the food, the service.. I cannot express how grateful I feel for such a delightful experience. Im Vegan and there is great Vegan & Vegetarian options, my guests also had fish & meat & everybody loved the food. The drinks were delicious as well. Thank so much!

Only getting 3 stars because of the service. I ordered the vegan burger it was delicious not the best I've ever had. My wife ordered the chicken and waffles she loved them. I ordered the Mac and cheese but sent it back. If you're not into really cheesy mac, then its not for you"
"638 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",3/17/2013,$$,4,Bonding,"I used to come here when it was called Indochine and boy am I happy they changed owners and did a re-design.  Everyone was very satisfied with both Thai and Japanese dishes they ordered.  The owner even accommodated two vegan diners in our party with a special dish for them.  Also, for the quality of food, the price was perfect.  Its rare that you find a place that hits that trifecta of great food, great service, and great prices.  Highly recommended."
"8870 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2018,$,4,Mojo Donuts & Fried Chicken,"Great donuts! The coffee is pretty underwhelming, unfortunately, which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. The donuts I had were all really tasty. Not sure about vegan options since I went there worked to going vegan."
"2751 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2017,$$,3,SuViche - Wynwood,"This was my first time here, and I knew nothing about this place.  I was looking for seafood and found this close to where I was. We had sushi, ceviche, quinoa salad, ""Saltado veggie"" (great idea), and the ""Chaufa"" quinoa veggie (great idea).  I thought everything was decent, but not extraordinary.  It was takeout so sometimes that makes a difference.  I Loved the ""Saltado veggie"" it had the beef sauce and all that flavor without the beef.  The reason they are getting 3 stars is because while the ceviche seasoning was Good, the fish itself was a bit hard.  I don't know if it was over-""cooked"", old, or not fresh, so I was disappointed with this.  The service was Good because after I called to confirm the order, the server called me back to find-out if I was vegan, and said they could make the Saltado without the beef sauce, and the Chaufa without eggs."
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/28/2015,$$$,4,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"Went to Swine for lunch this past Thursday with a party of six. The first thing that stands out is the wonderful hickory smoke smell. My vegan and vegetarian co-workers were not the biggest fans, but it really adds to the flavor of the place. The ambience is awesome, very modern yet country. Several members of my party couldn't help but take pictures of the cool setup. I ordered the Ribs with Mac & Cheese, Grits, and Corn Bread. The Ribs were a little disappointing, but the sides were all amazing. I also got a chance to try out the Swine Burger, which was something I wish I had ordered. My vegan and vegetarian co-workers were all satisfied as well with a cauliflower and apple soup and the large variety of salads. The real problem we ran into was the service or lack of. It was a workday and we expressed our urgency, but our server kept disappearing and we ended up at the restaurant much longer than we would have wanted. So do not come expecting a quick meal, but if you have time to kill the food is well worth it."
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/22/2013,$$$,5,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"Prepare to do battle against the Vegans!,Best BBQ meal I've  had in a long while. ,We sampled almost everything here. You really cant go wrong. ,Even if you don't go for appetizers, just get the burnt ends anyway. You'll thank me later. Bone marrow wasnt very  notable. For entree's the stand outs were the ribs, and the brisket. Mind blowingly good!,The mac and cheese is great but almost too cheesy. ,Desserts are okay, you aren't mising anything too special if you have no room left or if you are"
"2415 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/21/2015,$$$,4,Swine Southern Table & Bar,"BEST OLD FASHIONEDS EVER! The food is good too. You need to be in the mood for a meat feast as there are few Vegetarian or Vegan options. However, the food is prepared well and good quality. Fun for groups of friends  & date night as well."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Great tacos great atmosphere. Went here during art walk late one night and was so surprised. I got the carne asada tacos and they were exactly what I wanted them to be. Real authentic Mexican tacos. Not that Tex mex junk. A little wedge of lime and some salsa verde and my life was made. I also got a side of guac and chips =amazing. Kinda weird tho bc if you order guac it doesn't come with chips, they're separate. But whatever. They chips were fresh and maybe the best I've had. I was concerned bc my friend is a vegan and I was expecting them to not have a vegan option but they did (I think it was cactus and quinoa) which she said were good. I was veryyyy full and very happy."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,5,Coyo Taco,"At least a couple good vegetarian/vegan options. Very good guac. I assume they use California Hass avocados instead of gross watery Florida ones, but I could be wrong about that."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/19/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,Best tacos in Wynwood. Comes two per order and wide variety to choose from. For the meat lovers as well as the vegans and pescatarians. Cold brews and a good selection of fresh made sauces to customize your taco.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2015,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Came here after a moto ride down to mia and they guys didn't seem to fond of the place but I thought it was pretty good. Guys are super picky anyways. Being a vegan, I ordered the nopales without cheese or sauce and it must have been too difficult to not put cheese on it. I had to send it back to the kitchen and they took some of the cheese off and gave it back to me. Things NOT to do to a vegan. I ended up eating around it because I'm not that much of a bitch. I also ordered a side of black beans (which were refried). Overall I thought the tacos were really good and I'm never gonna live down the heat of ordering a cactus taco LOLZ"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,Coyo Taco,Loved this place! The food was great...freshly prepared and fast. I loved the vibe and they had a dj and the music was awesome and eclectic.  It was vegan friendly which was a huge plus. The line was long but they moved fast and it was worth the wait. Definitely a cool spot to grab some good food and drinks that's super casual. I'm a pretty picky eater and I enjoyed this place.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/7/2017,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"NOM NOM NOM. so freaking tasty. Food is fresh, amazing quality, options for vegans/vegetarians and great vibe too. Love the outdoor seating. I am giving this place stars because I think for a place with such amazing tacos, they could def make some better guac! Margs are great here too. Never would have thought that a mushroom taco would taste so out of this world! Other than that, keep it up Coyo!"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"I had dinner here a few weeks ago, before exploring art walk and the galleries. And by dinner I mean, I nibbled on some tortilla chips with salsa. Lol. It's not the best place to go if you're vegan, but I realize that it's not a restaurant that is focused on that...but right next door there is a vegan friendly cafe! So keep that in mind if that's what you're craving. ,Anyway, Coyo Taco is okay butttt I really wish they had offered more veggie tacos. They didn't have a lot of options, even for vegetarians (from what I saw, but perhaps I am too picky), and the place just didn't seem to do it for me. Something about their tacos seemed unappetizing. Their prices were decent enough, and the location is great (who doesn't love Wynwood?), but if you're looking to eat tacos, there are other places to enjoy a meal in Miami which are much more aesthetically pleasing, committed to all dietary needs, spacious, and just more fun overall. We were barely able to find seats because the restaurant was overcrowded (and it was earlier in the night, too). I suppose it is meant to be an in and out food joint, and not really a place to lounge and enjoy the night."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/3/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"This place is always busy and it's definitely because of their food and their club room behind their restaurant. However, they don't have a huge array of options and I wouldn't consider their service to be that great either. The lady who was serving me clearly knew I was vegan and she deliberately added cheese to the mushroom tacos I had ordered. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered the mushroom tacos since I'm not particularly a fan of them but I did manage to get a bite or two in before losing my appetite and switching over to their guacamole and chips. ,I honestly think when I come back to this area since my boyfriend likes this place and knows it's cheap in comparison to other restaurants, I'll either eat prior to coming or just order a portion of their guac and chips. They were absolutely delicious but the main reason I'm giving this place three stars is because their customer service really lacks and are quite rude. Also because they haven't bothered to try and add more seating which always means that a lot of people end up standing up while eating."

You start off with choosing your base (salad, bowl, or pita) then you choose your meat, then you choose all the toppings and sauces. One thing i love about this place is that the vegetable options change depending on the season. Vegan and vegetarian options too!"

I ask them to bake the falafels for me instead of fry them and they do it every time. I get half and half of the bulgur and spring mix, regular and red hummus, baked falafel, olives, pickled cabbage, lettuce, tabouli, and the a tomato cucumber mix they have. I switch it up with the dressings, they're all vegan and delicious!"

"1252 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",1/29/2016,$$,4,Neme Gastro Bar,"I had seen this place being opened next to Doggis and couldn't wait to try it out! We went one Friday night at around 10:30. We did have to have a few minutes because the place was quite full. They have live Jazz on Fridays and Saturdays which is great! The owner greeted us and was very attentive. But it was so full that everyone was running around. Our waiter was very nice but he kept coming back to ask usto repeat what we had ordered because he had forgotten. The owner gave us two drinks of our choice due to the wait, which was awesome though! Very nice of him. The menu though is quite limited, and it was very different. The food options are very different. For example, we had the Vegan chicharron, the PBJ friend chicken (Like chicken and waffles, but chocolate waffles with PB) and I also had the pork belly. I'm not sure if it was the mix of items all together that I didn't like. I think it was a little too much on the experimental side. Not exactly my cup of tea. The drinks though, were delicious. My favorite was called ""The Note"". It has guava which made it incredibly amazing. I would go just for drinks and music next time. It has a nice vibe. I do think they need to put speakers towards the entrance of the restaurant where we were sitting because we couldn't hear too well what the person was singing. I know they just opened and they're still getting everything together, but I definitely would like to go back just for drinks with some friends. It's a great late night place to go to."
"1252 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",1/17/2016,$$,5,Neme Gastro Bar,"After reading Cassie G's pick of the month featuring Peanut butter fried chicken with grape jelly, maduro walffle, and maple-aji my interest was definitely peaked and I quickly bookmarked.  This new gastro bar has a great vibe and a compilation of great jazz music.  All of the dishes offered are unique and creative.  The vegan chicharron is offered as a complimentary dish for starters.  The chicharron is sprinkled with a spiced coffee rub, cilantro and lime.  Wow, the chicharron melts in your mouth and the spice combination is unique.  ,Dishes ordered:,Tostones con Avocado:  I almost didn't want to order since this dish is offered in so many other places, but I am glad I ordered. The texture of the plantain was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the center.  The avocado had a great combination of flavors, citrus and cilantro, just perfect.,Belly L.T. Featured Pork Belly from Miami Smokers served on top of greens, grainy mustard, rock shrimp and croutons.  Also very good,PB & J A version of chicken and waffles both sweet and savory.  This dish is very creative, the chicken was moist and the waffles had a very unique savory taste.  All of the components of the dish held it's own.  Even though I loved this dish I couldn't taste the peanut butter and the jelly tasted more like tamarind than grape jelly.  That being said the dish is still phenomenal.,Peanut Butter Ice Cream with Maduros:,I can definitely taste the peanut butter in the ice cream.  The combination of the saltiness of the peanut butter and the sweetness of the maduros worked.  There was a subtle syrup, but I am not sure what is was.  I also liked this dish.  ,The unique and creative dishes served at Neme Gastro Bar, combined with the nice décor, ambiance and great jazz music is deserving of a five star experience.  Can't wait to come back to try the other dishes offered."

I have to say, this place has become my favorite go-to restaurant in Miami. Every time I have friends in town we stop by for delicious cocktails (especially the Chinese holiday), the addictive vegan pork rind appetizers, fresh vegetable dishes, and unique entrees. I find the entrees somewhat pricy, but definitely worth it if that's what you want. The staff is very accommodating and always lets my fiance know what is or can be made gluten free (she has celiac disease)."

It brings a new dimension to the Miami River and makes us hopeful for its future. The atmosphere is very nice. My wife said she felt she was in St Tropez. The service was good, and the food is ok. I ordered the sea bass (I cheated from my wanna-be-vegan diet).  The plate came a la carte which at $41 is a bit disappointing. The sauce was a bit too salty for my tastes. The $8 grilled vegetables were good. I would go back to take visitors or clients, but it wasn't good enough for me to go back for the food. My wife agrees."

Our waitress, Annabel, was very attentive and was very respectful towards my group of friends because we do not eat any animal products ! She gave us a couple of options and catered to our needs. She went as far as to veganize a soup that  usually has  meat in it ! It was extremely delicious. To conclude, my friends and i ordered the avocado roll, a veggie roll, and a tofu kimchi soup! All were so amazingg !!! I'd come here again and again !"
"3194 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",2/25/2017,$$,5,Atchana’s Homegrown Thai,"You can never go wrong with Thai food, especially at Atchana's. The restaurant was packed like a can of sardines when we got there, but luckily we got outside seating immediately. The vegetable spring rolls are amazing to start off with, but I would almost save my appetite for the main course. Being my first visit, I just had to order me some pad thai. I didn't want any meat with it, but luckily they were able to substitute with tofu as my protein. Since they have all fresh ingredients and make everything themselves, they are actually able to accommodate a wide variety of diets from food allergies, vegetarians, vegans, etcetera etcetera. The tofu pad thai was delicious and filling - I had enough to fill me for that night and as leftovers the next day.   To finish off my meal, I ordered the thai donuts. It tasted a little different then I am used to. It is more like glazed donut bites with coconut, fudge and chocolate chips on the side. I am used to the donuts being completely drenched in the condensed milk. I have very high expectations for service at restaurants, and Atchana's exceeds it. Our waiter was Bret, who was more then helpful. Aside from him, other staff members would come ask us how our meals were and just talk to us. I really hope this restaurant suceeds in the Grove, with it's great food and staff."

Then napoletana has no cheese , just skip the anchovies .  The verdura miste is oven roasted veggies with focaccia bread is vegan as long as you skip the goat cheese on the focaccia and skip the yogurt sauce.  I had this and although it was a full plate , it didn't leave me feeling full.  It would have been nice with a side of pasta or some other grain.  My coworkers ordered pizza and calzones and they were fairly happy with their plates.  Maybe when I go back for happy hour I will be able to give 4 stars :)"

Everything we ate was seasoned perfectly and very very flavorful. Try the mjaddarah as an appetizer. Really special treat! If you are a vegetarian or vegan, they have so many great options.

Highly recommended it to anyone who likes middle eastern cuisine, or anyone looking for great food in Miami."

There was a large variety including vegan options. We tried a bit of everything. They even offer dessert. Everything was hot, delicious and filling.  We loved the mango lassi."

"295 NW 82nd Ave, Miami, FL 33126",5/18/2018,$$,5,Ashoka Indian Cuisine,"Today we went here for the first time. I was undecided on what to eat, and as a vegan I don't usually have many options. I decided to look at what was around us, and this gem popped up. ,I Love love loooove this place!!!,The samosas were absolutely delicious. So flaky, crispy, spicy. ,the Rocket Naan super spicy but I could still not put it down. ,For my entree I ordered the Chikka Masala it was perfectly balanced, buttery, fragrant, and beautifully plated.,The basmati rice cooked to perfection.,My husband ordered the Lamb Malabar, I hear it was delicious.,For dessert I took one server's suggestion and ordered Kufi.,It is the best coconut homemade ice cream I have ever had. I wish I would have had space for more food.,The servings are generous. The service is great. The place is beautiful. The pricing is fair. It is clean, and comfortable.,We will definitely go back many more times!!"
"10200 NW 25th St, Doral, FL 33172",2/14/2018,$$,5,Bocas House- Doral,"I ordered this short ribs and fried yucc and substituted grilled veggies for the  sausage at no additional cost. this dish cost $35 but I was not prepared for the quantity. omg it was very plentiful both the ribs and the yucca.and delicious too. my sister is both vegan and has celiac disease so she can't eat gluten. she ordered the veggie rice, the restaurant was very accommodating. well worth the visit."
"10200 NW 25th St, Doral, FL 33172",5/20/2018,$$,5,Bocas House- Doral,"It's late, I'm tired from driving and Bacas has a full house. So I decided grab something to go. I have no idea what this dish is called but I do know it's Falafel and Quinoa. I must say for a simple dish it's absolutely delicious. They have limited options for vegans, I'm grateful I came here and able to order food. ,Atmosphere is the best, people enjoying themselves with others. Staff isn't chaotic, very confident crew. Ohh, very clean, organized and lots of smiles. Very very friendly hostess. This how Culture should be. Two thumbs up on every level."
"Miami International Airport, Miami, FL 33166",2/27/2016,$$,5,Corona Beach House,"I am not your typical customer at a restaurant like this. I might be seen as a pain in the butt to most servers. I'm vegan and gluten free, so I'll start with that. I'm in an airport, so I don't have many options. This is a burger and taco joint. Giovanni, my server was superb and I'm not one to write reviews, but I felt he really deserved to be lauded for his attitude and obviously solid work ethic. Excellent experience. On a side note, Oscar, the manager was hustling around, wiping tables and asking customers if everything was to their liking. I'm telling you, if we had more guys like these in all jobs, we would be so much better off. I hope whoever hired these guys keeps their eyes on them and offers them the first opportunity for advancement! I know this must sound like I know these guys, but I just want to let them know how much their service is appreciated. Great experience at a restaurant in an airport, no less!!! Thanks guys. As Ali G would say: ""Much respect!!"""
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/13/2017,$$,4,Mister 01- Brickell,"Nice brick oven pizza and very vegan friendly. I had vegan cheese with tomato, pineapple, mushrooms and basil. It was very satisfying and the perfect size for me! Ate the whole thing"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/15/2017,$$,4,Mister 01- Brickell,"Very good, thin, tasty pizza! Fast and friendly service. Did not like the plastic cups for the water too much, nor the foam cups for the really very delicious cappuccino. Would like to find salt, paper and some condiments on the table. the vegan options for pizzas and calzones!! Definitely will be back to eat there. Good price for value, good quality food - you can taste the real tomatoes !"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/26/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,Still my favorite pizza place! I love the Vegan Riccardo!! Very glad for the vegan options and I love that it's not bland. So full of flavor
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/15/2017,$$,3,Mister 01- Brickell,"I've heard many people say this is the best pizza in Brickell, but I got a vegan style, traditional Riccardo pizza and wasn't impressed. The ""cheese"" was pretty tasteless and the pizza in general lacked flavor. Also, my crust was burnt but not the tasty crisp kind, I looked around and everyone's crust looked delicious so I must've just had bad luck. I will try again though, but order a vegan calzone next time!"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/5/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,"This place was the bomb! Vegan pizza on point! Yassss Queens, slay that pizza game!"
"1000 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/20/2018,$$,5,Mister 01- Brickell,"Loved their pizza, specially the pinneaple and mushroom one. Can't wait to try the vegan ones."
"9971 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",2/29/2016,$,4,The Habit Burger Grill,"The customer service was great, the cashier was very informative about how my food was prepared, acknowledging my vegan preferences. The food was ok to good. Could be made a little better. It did fall apart a little, but that's what I get for ordering it to go. Nice scenery as they try to give it a very LA beach kind of vibe. Not being a picky eater or customer, I was overall satisfied. Can't give a final judgment on this restaurant, considering I only tried it once. Would go back here to try other foods."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/22/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This market has something from everyone plus a fun atmosphere! From sushi to italian to a delicious vegan bakery, St. Roch Market is the next big Food Hall in Miami. Located in the upscale Design District, this market has a center bar, lot's of seating, and 10 food vendors to choose from. You order you food, find a place to seat, and pick up your food when you recieve a text letting you know it is ready. The staff are all wonderful and will help you decide on what to get to eat. I recommend ending your meal over at Chef Chloe & The Vegan Cafe for an amazing treat. Their cookies, cakes, and more taste delcious and are the perfect dessert."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,So great! So many options. You can eat food from all over the world all at once. Very cool vibe and very nice people. Plus the Chloe vegan bakery is amazing. About time we got one in miami.
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/18/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Great new spot, lots of options. Try the authentic homemade pasta made on the spot, or the vegan options at Cleo - the cashew butternut cream nachos were amazing!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/25/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,Food was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly.  Amazing butternut squash soup - vegan!
"4141 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2014,$$$,5,MC Kitchen,"Depending on who you ask, many people would say that MC Kitchen is either the best or second best ""foodie"" restaurant in all of Miami, which means you will need a reservation even if the dining room doesn't look full. You don't come to a place like this only to miss out by being vegan, but it's vegetarian-friendly if you eat cheese.,We split 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 side dish between 2 people. We started with the Cobia Crudo which was flavorful but not very much food, and a dish we honestly could have done without. If you want something more substantial, the Black Mission Fig Pizetta was amazing, and can be made vegetarian by asking them to leave out the prosciutto.,The kale risotto came alongside the entree and was good, but paled in comparison to the real star of the meal, the Roasted Pear and Cheese Fiocchi. It's hard to describe how these delicate pockets of pasta and stuffing just satisfies down to the soul! It's creamy but thick, sweet but savory, solid but melts in your mouth, yet somehow still greater than the sum of all it's adjectives! Their truffles are imported from Italy, and the taste was very evident in the Fiocchi.,Because our meal had no meat to pair with wine, we asked the waiter to recommend a nice dessert wine and he supplied an irresistibly sweet but deceptively strong $60 Barefoot Moscato, which put the cherry (or grape) on top of a truly amazing meal."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2016,$$,3,Organic Bites,"Nice, small little restaurant on Biscayne, nice little patio area too, great vegan choices I had the quinoa and black bean salad, butternut squash soup and stuffed mushrooms. My girlfriend isn't vegan but she just wanted to have dinner and a few beers, only disappointment was when we arrived here they said they weren't allowed to sell us beer for some weird reason (we are well over 21), I ate my food for the sake of not getting up and leaving but I really picked this place over Choices down the street because they said they had beer, they gave me a cheap glass of white wine for the inconvenience but come on that's not the same as a good craft beer. Might try them again if they get their bar situation figured out."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/21/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"Awesome service, friendly staff, great food and vegan options. I LOVE their veggie burger! Very nice atmosphere as well."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/31/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"Visiting from Toronto with my vegan friend - we are both very health conscious foodies. This spot was a GREAT find! I prefer to eat organically/responsibly raised meat and OBites certainly delivered. The chicken was so fresh and juicy, we couldn't get enough so went back the next day for lunch! I had a rare burger and my friend had the veggie burger both times.,We also shared the burrata (mouth watering) and zucchini carpaccio. The juices are made in house and had great zing. Would love a place like this back home and will definitely be back next time!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/15/2015,$$,5,Organic Bites,"I work in the area so I have seen this location as several restaurants since the Metro days. Finally we have something that's just as good as Metro! As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see many vegetarian and vegan options, and they are delicious! The green seed salad is light on the dressing as it stays true to the flavor of fresh Ingredients. The Veggie Carpaccio was also a nice treat as I had never seen that before. Definitely a nice fresh appetizer perfect for our hit Miami weather. The owner/manager I dealt with was delightful which was a nice change from many other places in the area of this type. I'm really looking forward to coming here before work,To try their juices and coffees in the future!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/22/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,"I live close by and had a friend in town visiting. We wanted something healthy and with some vegan options for me. We decided to try Organic Bites and we were pleasantly surprised. ,Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some suggestions. She was a fun girl with a great spirit. I had the squash soup and the zucchini pasta, both of which were amazing. My friend had the chicken entrée with quinoa and scarfed it down!,The portion are perfect. We got the açai pudding for dessert and it was amazing as well. ,I will definitely come back as the atmosphere had a cool vibe and the staff was fun."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/9/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,I have been here twice and both times food was delicious and the service was excellent. On my first visit I had the the steak with a side of seeet potatoe fries and vegan capraccio and it all tasted great. This time around I ordered the signature burger with no bun and it was mouth watering. The point of the review is that you can't really go wrong with anything you devide to order. I hope as the word spreads and they get busier they can remain consistent with food quality and service.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/4/2016,$$,4,Organic Bites,"Ordered out for a staff lunch and we were all very impressed. Suggested by a vegan coworker, this place had more options than one would assume. I had the Reuben and added grilled onions. By far one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The atmosphere of this place is definitely a weekend favorite. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would for sure recommend this place to anyone looking for some different good eats."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/10/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,Burger was good and the ambiance was chill mainly outside. I did hate the fact there's no regular fries just sweet potato fries which I don't like. I know I'm prolly the only person earth that doesn't eat sweet potato fries but I just cannot get into them. Besides that there's nothing special about this place. Supposedly it serves organic foods. It is a great place for vegans because my friends bean vegan burger tasted actually better than my beef burger.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/23/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,"I heard about this place from a good friend of mine. She mentioned that the food was amazing. With much anticipation I visited the restaurant, it was cute and all however, there weren't many protein alternative options for vegans like myself.  They did have a vvegan burger which came with goat cheese so that wasn't very helpful. The service was aaaaaah just ok. A bit of a wait, yet there weren't many people in the restaurant. I asked for a macha tea with almond milk and I got just that a tall cup of warm milk with a teabag floating in it. That part still makes me giggle when I think of it. Long story short. I won't be putting this place on my list is frequently visited restaurants"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/22/2018,$$,5,Organic Bites,"This place is really good and everything on the menu looks awesome! What we did try was amazing! Everything tastes fresh, and the service is excellent. (They don't have many gluten free options which is a bummer, and not too many vegan options either.) Hopefully they get some Kombucha because that would be nice with the meal (instead of lemonade or soda) I would come back again to try more dishes and I would definitely recommend for a nice breakfast or lunch!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/12/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,Love the variety of food here. Many vegan options. You definitely need to pop over to Chef Chloe for the best ending to your meal. I love that the food hall has a vegan option at almost every vendor. It's awesome to be able to grab a delicious refreshing smoothie and head out to the terrace for a nice swing. Enjoy!
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I really love the concept of this higher end food court with healthy varieties! There's Italian, different types of Asian foods, vegan foods, smoothies and bowls, and a coffee bar just to name a few. I ordered the Ramen and honestly...not good. Avoid that. Bland and way overpriced for what it tasted like. BUT try the Avocado Salad from Chloe's and you'll LOVE it. There's a bar at the center for cocktails and wine and you can get drinks from the different markets. Definitely go with friends, grab drinks, and enjoy!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Really good has about 12 vendors of food . Tacos , vegan cafe ( which was amazing) and Asian food . The have char grilled oysters at another place . My favorite was the vegan cafe (the vegan nachos are amazing ) as wells as the large delicious guacamole salad . Def a must try"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This is an open market with many small food vendors and a bar in the middle. This spot was an awesome experience with friendly chefs rolling fresh pasta, excellent vegan desserts, and yummy cocktails made by friendly bartenders. I would definitely recommend stopping here for a bite while shopping in the awesome boutiques in the area."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I'm so glad more food halls are opening in Miami! St. Roch Market (apparently pronounced ""Rock"") is a great addition to Miami's growing roster of food halls. I checked it out this morning after learning about it on Chef Chloe Coscarelli's instagram, where she announced that she will have her own all-vegan stall in the market. , ,The place definitely fits within the Design District. It's a clean open space above Estefan Kitchen with a range of stalls - from asian and italian to coffee and smoothies. , ,I tried a basic açaí bowl from SweetBlendz and was a bit disappointed when I saw that the açaí puree was pre-made - but that quickly changed once I tried a bite and realized how yummy the puree actually is. I'd definitely recommend getting a bowl. It's topped with all kinds of fruit and is a decent size to fill you up. , ,One caveat to the whole place - everything's pretty pricey. My açaí bowl was about $12. A quick browse of the rest of the shops showed similarly high prices. I'll have to try more to see if the prices are worth it! Definitely looking forward to testing Chef Chloe's vegan goodies!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Excellent new spot in the Miami Design District with great options for a variety of cravings. Tacos? Chicken rice? Vegan cupcakes and matcha soft serve? You got it! Also, working on a random day and having some coffee to enjoy the ambiance is a great idea at St. Roch Market. ,Highly recommend the hummus from Jaffa, the peanut butter cookie from Chloe and the coffee from Sabal, of course!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/28/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Came over to St. Roch Market last night with a friend for dinner. I was instantly impressed with the decor and the variety of options it had to offer. From Meditteranean, Italian, Mexican, Vegan and more--with so many options it was hard to choose!,I ended up grabbing some tacos with my friend at the station called Hot Lime. I tried the short rib taco and the pork taco ($10 for two tacos or $14 for three). Absolutely delicious and satisfying! The guac ($9) we ordered as a side was made fresh but I personally didn't feel like the price tag matched the taste. Still good and would definitely recommend trying Hot Lime out.,We later had vegan dessert at Chole which was absolutely delicious! Whatever you do, please order the Strawberry Chocolate Cupcake. Soooo good! It may be vegan but it tastes just like chocolate. Could've fooled me.,On to the service at St. Roch Market...,The only reason I deducted one star was that of the service employees. My friend and I arrive around 7:45 PM on a Tuesday evening, it was not busy whatsoever. However, the bussers kept hovering over us to clean up our plates. We were asked SIX times (in a span of 15-20 mins) if they could remove our plates (which we were nowhere near done) simply because we were talking and enjoying our conversation. We finally gave up and left because of the pushy bussers. Honestly, this was my main complaint. No one wants to be rushed during dinner.,Overall, minus the pushy and annoying bussers, I'd come back to grab a bite soon!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"My crew (my wifey and sister-in-law) and I decided to try the new St. Roch Market in the Miami Design District. It's been open for about a month and it's a nice addition to the district. Its on the second floor of the shopping area and parking is very easy. There's valet or a self park garage. Let me tell you a little about the layout -- it's a food hall. There's about 10 food stands and they all have menus to pick from. There's seafood, chicken and waffles at a stand called ""Coop"". Ramen noodle soup at ""yuzu"". tacos  , chips and fresh made guacamole at ""hot lime"".  There also vegan  options in almost every stand. One of the details I did notice was that the staff working the tables and cleaning were very nice and doing an excellent job keeping the area clean. That's always a plus and The prices were reasonable. ,St. Roch Market is a nice addition to the Miami Design District. I recommend you try it for a afternoon or dinner."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/29/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Okay Eat! By Chloe is the best thing to happen to Miami! I love Vegan food and vegan options and this place has everything you want, but better! I tried the sprinkle cupcake and it tastes like heaven with sprinkles on it! Chocolatey deliciousness! Then the vegan nachos were AMAZING! I'd definitely share next time but also probably not because I ate all of them anyway! They were sweet but also salty and the toppings were perfect. Then the dragonfruit drink was so sour and sweet and perfect for a hot summer day. I wish I can eat here everyday ... maybe I will."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Great little food hall with lots of vegan options!!! My boyfriend and I got the spicy tofu banh mi sandwich  at Tran An and the vegan ramen at Yuzu. The sandwich was pretty good (pretty small for the price) but the ramen was to DIE FOR. ,It had tons of wonderful veggies and mushrooms, lots of flavor, and was a huge portion! Pro tip: ask them to split one order into two bowls for you. It's great to share! It was by far the best vegan ramen I've ever had. ,We would've gotten some desserts at Chef Chloe's place but it was late and they had sold out by the time we finished eating dinner. Their treats looked and smelled delicious though! ,Highly recommend this place for great vegan options!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/20/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"St.Roch was our final stop during our Miami trip! I love Chef Chloe and saw on her Instagram that she had opened up a cafe at this new market. Obviously I had told my fiancé that I wanted to check out this place well before we even got to Miami! Lucky for me he made sure we ended our trip with brunch at St.Roch Market. His friends who live in Miami hadn't heard of this food hall yet (I deff felt like an insider lol). St. Roch Market is part of a newly developed high end shopping center. It is modern, has a variety of food vendors (Israeli, sushi, Mexican, Vietnamese, vegan desserts, full bar, coffee shop, Italian, acai bowls/juice shop etc), AND tons of seating! We also saw a birthday party going on- so that's something to keep in mind if you need a place to celebrate.Their eyes almost popped out of their heads as they walked around trying to decide what to eat! I opted for a falafel platter from the Israeli vendor (Jaffa). The food was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully presented! For dessert I obviously went to Chef Chloe's cafe and got a chocolate chip sea salt cookie- chewy, perfect sweet/salty balance & ginormous chips atop the cookie (total win!) The guys tried the sushi, bhan mi sandwich, sushi, Mexican corn, the shawarma platter, and coffee. Everyone loved their food and they can't wait to bring their friends/S.O  #yourwelcome #thanksinstagram"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/4/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So excited about this new food market in the design district! Plenty of ethnic food options for a price that's relatively affordable, especially when considering the design district location! Exciting to have exciting new food options in this food hall, instead of common chains that I'm used to seeing around Miami. Hard to decide between all of the food vendors, especially since all had vegetarian and vegan friendly options. Will be back to try out more!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"I loved this place since I found out about it 3 months ago. It's great to have several different options so everyone in the group is happy, wherever your vegan or a total carnivore like me. I've tried 3 of the places already, and loved the Vietnamese food particularly, but can't wait to try everything since I haven't been disappointed yet. It's great to have both seating outside and inside with beautiful hammock/chairs under canopy of vines."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/2/2018,$$,3,St. Roch Market,"Looks like the food market idea is becoming more popular now. It's a great concept since there's a variety for all taste buds! I ordered ""Yuzu's"" Vegan noodle bowl and it was tasty, good size, but way too pricey. I paid $19, and felt it was a bit absurd for ramens.  My boyfriend had ""Hot Lime"" which is the Mexican Taco spot... he loved it! He had the chicken, the shortie taco with beef short rib, and the vegan taco which were amazing, but they were too small, gone in 2 bites. But we'll definitely be back for the tacos and to try different spots."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So much better than I was expecting! The quality of everything was excellent and so much variety! This is the perfect spot to go to if you're with a group.. there is something for everyone! Oyster bar, juice/smoothie bowl bar, hummus bar, asian fusion, Italian, tacos/ceviche, Vietnamese, vegan bakery, southern soul food.. all top quality."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Today was my second time here. Chef Chloe's place is ok... now there's only one savory option and it's the truffle avocado toast. How creative. Before there was a few other things and they were worth the visit, but now those are out. The vegan desserts have been on the dry side, none of them mind blowing. ,However, pretty much all the other vendors have amazing vegan options. Jaffa has plenty of Mediterranean plates and dairy free ice cream flavors. Don't miss out on this place. Healthy food with lots of flavor. ,The Japanese place has vegan sushi rolls which were delicious. ,Happy hour at the bar is great too."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/19/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"So far I've tried a banh mi from Tran An, sushi roll from Itamae, ramen from Yuzu, açaí bowl from Sweetblendz, and desserts and nachos from Chole and the Vegan Cafe. Everything was good, but the only place that really stood out to me was Chole and the Vegan Cafe.,Which also made me realize, this food hall is relatively vegan friendly. There's the obvious Chloe and the Vegan Cafe whose desserts have me thinking about them days later. But also, Yuzu makes a vegan ramen. I'm still on the hunt for a satisfying bowl of ramen in Miami, but the one at Yuzu is not bad (they'll even split it into two bowls if you want to share a few different things with a friend!).,If you're deciding between food halls, I prefer 1-800 Lucky in Wynwood or even Jackson Hall in the Health District. But St. Roch Market definitely fills a niche of its own in the bougie Miami Design District."
"12055 SW 117th Ave, Miami, FL 33186",1/5/2017,$$,4,Hole In The Wall,"I've had good experiences at this restaurant sports bar every time I've visited. In the past, I've come here with big groups of people, and they were always accommodating and the service was always great. I honestly can't recall the menu or what I had ordered too well, but since it's a sports bar the vegan options are probably limited. But they do have a good selection of drinks, I remember ordering some good beer last time I visited. It's a fun place to go with a group since sports bars tend to be louder and more tolerant of big groups, understandably. I remember the restaurant being a moderate sized, not too big but spacious enough. I had a good time here in the past, and I will definitely be coming back here with friends next time I visit the arcade next door."
"1071 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/25/2017,$,4,Firito Taco,"Totally unexpected treat! The tacos are very fresh, and you can see the cook prepping everything with love. The bahn mi tacos were good and the short rib quesadilla was even better. I also tried the vegan and the Jorochito. ,Everything was good, i'd definitely go back."
"1071 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/29/2017,$,5,Firito Taco,"My favorite taco spot in Miami..& my boyfriend is Mexican so I'm dealing with high standards lol. We LOVE LOVE LOVE. Vegan tacos are delicious btw. ,The place has a small selection of items on the menu but it keeps with the charm of the place & trust me you'll never get tired of them. ,I don't eat meat or dairy or gluten..a know..BUT this place is the perfect choice for those of us who still want to indulge with our love ones in a 'regular' way.,Try it!!!

"3235 NW 32nd Ave, Miami, FL 33142",3/13/2018,$$,5,Taqueria Los Dos Amigos 2,"This is a review I was reluctant to write. I didn't want to write it because this is a hidden jewel, and if I write about it, it won't be hidden anymore. I'll tell how I found this gem. I was selling a piece of restaurant equipment that the owner purchased, but prior to the purchase I asked the owner what was his intention for the equipment because I used it in my house. He tells me it's for his Mexican restaurant. I tell him great I love mexican food and where is his restaurant. So after the purchase he gives me the address and I tell him I'll visit one day, Thank you and good night. Well one day was the very next day. Now on to the food. The fresh made guacamole was delicious with the homemade tortillas chips to start. Next I'm vegan so I had the Spanish rice with beans and sliced avocados which was equally just as delicious and to wash it down a Mexican Pina soda, lastly the prices are on point. The food was so good I went back the next day. I didn't post any pictures, you'll have to go and see for yourself. maybe I'll be able to keep it a hidden gem."
"40 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33132",3/28/2018,$$,5,Notso Tokyo,Great food and great service! AND multiple VEGAN options. Yes please! The decor is great with old school video games and anime as the theme. They have arcade games to play for FREE. I would definitely recommend this place! My favorite option on the menu so far was the ginger kissed salad. Looking forward to tying the curry next time!
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/10/2016,$,5,Diced,This restaurant had great food.  Everything was very fresh. Lots of options were available for those that are vegan or vegetarian.  They didn't have a line during lunch hour.
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",8/30/2016,$,5,Diced,"What a wonderful little Gem! I had a delicious chicken bowl with quinoa and all the trimmings. Had it with their signature sauce that includes 3 types of sauces including guava...omg, I couldn't stop eating. All veggies were fresh and place is very clean. They even have vegan option choices. Totally recommend it to anyone that would want a tasty and healthy meal!"
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",5/11/2016,$,5,Diced,"Found out about this little spot at a bootcamp event that they were kind enough to be a part of for autism awareness. They pride themselves in serving healthy food so I didn't feel guilty eating this after an intense workout. The man who was serving the food recommended a vegan sauce he had just created a couple of days before, along with a guava sauce -they were both DIVINE. They were nice enough to give me seconds since the portions were really small & also provided me with a shirt of theirs. I went to the actual restaurant a couple of days later & was welcomed in by the same guy who had recommended the sauces. The staff was very attentive & the food was even better the second time around. Will deff be going back soon."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/3/2017,$,5,Diced,"Food was great, healthy and with vegan options. The service was also great.   My husband and I both had a steak bowl to our liking. It was fast and not expensive option for dinner. The only down fall we had was when we walked in the restaurant smelled like cigarettes.  Almost lost my appetite.  It seemed like maybe the staff took a quick cigarette break inside near the corner..... it's a small restaurant so the smell travels.   Luckily it didn't linger and the food and service made up for it.   Would definitely come back again ....!!!!  Minus the cigarette smell......."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",9/15/2017,$,5,Diced,Honestly such a great place and it's vegan friendly! Their staff is very friendly and work pretty fast. The place is always packed and my order is always made quickly and all of their dressings have a vegan option.
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",6/24/2017,$,5,Diced,Had the bowl with chicken and it was delicious  I will make sure to come back. They have vegan choices!
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/15/2018,$,5,Diced,"We have been hearing about this place for some time and we thought why not go one day, this is now our top place to go eat lunch every now and then. Not only is it healthy but it's sooo filling and I love that ! You can ask for extra at no cost. They also have vegan options which is great !! They have never failed me. The bowls are deep so it maybe seem like little but it really isn't. This is definitely my to go place for fast healthy food."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",7/16/2017,$,5,Diced,"Where has Diced been all my life? The diced staff was amazing, they are very lively and upbeat. I'm a vegetarian and the menu had great vegetable selections. I got the vegetable bowl, with brown rice and all the toppings, including avocados. The next thing they ask you is which sauce, and let me tell you all the sauces are amazing. I love that they had vegan sauces as well. I got all 3 sauces on top of my bowl.  The spicy guava is my favorite.The portion sizes are very well, I could not finish my bowl but my friend did. We both left extremely satisfied with all the fresh toppings and filling bowl. Would recommend this place as they are a very healthy fast food option. And I confess... I couldn't leave without buying the sauces to take home...lol"
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",10/4/2017,$,4,Diced,"This place is perfect if you are on the go and need something fast but healthy.  It reminded me a little of chipotle in that the menu is simple.  You just pick your protein, the add-ins and the sauce.  The sauces are the best part and they also have vegan sauces to choose from!"
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",12/6/2013,$$,3,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I really don't understand the hype with this spot, aside from the beautiful setting. We went for breakfast on a Sunday and ordered the garden omelette, homemade bread, coffee, and juice. The omelette had zero flavor- and we eat tons of vegetarian and vegan foods to know that vegetables don't have to be bland. The bread tasted like something you can buy pre-made at the grocery store, but it was made better by the delicious jam they served it with. On the upside it really does feel like you're sitting in a garden and it smells so good of plants and flowers. Our server was quick and friendly so no complaints there, either. I haven't hit up too many other spots in the Grove but there are much better places in Coral Gables for breakfast and brunch."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",2/15/2015,$$,4,Peacock Garden Bistro,"Food quality and allergy/gluten/lifestyle (vegetarian/vegan) friendly menu: 2.20 stars. Service: .80 star (close to 1 full star). Atmosphere: 1 full star (in fact, I might even in throw another .25 star, for the outdoor seating on a beautiful Miami day is priceless). My recommendations would be: for the price, I'd like to see this restaurant offer some higher quality foods (i.e. wild, free range, grassfed, organic) and beef up your the gluten sensitive, and add some vegan options. Overall great spot, in a great location, with some very tasty cuisine."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",3/28/2014,$$,4,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I was here for a wedding reception, so we were treated very well.  We didn't get the full menu of options since I'm sure the bride and groom had to choose a pre-made package, which unfortunately didn't include any vegan or even vegetarian options.  However, since our orders were also taken at the table (not just via our RSVP), I was able to get the corn soup appetizer (they claimed it had no chicken/beef/etc broth) and vegan risotto as my main meal.,The corn soup was absolutely delicious; it was a good level of sweet: not too subtle but not overbearing, either.  The only thing bad about it was the dish it came in was basically a plate (not completely flat, of course, but shallow), so there was much less soup than expected.,The vegan risotto unfortunately was topped with grated cheese, but I was able to skim that off to the side.  I'd only had a bite or two of risotto before this and didn't recall whether I'd liked it or not, but this one was pretty decent.  It had some veggies mixed in, but the one I remember is the mushrooms (I love mushrooms!).,I'd prefer that they would have had a larger vegan selection (I'm pretty sure their full menu has more option that could at least be modded to be vegan, so this might have simply been due to restrictions on the pre-made party package).  However, the risotto at least showed they'd put effort into it.,We started out at the cocktail bar, which had some couches and single lounge chairs, as well as a piano.  It was a bit crowded with our party, but it seemed to have some flair.,The room in which we sat for dinner was very large and full of round tables for party guests, and there was also some space for dancing by the DJ.  There was a small upper level with large windows that went unused, but the windows allowed in some sunshine.,Parking was available in a garage underneath the restaurant.  Unfortunately, the garage is cash only, but there is an ATM right next to the garage entrance (which you should visit *before* exiting).  I believe it was around $5-10 for the 3-4 hours we were there, but you'll want to double-check.,There was some street parking, as well, but I'm not sure what the rates were, and I wouldn't count on finding a free spot, depending on when you go.  There was another parking garage about two blocks away; again, not sure the  rates.,Lastly, there definitely was some eye candy among the staff (not that that's reason alone to go!)."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",8/7/2018,$,4,Diced,"Love this place! Went for my first time and the food was amazing. It's great that they have veggie options for vegetarians or vegans while also having meat options. The pinto beans were amazing, and I loved their garlic cilantro sauce as well."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",7/17/2018,$,5,Diced,"I. Love. This. Place. Sometimes I will get food here 3 days in a row, no shame. I love that they have options that cater to my dietary restrictions (dairy-free). I love their vegan tomato basil sauce and their vegan pesto cilantro sauce as well. The more the merrier! They are fresh, quick, and tasty. Definitely recommend :)"
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",4/23/2018,$$,5,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I went to Peacock Garden Cafe several times for lunch/dinner while I was looking at wedding venues in the area. The service and food was so great, I choose to have our rehearsal dinner here. I'm so glad I did. All of my guests loved the food. The chef was also accommodating to my guests who were vegan/vegetarian. We had our own private area for the rehearsal dinner and designated server. I also considered them to be reasonably priced for full experience we got."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",7/3/2018,$$,5,Peacock Garden Bistro,"This is the second time I've worked with the Peacock Garden Cafe for a company luncheon - and Ismelda and her staff always deliver!  The large banquet room is perfect for hosting a party for 65-80 people. The staff were very pleasant and helpful as we set up the room an hour in advance of the banquet.  The wait staff constantly worked the room to ensure drinks were filled for the 2 hours we were there. There are several lunch packages that will satisfy meat, fish and vegan eaters and although basic (potatoes, salads, etc) they create the  most savory side offerings. Deliciously seasoned chicken breasts and salmon filets that are not overcooked are not the easiest dishes to master on two buffet lines,  but the chef in the kitchen managed to pull it off without a hitch. Both were moist and flavorful and again, deliciously seasoned.  The most notable side dish of all, which received rave reviews across the board is their ""creamed spinach"" dish.  Truly freshly made with real heavy cream and whole leaves of spinach kept disappearing off the plates and into people's mouths. It was not surprising to hear people say ""I'm going back for seconds!""  Key lime pie and brownie sundae were the perfect dessert to end a very satisfying meal. Overall, If you're looking for a venue that can accommodate a large crowd and that specializes in delicious home style cooking flavors and substance, the Peacock is a great choice (and this is not a paid review!)."
"2001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",9/18/2016,$$,5,The Daily Creative Food,"I lived around the corner from this place for six years, and I'm just NOW writing the five-star review that it deserves! It's super busy (as always), but they never fail to accommodate my dietary restrictions. I got the Lifeguard wrap and veganized it by substituting the egg whites for grilled tofu and eliminated the Swiss. It was super flavorful and I highly recommend it! Also, the staff made a special almond milk frozen mocha (with Ghirardelli chocolate--yum!), which should definitely make its way on the menu. In the neighborhood? Come here for brunch. It's a must!"
"2001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/29/2017,$$,5,The Daily Creative Food,"Excellent customer service for picky vegans! Great staff & manager :) I had the asian wrap with no chicken, carrot ginger soup, and green tea freeze with almond milk - all very yummy!"
"350 NW 8th Ave, Miami, FL 33128",11/26/2017,$$,4,Miami River Cafe,"Vegetarian and Vegan options found here ,Homemade tortillas always steal my heart, and theirs are on point. Delicious!,Homemade salsas and beans. Elotes (street fair corn on the cob) are a must and Margaritas were also so good at only $4 bucks. Chill atmosphere with Latin music playing, which is always a plus, in my opinion ;). Thumbs up and be back, for sure!"
"6900 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/6/2015,$$,3,Via Verdi Miami,The only thing that does not involved cheese here are salads!! Very limiting menu fro vegetarians an vegans. The ambiance is good and red wine bynthe glass too
"6900 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/29/2016,$$,5,Via Verdi Miami,"Nice vegan options and a green outdoor patio. I arrived late on a weekday night and they were very kind to offer a delicious vegan kale salad with apples, walnuts and a mustard vinaigrette along with the yummy chickpea dip served with sliced cherry tomatoes and Italian  crisp bread.,The interior resembles a movie set from Goodfellas or the Godfather - a place that you may overhear someone murmuring  about the whole cannoli or where they stashed the loot.,The patio is really nice surrounded by vines which buffer the noise from Biscayne Blvd and they have a cute gourmet food shop with homemade sauces. Viva Verde!"
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/2/2016,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"One of the best meals I have had in months. This was a spectacular dining experience! Every dish was beautifully prepared and presented.  The flavors, presentation and variety in the menu satisfied our party of diverse eaters. I eat vegetarian and vegan and there were many options and everyone loved them. The ricotta, figs, beets was outstanding, the cauliflower, pumpkin gnocchi incredible with a balanced wine list and a great value. Its worth stopping in to try if you are in Miami."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/2/2018,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"What a great place to bring a large group of people too. We were eight people and we sat in this large booth. The cocktails were amazing and there was a variety of food options for all the dietary restrictions in the family (vegan, among them). The service was also very great. I find that sometimes big groups get ignored, but our waitress was very attentive."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/28/2017,$$,3,Beaker & Gray,"I feel like this place could be so much better if they catered to others who have specific dietary needs. Out of all of the food that was available in the menu, I found it really lacked in terms of vegan and vegetarian options. I was only able to eat one thing out of the entire menu that had well over 20 things and I found that to be disappointing.  On top of that, the place was ridiculously overpriced for food that wasn't quite filling. ,I highly recommend that if you want to come here, you come purely for their drinks as that seemed to be the only thing that I really enjoyed out of this entire experience. ,Also, even though our server was willingly trying to be attentive to my dietary needs, he still ended up messing up my order for when I asked for specific things to be taken out of one of the things in the menu that I ordered. This was the cauliflower that came with bacon and the fact that not even that tasked could be done, made me reluctant to ever return. ,You'd think that this place would be more up and coming and cater to everyone as it's Wynwood but it wasn't. ,However, my mom and my boyfriend enjoyed their meals and I really liked the ambience of the place since it brought something romantic so it's great if you have the money to spend on an expensive date or a place to go with family that came from out of town."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/26/2016,$$,5,The Spillover,Vegan crab cakes!!!!! Delicious!!!! Guava cake and tres leches desert is amazing. They even have a dog menu. I love it!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/18/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,This place was great! Great service and the food was amazing. The vegan crab cake was so tasty. Highly recommended.
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Love cauliflower buffalo, vegan crab cakes, awesome kombucha. Hidden gem. My favorite in coconut grove."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",5/1/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Great restaurant!! I was wowed when I first went, and when I went again! The Vegan Crab Cakes had me at first taste. And the Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer, ooof. The service is great, the vibe is great, and yep, so is the food. You definitely want to go here at least once. Your tummy deserves it. :)"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/25/2016,$$,4,The Spillover,"Came here based on reviews before realizing it was mainly seafood. I opted for vegan crab cakes which were basically over-seasoned veggie patties, and too spicy to enjoy. Others in my party had the lamb burger which was ok and the lobster Reuben which seemed to be a hit. Would have given this 3 stars but beer selection is great, service was fair, and decor was creative. Definitely worth a try."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/23/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Lovely ambience and excellent service. The music takes one back to various eras so if you're open to oldies and jazz like music then this place is a no brainer. I had the vegan crab cake with a side of cauliflower mash and an appetizer of fried conch, both orders were extremely tasteful. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafoods or drinks."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/27/2017,$$,3,The Spillover,"My carnivorous family loved their meal, but unfortunately I am a vegan. Oddly enough, the only vegan sandwich option used honey in the sauce and in the making of the bread. While I am sure the bread and sauce were delicious I do not eat honey and felt mislead by browsing the menu online before trying this place. However, the waitress was very helpful and lovely."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,Yum! The vegan crab cake sandwich is my favorite. Throw in some sweet potatoes fries and it's a home run. Try the ciders they are refreshing!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/2/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"So many good options on the menu. Before I went vegan I tried the buffalo cauliflower (appetizer), pan con minuta, the burger and deserts. None of it disappointed. Passed by today and had the vegan crab cakes, they were pretty satisfying! Our server was great as always. Check this place out."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/9/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Another fabulous eatery from the Lokal restaurant group. Although I don't quite get the theme of the spillover, the food did not disappoint! I enjoyed a savory vegan ""crab cake"" sandwich with a side of grilled mushrooms. I also tried the gator BBQ ribs which were also great. ,The guava bread pudding really hit the spot with guava marmalade oozing out of it. ,I'll definitely return to try more dishes."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/20/2018,$$,4,The Spillover,"Great happy hour with good food and great beer. Lovely to sit outside with our pooches. The vegan burger is so delicious. As were the buffalo cauliflower and snapper bites. Austin, our waiter, was very attentive. I've come a few times and this was the best experience so far. This is not a ""fancy"" place with ""fancy"" food. Just good stuff excited well for a good price. Can't beat that..."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/25/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Really great restaurant!! I went with my family a few weeks ago and celebrated my birthday and we were all really impressed. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather that evening. There's an amazing selection of ciders, beers, and mead to choose from. My mom, who never drinks, found a nice Swedish pear cider that she really liked. My family shared the fish dip as an appetizer and all had high praises. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and absolutely loved it!! The menu also said there were more vegan and gluten free options available for those with dietary restrictions. We finished the meal with some guava bread pudding and chocolate cake which the family really enjoyed. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in coconut grove!"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2018,$$,3,The Spillover,"The restaurant has a lot of cool and funky decorations that give it a very unique feel. Spillover is a seafood restaurant that also has a wide variety of other menu options, and even some exotic options such as gator ribs. In addition they also offer vegan, and also dog friendly menu options. I came here a couple of weeks ago and ordered the jambalaya, while it was flavorful the sausage and chicken were quite dry, and there was barely any shrimp in the giant portion. While it was tasty the quality of the meat was quite disappointing. However, the bread that it came with was very delicious, and the meal was plated very beautiful. One warning is that they will charge you a dollar for water since they use a fancy filter to filter it. Based on the other great reviews my experience here may have possibly been a fluke, and The Spillover may be worth trying again."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/22/2018,$$,5,The Spillover,"Such an amazing place! Small/medium intimate space that seems like a gem of a find. Decided to try it based off yelp reviews & thankfully, I was not disappointed. I ordered the veggie pasta and shrimp. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a great one. Such a light, healthy feeling meal but still fulfilling. Even the simple toast on the side complimented the sauce of the pasta. Would definitely recommend, plus they have vegetarian and vegan options."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/31/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Came here with the bf for a Friday night date and we had a great time! We got there around 7:30 and there was a wait so we decided to sit at the bar. Vanessa was a super great bartender and server. She took great care of us and gave us enough attention without making us feel constantly watched. The buffalo cauliflower was really yummy and a great appetizer. We also were  treated to the fish dip due to a delay in our food. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but the bf liked it ok. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and I loved it! Great flavors and texture and the 50/50 fries go perfectly with it. My bf ordered the lobster reuben and claims it's ""his most favorite sandwich ever"" so we will definitely be coming back again! Overall I had a really nice meal and can't wait to come back to try out more of the menu!"
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/7/2011,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,"A very trendy and new age type place! This place could please even the pickiest of eaters with their wide array of dishes anywhere from simple lunch burgers to complex vessels of fresh ingredients. Vegetarians, meat lovers and even vegans will have some big decisions to make on dishes to try. TRUST ME, coming from someone who knows that restaurant in and out; it is a wonderful place to be. There are many regulars who will attest to that! Make sure to make a reservation if you're coming on Thursday, Friday or Saturday and especially if you have a party of five or more. Brunch on Saturday and Sunday contains the Canes' classics with some additional breakfast items. They are more than accommodating for large parties as well with a pre-fix menu they can help you arrange. The happy hour is a STEAL~amazing fresh drinks that taste as if you're getting your daily fruit value with a buzz! I recommend ordering for the table during your first experience so everyone gets a taste and can decide for themselves what they prefer. The staff at sugarcane are extremely knowledgeable and well prepared! If you find yourself to be an indecisive person, simply give you're server an idea of what intrigues you and they can make a phenomenal experience of dishes for you! Overall, this place is a Miami encounter you must have! AND, do not leave without trying the french toast desert even if only for a bite ;)"
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/2/2012,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,Wow! Sometimes through complete dumb luck you luck out. It was my husbands bday. We had tix to a Heat game and wanted to have dinner in Miami before driving home to Boca. The Miami boat show was going on and it was Presidants Day weekend. I was striking out on all places in SoBe. So via Opentable I found Sugarcane. The reviews were good but I was clueless. It is in a very cool new area called Midtown Miami. I am from Atlanta and this area is reminiscent of Atl. The restaurant is very  Cuban old world looking. The big drawback is the very small tables and chairs. Neither my hubby or me are big at all but it was uncomfortable. We had excellent cocktails and wine. They have a menu of about 50 rums. Some are very small batch and hard to find.  Nice. We enjoyed 6 small plates. The plates were so delicious and the selection was extensive. I am vegan and my hubby is meat all the way. We were able to have it all! Please give this place a try you will not be sorry. We will definitely go back
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/2/2018,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,"Every experience i have had at Sugarcane was a pleasure! The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxing and sophisticated! I have a specific vegan lifestyle i like to follow and the manager Marcelo went out of his way to give me options! He was also very friendly and inviting! He also was very accommodating when i showed up for my birthday with a friend! Highly recommend Sugarcane and the management/servers excelled my expectations! 5 stars all the way"
"3404 North Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/7/2014,$$,4,Prohibition Restaurant and Speakeasy,"Pros: Great food, service, and scene. Mix of new world and old world music. Good mix of people. Great place to grab drinks with friends and order a bunch of small plates to share. I am vegan and even though the menu is not vegan friendly, they were able to accommodate me, which was greatly appreciated. ,Cons: On the smaller side. Gets loud for conversation. Single bathroom."
"3404 North Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/19/2015,$$,4,Prohibition Restaurant and Speakeasy,I took my boyfriend here in July for his birthday. I like restaurants with a little noise and full of energy and this was it. We were late for our reservations but they added us back on the list. It was a much longer wait and when we got seated it was at a bar type counter with stools right in front of the kitchen. It was nice with the man playing the saxaphone. The food was good and nice portions for the appetizers. I had pita with hummus and guacamole with plantain chips to share. Being vegan that was pretty much my meal because it was so filling. After we ate we went upstairs where they played music with a small dance floor. It was not my style they DJ played Spanish music the entire time. It would have been nice to have a mix of current music that is why I deducted a star.
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2016,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,"Delicious, fresh and simple yet flavorful dishes. Had the vegan risotto, organic carrots out of this world ! Service was very good. Limited wine selection by the glass. But good choices for draft beers. Will definitely be back."
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/13/2016,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,"Excellent food and amazing service in a fun,casual setting. Outstanding octopus and loved the vegan cauliflower soup. Ceviche was very well-balanced instead of the very acidic style at many restaurants. Definitely will come back to this place soon!"
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/23/2017,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,knew their vegan stuff and my non-vegan friends completely feasted! Wonderful place for everyone to dine :)
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2018,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,Bohemian meets neighbourhood joint meets young and sassy.  I ordered the impossible vegan burger and it was impressive in look and taste.  My mom had the pulled pork sandwich and she responded favourably to it.  This is not a normal menu item by the way.  Service here is friendly but I found it to be a bit inconsistent.  Ice tea is good but not to be charging $4.50 for it.  The restaurant has limited inside only seating so always a good idea to get a table reservation before arriving.  There is some parking around the building but it is rather limited as well.  All in all it lives up to the 4 star and higher rating for a casual restaurant and any place that plays Pass the Dutchie is alright in my book.
"210 NE 18th St, Miami, FL 33132",8/5/2015,$$$,4,Mignonette,"Extensive menu focusing on seafood. They had 8 different types oysters to choose from. We opted for the chefs choice and they were excellent. The red fish was excellent as well for my main course. Although a seafood dominated menu, they were able to accommodate our vegan friend with the vegetable platter. Service was good, not great."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2015,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Two girlfriends took me to my favorite restaurant, Michael's Genuine, yesterday for my birthday. Lunch was fabulous!  We ordered hominy and falafel to snack on, yum. One is vegan and enjoyed the falafel wrap. Me and the other shared the butter lettuce salad with grilled steak and a bottle of Sauvignon blanc. For dessert we devoured the pot de cream, and Rosemary doughnuts. WOW, ROSEMARY DOUGHNUTS!!!!! Incredible. Can't wait to go go back :)"
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/14/2013,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"I have been waiting to dine at Michael's for quite some time now, so we stopped in for a drink at the bar, the dinner menu would have proved tough for two vegans.  ,After propping ourselves up on the chairs, we ordered the Cabarete and Ginger-Lemongrass Homemade Soda, and the bartender went straight to work. Both were deliciously well-crafted, and we started feeling a bit of envy that we were unable to stay for dinner, or, all night for that matter. Sigh. ,The over-all experience seemed much more expensive than the bill actually was, and the atmosphere, was indescribably un-Miami, Miami. ,For a few minutes we feel transported else where, then, the parking meter ran out."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2016,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Went here this morning. Sunday breakfast. Open earlier than most restaurants in the area. Very unique menu, absolutely delicious food. Everyone loved everything, but very small portions which the waiter did tell us from the get-go. Also, I do wish there were a few more vegetarian or vegan options. With such a creative and unique menu, I'm sure they can come up with something. I will be back though."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/18/2018,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,Been coming here for years.  Always wonderful.  The staff is so helpful and nice.  They are always accommodating for vegan dishes.  Great atmosphere.  I don't attempt brunch anymore because it is so packed.  But I love coming for an early dinner.
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",9/13/2015,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Hidden Gem! T&T is literally tucked away in a housing complex in Kendall. It has a hip Wynwood feel with affordable and delicious mexican fare. Vegan and Vegetarian options are available. Service is fantastic! It actually feels like the entire staff has stock in this place. They personally want you to have a wonderful experience. I predict another location opening in the near future.
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/12/2015,$$,3,Tacos & Tattoos,"Vegan customer here with a tip for management:,Tell the chef that the tofu and mushrooms need more seasoning, and that the portion sizes are ridiculously scanty. ,That being said, the service is phenomenal and the decor is super hip. ,Hip is a great word to describe this place."
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/30/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Just recently went vegan and the tofu tacos here are BOMB ! They're my go to order and they're very accommodating to my dietary needs ! The restaurant itself is very nice the ambiance is somewhat underground and hipster. The staff is so friendly I can't really say enough nice things about their waiters and how friendly they are I will definitely be going back for more tofu tacos !
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",12/10/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"Great music, amazing atmosphere, extensive menu, vegan and veggie friendly, can bring the kiddies and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more! Did I mention a lotta bang for your buck?"
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",5/5/2018,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"A cool little spot in Kendall.The food tastes fresh and you can tell there are experienced people or a chef is involved in the kitchen. There is a nice kick that I enjoy in almost everything, so beware if you are of a sensitive palate. Their fresh salsa is one of my absolute favorites. Used to visit more frequently before going Vegan, wish they had more plant based options, and or specific veggie items on their menu. Other than that, my entire family loves this place and it is a staple for our dinner celebrations."
"270 Biscayne Blvd Way, Miami, FL 33131",12/28/2013,$$$$,4,Zuma,"Came here around 6:15 and got seated within a couple of minute. Really nicely decorated inside. I am vegan and I love mushrooms but the items with mushroom in them had butter so I had to request it grilled sans the butter and they did just that. I got the Mushroom salad which was $15. I guess that is an ok price because usually mushroom dishes are more pricey. I also got the Eggplant robata which had this velvety texture almost like fish. It was really tasty. The only downside to the restaurant that I can spot would be that we came at 6:15pm and they told us we have the table until 8pm but the service felt very like rushed. The waiter seemed to want to take our order and just get it in as well as the other staff. Also, the dishes were not huge, I did not happen to be too hungry so I was satisfied but on a regular day I would probably order another vegetable from the robata list."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/20/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"GreenStreet Cafe is a good crowd pleaser. They've got something for everyone, even someone who is vegan and gluten-free. There are enough items on the menu for a vegan who is also sans gluten not to feel too boxed in by limited options. We went for breakfast so this will color this review. The potatoes are fried in peanut oil so they're 'safe', The generous fruit plate and melon plates are also a good choice. The tomato, grits, oatmeal with cranberries or raisins and museli to the same tune were also lovely. They didn't have soy milk for the coffee (they normally do and their soy lattes are AMAZING!) but the coffee was still great. Omnivore friends said their eggs were ""perfect"". The omelete also seemed to please.The service was fast which is typical. We didn't have to wait for a table of 4 which per past experience is a little unusual. Everything was clean and done simply but well. I wouldn't go for myself but it's a good restaurant for groups with mixed dietary needs."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/10/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"I am in a hard place. Wahhh! This place was good but quite pricy. I wanna give 3/5 stars because of the pricing, but I think that's silly of me because touristy areas are not going to be cheeeeeap :3 I'macheapladymeep! ANYWAY, the food makes it worth a 4/5. I love that they give you some sort of spicy baresque peanut mixture before you get your food. Yum! Swallow that stuff up! I ordered a veggie pizza that was vegan (cheeseless :D) without having to ask. The hostess asked me!!! (Do you want cheese? Nay!) I was glad to have that option. ^.^ It was a really good sized pizza! Nice place... open late... yay & yay! : )"
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",8/15/2014,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The best choice for a Grove sidewalk seat, we love this place.  Our cheerful server, Justin, was more than helpful with vegan modifications.  Fig salad - no cheese - perfect balance of flavors, not overdone.  As always, it was AWESOME."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,We love Greenstreet! We come here every weekend for brunch. It's dog friendly and the food is great. We came here today to celebrate a birthday and we had the best time. Our server Andre was phenomenal. Always ready with a drink or menu recommendation and his quick wit. Both vegans and meat lovers were happy. Come see for yourself!
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/11/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"I always enjoyed this place before becoming vegan. Since going back, I really enjoyed their oatmeal (one of the best I've had). I had side of the potatoes, which have always been my favorite!! And a bowl of fruit, which were all fresh and delicious. If you're vegan, I wouldn't worry too much. They have more of a selection than other places and it's good quality."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The vibe is very intimate and cozy. The server was very attentive. My sister is a raw vegan and asked for a salad with a side of avocados but when she started eating the salad she noticed it had feta cheese. The server (Ricky, I think his name was) replace the salad right away with and gave her another side of avocados with no charge. He recommended the Penne Tetrazzini and it was delicious! I finally tried the Nutella filled French toast that I always see on Instagram and one word, AMAZING! ,Everything was great, next time I'll definitely come around to try their brunch!"
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",8/25/2015,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wow! This place is awesome. I came for a birthday dinner with my girls. Each of us with some weird eating habit. 1 vegan, 1 gluten free, and 1 allergic to fish. This place was able to cater to ALL 3. This is what we all ordered and loved it!!!!! Vegan - Fried corn with no butter; portobello mushroom sandwich with extra chips and avocado, and lychee sangria. Gluten Free - Lemonade, baked bbq chicken with veggies. No Fish - BBQ Pork Burritos, sangria and key lime pie. We were stuffed and so happy. BUT, the best part was our waiter KIAH!!! Once he heard about our weird habits, he confirmed with the chef at the start of the meal what we could all eat. And if he didn't know then we made sure to find out. He was so funny and personable. He didn't try to pretend to know the menu, he really knew it and would ask questions if he didn't. We didn't feel neglected or bombarded. If you have a chance then take a seat with KIAH!!! I will definitely come back"
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",5/9/2016,$$,4,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Delicious comfort food, without the pretentiousness of many restaurants of this level. My compliments to the chef, who made every effort to accommodate my daughter's newly adopted vegan lifestyle. The service was good, actually really good. We were a party of 10, and everything came out at a reasonable time. This place is always packed, and worth the wait. The pan roasted Brussels sprouts are amazing with that green goddess dressing. Don't miss the fried green tomatoes and the fried chicken."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",7/9/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Away from the beaten path yet accessible from Sunset Drive and Red Road quietly sits Whisk Gourmet Good and Catering in South Miami. Fun restaurant with reasonable prices (not ""gourmet"" prices). First we were greeted by a warm woman whose smile was contagious, handing us a bowl with 2 homemade lemon poppy muffins (freshly made, moist, not too sweet which is a biggie for me and a hint of lemon, perfect), our server was a friendly gentleman who was always mindful without being intrusive. Our food was spectacular AND Frank X. Pulles had his favorite,  Low Country Shrimp and Gritts. Coffee was beyond exceptional and the OJ tasted fresh squeezed.  Yum. Starting TONIGHT I go back to my Vegan foods, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",11/1/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wowwww. The salads here are to die for. Such fresh and clean food. Felt so healthy. They have a lot of gluten and vegan free options which is good. The fried green tomato was just perfect. The salad portions were decent. The creamy corn was actually my favorite. I thought everything at this place was great. The service was good, and the waiters were nice. Definitely recommend"
"90 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",12/17/2014,$$,5,Vero,"We are so happy to find this restaurant in our area. The owners are so friendly and accommodating. The chef is obviously passionate about his food and when we brought friends who are vegans, his dishes were creatively thought out and well executed. Paula at front of house is the perfect compliment to this establishment with her personality and friendliness. Quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in Miami."
"90 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",3/15/2017,$$,5,Vero,Great food and great service. The waitress offered vegan options which was nice. Only problem really was that it was in a sketchy location.
"1731 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",3/14/2017,$$,3,Lung Yai Thai Tapas,"I was in the neighborhood looking for Asian restaurants, I read the reviews stating that they had vegetarian options so I stopped in. It is a small thai open kitchen with counter seating and a smaller adjacent dining area. I was greeted promptly by a lovely thai server. I told her I was interested in vegetarian options and I was sadly disappointed. Every entree has fish sauce in it so I opted for the spring rolls and crispy mushrooms. The food was good but I really wanted AUTHENTIC Thai food, not ""snacks"".  I would have given this 5 stars but not having many vegan/vegetarian options is why I'm giving 3. I recommend going here if you eat meat. Also they will not seat you until your whole party is there, so get there together and be prepared to wait."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/22/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere and open kitchen. Service was great too. We had a rice pot (vegetarian not vegan) and it was delicious and big. It was packed on a Thursday for lunch, so best get reservation."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/4/2014,$$,4,Kush,"The selection of beer here is excellent, the staff is very knowledgable and go out of their way to make sure I have a great experience. The food, however is lacking in vegetarian/vegan options. All I can really eat there is the black bean burger, which is delicious, but I'd like to have more of a variety. I know they have a veggie meatball dish but the tomato soup they put it in is NOT veggie friendly. I made the mistake of ordering it and then being told they put beef broth in it. Whoever is in charge of that....vegetarians/vegans will not eat it because it has BEEF BROTH and meat eaters won't eat it because it doesn't have MEAT....think about it. ,Anyway, I definitely recommend this place to any beer aficionado or someone who enjoys some delicious treats. The cooks know what they're doing but PLEASE get more veggie options. I promise you will have more guests coming in."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Great hangover spot or great place to get a hangover! Excellent burgers and conch salad and the fries....to die for. A friend usually gets the vegan option and now they have salads but that isn't what I go there to eat.  They also make homemade honey mustard which is perfect to dip the fries in. The space is small so expect to wait or sit really close to others...Beer options are great, lots of local options and they always have a revolving selection too so ask your server what they recommend. I've never been disappointed with their choices."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2016,$$,5,Kush,"I found this restaurant here on Yelp. We chose this restaurant first because of the location as we were taking photos with all the colorful walls wynwood has to offer. Second I am vegan so I always try to find a place that has some options for me as well as my meat eating friends. Third the ratings and reviews for this place are amazing, and i now know why. This resultant was not fancy but it was welcoming and fun.. Lots of beer to choose from..The food was over the top amazing. I got the black bean burger and sweet potato fries I had no complaints it was so good.. Others in the party had hamburgers and the gator tacos. The hamburgers, I'm told were cooked to perfection and the tacos were the best ever. I will recommend this place from now on and will definitely  be visiting again."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/2/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Friendly fast working staff and very knowledgable about the menu and beers they had on draft. So excited to Come back to cool environment. A must see place, the vibe is dope and so is the staff. The food was impeccable. I'm vegan and Sonnie my server was very accommodating. What a blast and good time Stephanie the bartender was as well. I'm not only really into food I also happen to be from newyork so having that attentive confident service was a A+ for me. Try there homemade hot sauce its the taste your craving. Literally writing this review on the way there again. See you there yelpers"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Their Vegan Jambalaya was spicy and all sorts of good!!!!  I would go there every day for that Jambalaya.  The free parking after 4 is extremely helpful too.  Went during a weekday, so the wait was not bad at all."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/29/2016,$$,3,Kush,"Sister was visiting home and chose to go here. We were a large party and they accommodated us quickly outside. They are known for their beer selection, but I didn't have any. I highly recommend the alligator bites... delicious! We also ordered the vegan jambalaya and the chicken and waffles. The jambalaya had a nice kick to it. I also tried the frita burger and it was yummy. Overall a good experience."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2015,$$,5,Kush,"Just a small jaunt from Wynwood areas, my friend and I hiked here during after seeing some amazing grafitti. Her, being a vegan, makes it a little more challenging to find a good food spot. Often times, servers won't know what vegan even means and would add or bring dairy. She called ahead to ask about a few specifics on the menu before our journey to a very helpful person. We arrived to a busy and smaller restuarant, our first good sign of what was to come! ( also appeared to be filled with hipsters mixed with business attire- clues to a good local spot! ) We sat on perimeter bar top. The decor, very urban sheik yet casual. Grafitti/ street art theme throughout. The had a nice selection of draft beers to start. The waitress was immediately pleasant and recognized/ made mention of my girlfriends call earlier. I decided on a burger, The Rita. Gueyre cheese, bacon, potato sticks and guava jelly on a perfectly cooked Patty. My mouth died and went to heaven! Yum. Loved the ""Kush"" burned into my bun top. My girlfriend did the black bean burger with guacamole and was equally  impressed. Just writing this I wanna go back! Try this place! It's great... You might have to squeeze in cause its busy, but for good reason!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/28/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Such a spot! Cozy, friendly, fast service, awesome varieties of food and beer. If you are around, visit it. Also good for vegans. Ask for Jambalaya. Freaking awesome taste. Portion is right enough if you not super starving but local IPA will complicate it. ,Seasoning of food is crazy, spicy, rich on flavor... real comfort vegan food. No bs and sprouts. Quality is way better compare to other vegan places."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,3,Kush,"Meh. Impressive beer selection, and I liked the sour brown I had, but food and service left a lot to be desired. I'm vegan, and I made that pretty clear when I asked about the challah bun, but then the lettuce-wrapped veggie burger came out with cheese, and our appetizer didn't come out at all. Server was totally nice, just busy and thus inattentive. ,The thing I liked most about the place was the bathroom door (see photo) and the fat that Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was playing on the TV."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2014,$$,5,Kush,"I'd recommend the Johnny Utah, but I'm dying to get several other menu items. It's easily vegan friendly. Sides are all flavorful- asparagus is my favorite. There will absolutely be a beer on draft you'll love. ,They have quality... And variety of quality. ,It's always busy now, but worth it. Large portions, decent prices. First come first serve at the bar. A few picnic benches outside."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/31/2017,$$,5,Kush,"The vegan jambalaya is a revelation. Seriously, vegans and non-vegans alike will absolutely love it. Perfect flavor, just the right amount of spice and fills you up! Service is great and so is the ambiance. Definitely visiting Kush again anytime I'm in the Wynwood area!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/26/2017,$$,4,Kush,"Let's start with the positive..so last time my bf and I came here it was delicious we both left in heaven! This time, there was about a 45 minute wait and we were told to go 3 doors down to the right; there was a separate waiting room with games and drinks. As we enter, the vibe in this waiting room is cool, so we play Jenga. About 35 minutes later, we are seated and immediately order the Guac and chips! App came out super fast! Then for entree I ordered the vegan jambalaya and my bf ordered a burger; I didn't like my jambalaya..maybe it is because I don't eat meat and the texture was weird or there was too much? But my other half really enjoyed his burger. Dessert was excellent though, we had the jon dough with no ice cream. The manager went above and beyond to check and make sure the dessert was vegan and helped me out so much! Overall, we will be back, I just won't get that item. The food comes out really fast which is a plus! Also, everyone was really nice to us!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,As a vegan and going to a beer and Burger joint of course my choice is very limited but there is something for me.  I've ended up there many times with fiends and they love it and what if it was enjoyable. The beers are great and always come out satisfied
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/23/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Kush. We come here Wednesday night, after work,  two hours before closing, just lookin for some grub. We order: black bean burger and the vegan jambalaya, no drinks, just water. Service was great, food was great, and it wasn't too hot outside. Also highlight of our meal was when Blister in The Sun came on. What really bugged me and is making me write this review is what happened after we paid... ,Tipping is important. This is something I know well, because I'm also a server. I had a pretty great experience tonight, in fact, all of my experiences at kush have been great, but the attitude I received tonight made me super uncomfortable. I didn't have much cash on me, I had just enough to pay the bill, and a couple cents to tip. I had 3 measly dollars left in the bank and I thought to myself, well why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?,So I did it. ,waitress comes back to pick up receipts and change and walks away with a bitter look, TURNS AROUND to ask if there was something wrong with service to which we replied ""no"", and we looked really confused and shook and she actually looked down at the change, questioning it again and just walked away leaving us staring at each other in disbelief. Honestly just felt like such a degrading experience. She made us feel really bad about ourselves. I felt very judged and I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible to avoid the awkwardness she had created. A tip is a tip, right? we tried."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/30/2017,$$,5,Kush,Always great service and food. Have been multiple times with my boyfriend and to bring friends from out of town. Always a decent beer selection as well! Not only a place for meat eaters - great selection of vegetarian and vegans options. I always go for the alligator bites which is something cool to share with friends who don't live here. The menu is always changing but can definitely say I haven't had something I didn't like.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/22/2017,$$,5,Kush,"This place is awesome! Me and my husband have been here twice, this first time I ordered a salad and he ordered the chicken and waffles and gator bites! The salad was not a basic salad the lettuce and toppings were grilled and gave it an amazing flavor we both cleaned our plates.. and for Deseret we had the Brownie which was okay, but i wouldn't get it a second time and if I could recommend that they heat the growing up next time bc it was a very basic brownie lol. The second time I got a vegan jumbalya it was to die for!!! Even if you're not vegan you will love it! Even if you hate tofu which I do, you will love it in this dish! And my husband got a burger which he said was delicious. I eat more on the healthy side my husband not so much s going here there was options to satisfy both of us... OH! And the bathroom is define super cool! Check it out lol."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/19/2017,$$,5,Kush,The black bean burger was amazing! We also has the vegan ice cream which is made locally and so creamy and delicious you would never even know it's dairy free. The atmosphere was very laos back with the music choice and that's 70's show playing there was plenty of vibes going on. I'll definitely be returning.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,"As a non meat eater I'm obsessed with their vegan rice and seitan dish- amazing! Service is great, super dog friendly, just wish they had more space because wait times are usually pretty long!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,4,Kush,I'm OBSESSED with the vegan jambalaya....wish they had more vegan options but even so I keep going back for the one dish they make that I can have! Love the beer selections. Cool vibes. Great location.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/2/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Farm to table... Great food, great atmosphere and they have a waiting room. The veggie burger is bar none. No pun intended.. this is a must visit.. veggie/vegan friendly.."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/12/2018,$$,5,Kush,This place is great! They actually had a vegan option on the menu which is rare for Miami! Keep it up!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/8/2017,$$,4,Kush,If you are in Miami this spot is a must ! The dishes are unique and there are plenty of vegan options that taste amazing. I split the burger with egg on a waffle and a vegan chicken parm. Missing a star because the side order of vegetables was very disappointing - only a few pieces of peppers.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/5/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Love everything about Kush, especially how the attentive and genuine wait staff happily suggest ways to make most of their entrees vegan or vegetarian friendly. Every time I've been, I've walked away blissful and full."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/9/2018,$$,5,Kush,Great vegan options!! I had their three vegan taco special and my husband had the vegan jambalaya. Both were fabulous.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/2/2018,$$,5,Kush,Kush has to be one of my favorite spots in Miami  An amazing variety of beer options and the alligator tale app is to die for... if you dont order the alligator bites at Kush you haven't been to Kush! The Chicken and waffles are phenomenal! Let me tell you something about the Frito Pie.... ORDER IT! You won't regret it! If you're that person that's trying to get into the that vegan life.... Kush has great options for you too!!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Whenever I want regular fries and sweet potato fries at the same time, this is the first spot I think of. Best veggie burgers in town and paired with fiddy fiddy fries, you can't go anywhere else for a great burger after that. The vegan jambalaya is my other favorite dish when I'm not in the mood for a burger. Great vegan options, great drinks & great vibe."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Perhaps I wont be able to do this place justice so very important disclaimer: *vegan palate*,So, I have come to this hole in the wall twice now and have gotten the same thing: the vegan cajun dish wish soy chorizo and rice. It sounds and reads amazing but the taste is unbearable! Too spicy! Very hard to eat and finish a dish when your mouth is on fire! If youre going to have a vegan dish perhaps make it edible by most. I know many people like a hard kick to their bite but damn not all people and not that hard. ,I still have hope for Kush and hope they start dishing out more vegan options, thanks for having one in the first place!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/30/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Cute place. Every detail is thought out and tied together perfectly. If you go during the day you can avoid more of the nighttime busyness. Outdoor seating, doggie menu for the fur babies, great service. In the heart of art in wynwood. Check it out, vegan jambalaya is delicious!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/13/2018,$$,5,Kush,"This was definitely the trendiest hole in the wall I have ever been to. Located in a really cool part of town in the art district (Wynwood), this is a spot I will come back to. The place was small, but could hold a good amount of people during a semi busy happy hour. We went for an early dinner, so there was plenty of room for 6 people at a table. I went with a healthy-ish vegetarian option - the vegan jambalaya. After a week of eating everything in sight, I was trying to be good. The dish was good, but I do wish I hadn't tried to be so good. Everyone's burgers looked so amazing. We will be sure to come back and visit the next time we are in town, maybe even check out the other spots by Lokal."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Great food, great service,  fantastic folks. Very knowledgeable about beer selection. Everything on the menu is great including vegan options...psst don't forget to ask about off the menu items;) intimate setting, unique seating arrangement. Next door is the Botanica - room with craft beer for anytime or while you wait. Kush has one of the best CRAFT beer selections around ask my boy Caros at the bar, his recommendations are always on point. ,Chicken and waffles are a must, hobo frito pie and chicken skins are usually first for me. ,Highly recommended local TRUE miami spot."

"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/29/2016,$$$,4,KYU,"From the subtle side salad to the colorful drinks, this place knows FLAVOR. As a vegan, I was able to choose a few items from the menu. It is extremely pricey and the portions are not that big, but the atmosphere is amazing and super trendy. The waiter knew his stuff and was very helpful."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"The ribs will turn a vegan into a carnivore.  Umami to the max.  Crunchy and perfectly cooked, no disgusting gristle bits... divine.  Even typing this review, one day after the meal, I'm salivating. I'm from Manhattan, and I am a bit of a food snob...so you can trust me.  This place is beyond.   You know those crappy wooden popsicle stick chopsticks that make you cringe with horror as they brush against your teeth with every bite?  Not here! The chopsticks match the atmosphere: streamlined, modern, and well designed.  Well worth the price $$$.  The cauliflower is crunchy and has a delicious creamy but light sauce underneath it.  The tomatoes with olive oil have the perfect flavor of the olive oil.  You can taste the quality and the creativity.  Hop on a scooter, or into a fiat, or onto a graffitied car, and get over to KYU as fast as possible."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/30/2017,$$$,5,KYU,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Wynwood! As a vegan, they have tons of veggie options here. There's something for everyone here. I especially love their roasted cauliflower and kale. Mmmmm! I recently organized my cousin's bday dinner there with a large group and the staff was always on top of things."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/25/2018,$$$,5,KYU,Love this place! Make sure to call early to get a reservation but the food is awesomeness. Good vegan options as well for your non meat eaters.
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2012,$$,5,Blue Collar,"Just love this little spot.   Situated in a super seedy motel, this quaint little restaurant has a truck stop/diner feel.    The menu is really vegetarian friendly, and I had heard about all of the fantastic side dishes, so I went vegan for the day.   I had the brussel sprouts, artichokes, beets and the sweet potatoes.   Everything was perfect.   I was so full, and I didn't finish my sweet potatoes.   The chef noticed, and asked if everything was okay -- it was better than okay.  As people walked in, the waitress and the chef recognized everyone -- lots of repeat guests."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/27/2013,$$,5,Blue Collar,Came here while visiting Miami. Heard great things about this place and had to see for myself. Lots of vegan options. Great beer selection. I tried the veal special and LOVED IT!!! Will def return during my next Miami visit.
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/25/2014,$$,5,Blue Collar,"The best comfort food in town, no doubts about it... Also many vegan options for those in low carb diet. My favorite sautéed kale, just delicious..."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/22/2015,$$,5,Blue Collar,"Small and intimate. This is a hipster's place to go. Greeted by Matthew, my server in a tux t-shirt I received the same quality of service I would in an upscale restaurant, if not better. Food? Truly outstanding. In the mood for veggies? Their veggie menu will inspire you to go vegan. The chef Derek Camejo came over to make sure my meal was good and introduce himself. The camaraderie of the small staff was easygoing and authentic. The decor was simple,clean with a touch of artsy vintage. I'd be happy to visit again."

"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/2/2017,$$,3,Blue Collar,"First time here for my girlfriends birthday. I'm vegan and was a bit worried I was not going to be able to enjoy anything. Luckily, they did have a few vegan options in their veggie section, not too many but atleast some. The food was tasty and filling and a pretty good price for the size of the dishes. The service was not all that great. The server could answer all my questions but the bussing was lacking. They really did not bother actually picking up the plates, as we all had to pass our own plates to the busser, and also did not even bother to wipe out table a bit, pour our water or wine. Maybe I was expecting too much but I think if I was really hungry and around the area I would come back."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/23/2017,$$,5,Blue Collar,"I love Blue Collar! I am in no way a vegan or a vegetarian, but all I ever get here is the veggie platter.,This time I got the roasted beets, the collard greens with bacon, the mashed yukon golds, and the sautéed mushrooms. I tried to save half of the plate to bring home, but I ate it all! ,I have brought many friends who all enjoy eating here."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2015,$$,3,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"They should add a few vegan options. They do have some vegetarian though. However, they were very accommodating and ""veganized"" their dishes."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/3/2016,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,Simply amazing and right next to Wynwood Walls. This is a must see place! I'm a vegan and they had a lot of options. My favorite was the flash fried bok choy! My husband is a meat eater and said the 48 hour pork belly was the best pork he's ever eaten
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"Regardless of what cuisine you're into - meat lovers to vegans - this place has it all. I've never had a dish that isn't excellent. It's too good! Excellent service, conveniently located next to the Walls."
"1035 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33136",6/12/2018,$$,5,Fooq’s,Beautiful rustic French restaurant. A small shop that can allows everyone to be a little bit more intimate. Service was great the waitress really knew her stuff. Food came out in a timely manner. Wine list has depth to it (I mean it's a French restaurant) I ordered a vegan entree I believe it's called seasonal vegetable tahdig and my girlfriend ordered the Fooq's burger very flavorful. Overall great wait to end the night.

I looked at the menu options, & advised our server, Luis, that I was vegan. Although there weren't many vegan options, Luis advised the chef to personally make a special dish for me. He came out with a delicious quinoa salad (not the one on the menu). Luis was very courteous and very attentive to my needs (I'm also allergic to avocadoes), I will definitely visit CAY more often for brunch! Thank you Luis! (-:"

"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",10/9/2017,$$,4,Cocowhip,"Yummy vegan froyo. Hailing all the way from Australia, this chain found its way to Brickell and I'm glad it did. I liked their original and chocolate flavors, so I was really excited when they said they'd be rotating the chocolate out the next week for matcha. But after coming back a few times and it was still chocolate, I lost faith and the post-run habit (probably for the better though considering one bowl will easily set you back $10). Also considering its location inside an eatery with 100 Montaditos (Spanish tapas place) and Kai (poke and ceviche place), it's a convenient dessert spot to treat yourself every now and then."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",12/10/2016,$$,3,Cocowhip,"Located inside the 100 montaditos, cocowhip is a small yogurt option with about six topping options. Although its a little steep in pricing. We paid $18 for two yogurts with about 2 toppings each. The yogurts are vegan so they melt quickly. The consistency isn't as thick as you'd expect. ,The nice part is that there is outdoor seating, bench style and high tops. They also have flat screens tvs; you can watch your sports game. Parking is hard to come by, I parked in the garage at the building next door on se 12 terr."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",6/8/2018,$$,4,Cocowhip,Update - went again to find out the carrot cake isn't  vegan as was previously told on countless occasions. Very disappointing and irresponsible of the staff. I didn't give a low rating because the staff member who went in the back to ensure it was not when we asked him for the vegan carrot cake was very apologetic when he found out we use to buy the carrot cake because one of the staff told us it was vegan. He offered us a free vegan banana muffin as an apology. Also the cocowhip is still very good and highly recommend it.
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",9/15/2017,$$,3,Cocowhip,"We came here with a friend - after giving into our late night cravings - not realizing it was a vegan, gluten and dairy free kind of place. According to their menu CocoWhip is made with Coconut Water, Organic Bio-Fermented Coconut Powder & Vegetable Sourced stabilizers. There's five CocoWhip variants: Original Coconut, Cacao Bliss, Super Berry, Minty Matcha, African Mango & Turmeric. The Original CocoWhip (their most popular) is more on the neutral side but I added some fudgy brownie bites. If brownies is not your thing they do have a few additional toppings and syrups to choose from. CocoWhip has a very light coco taste (which will go well with any of their toppings), texture was also light, not creamy and had no consistency related to pudding or yogurt. I thought it was quite refreshing. I would like to try their Cacao next time but as for their service, it was very slow. Price wise it was steep (about $6) considering the small size of the cup. My order was made on the spot but my friend ordered the Acai bowl (she did not like the texture) which took about 15 minutes to make! I am willing to give this place another go if I happen to be near-by. Just keep in mind that aside from their soft serve there's not a lot of other dessert choices. And I do agree with a fellow Yelper that my dessert also looked nowhere near what they advertise on their social media. CocoWhip is inside a small section of another restaurant. You have indoor seating and there's also a cute and well lit outdoor seating area. Luckily for us the weather outside was perfect that evening. Too bad my friend didn't enjoy her dessert but I sure enjoyed mine. Hope they're faster with their service next time."

"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",8/2/2015,$$,3,Yard House,"Came to Yard House for lunch on Thursday. Yard House is a favorite of my office because of the large assortment of food, as well as a very vegetarian and vegan friendly menu. I meanwhile ordered the steak sandwich medium rare and it was absolutely delicious. I enjoy Yard House because of the ambience and the food, but my issue is always the prices. As much as I would like to give it a better review, everything on the menu is just too over priced. That goes double for drinks. Perhaps it is an inflated ego, but I truly believe that Yard House is not a nice enough restaurant to charge the prices they do."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",1/8/2015,$$,4,Yard House,"I actually have mixed feelings about this place. Food is good, but not fabulous... they do have vegan/vegetarianoptions tho. And of course a large variety of beer on tap. But the service is a bit slow, even on days when it's not busy in there."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/30/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"Today I had lunch at yard house Miami beach. Recently, (few months ago) I went vegan and stopped eating all meats and dairy products. I was very disciplined with this until a few weeks ago I started missing being able to dine out without having to ask for an alternative menu. Because I know the dangers of a lot of red meat and hormone in chicken and turkey, I've incorporated only sea food to my diet. ,Yard house offers a rice bowl with chicken and assorted vegetable. I was totally craving this today minus the chicken. I spoke with my waitress who spoke to the manager and switched the protein in my dish for shrimp. I was able to eat what I wanted without the guilt of eating something I knew my body would not be able to handle. It was delicious! Their drinks are also very tasteful. I'm into all sweet and fruity drinks so if I could recommend any I would say have the ""bikini Tini""!  This is a combination of Malibu, banana liquor, pineapple juice and pomegranate. Simply delicious ! ,Oh and needless to say this place is super affordable !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",11/26/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"I've never had a vegan dish like the Gardein Orange Peel ""chicken"" at Yard House. I've been there a total of three times now, I always get the same thing and every time it gets better. I wish it was closer to me but that also saves me money. The waiters do their best and always keep an eye out for you too. I can't wait to try their new vegan burger next time! Yard House has something for everyone!"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/29/2017,$$,5,Yard House,One of the best restaurants in Coral Gables. Many vegetarian and Vegan options. The restaurant gets super packed so make sure you make a reservation. Food is very nice quality.
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/9/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Our server Jade enhanced our experience with great knowledge on the menu and a pleasant attitude. She checked on us just the right amount of times, she knew plenty of information on our vegan and vegetarian options, and she was check ready and did not have to go print the check because she already had it with her. I used to work at Bahama Breeze which is a disaster compared to this Yard house! My favorite part is how much variety they have in their Gardein vegetarian menu and how easy it was to make those plates vegan. Being a vegan is difficult sometimes because most restaurants usually cater to vegetarians. I will definitely be coming back here again for any special occasions so that I can enjoy a good vegan plate."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/15/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Let me start off by saying, WHY have I not been here before! Food, service, atmosphere, everything was amazing! So I came here because as a new vegan I've been wanting to check out places that offer vegan dishes but also offer meat for my boyfriend. I am so glad, I decided to come here. VEGAN burger was absolutely amazing with a kale Caesar salad to die for. Kat, our server was so great and was able to recommend things for me and help me out with the menu. My boyfriend has the Lamb burger, and he loved it (beware of the spicy jalapeño sauce). I loved it and we will definitely be back! ,Thanks KAT !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",5/28/2017,$$,4,Yard House,"Excellent lunch choice as a destination or as a break while shopping at the mall or post workout from the local gym. Loved that there's a gardein section for vegetarian and vegan friendly palettes. Got the guacamole, the poke nachos, the gardein vegan burger, and the gardein bbq chicken pizza. Luckily the place was quiet (just opened for lunch) when we arrived. The staff was attentive and prompt. All the dishes were amazing. Sat indoors which was dark but  comfortable. Outdoor seating is also available. Kitchen and staff are doing a very good job with creating flavorful dishes and an overall nice experience."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",9/19/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"5 STARS FOR MIAMI'S BEST KEPT SECRET VEGAN SPOT,They offer a solid vegan menu featuring Gardein and Daiya products, and the servers have always been willing to double check and verify whether certain items are vegan and whether others can be made vegan. As long time vegans, this is our go to restaurant, and we've never been disappointed."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",3/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"We love this place.  They have Vegan options that are Yummy, a wide range of Beer and a full bar.  The service is always excellent and the price is very reasonable for the location and ambiance."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I like yard house because they have a vegetarian section of the menu that uses gardein products. Most of these options can be made vegan really easily- I've never had a server who couldn't help me make a nice meal. I usually get fried ""chicken"" wings with fries. Not healthy at all but the place also has over 100 beers on tap, and it's a sports bar, so I'm going all out anyways. The chips and guac come with cheese sprinkled on top- so make sure to ask for no cheese if you're vegan. They also have the option of fries, truffle fries (has cheese), or sweet potato fries with most meals."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/20/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I'm vegan //// got an awesome vegan blackened Gardein chicken avocado sandwich. You have to ask for it without mayo and cheese but it's pretty yummy. ,The Gardein chicken is really convincing! Even my non-vegan friends liked it."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/10/2018,$,4,Spice N Curry,"Spice N Curry is an Indian Grocery Store that also serves cooked Indian food from its small cafe in the back.. but from the looks of it, you wouldn't know that they serve food. The cooked food is the reason I've been coming here for the last few years. It's located in one of my favorite strip malls that also includes Vegan & Juice and Chinese Guy.,The food here is very tasty and authentic and the portions are generous. They have a small menu which includes items such as samosas, naan, and some other items that I have been offered as samples. The server here is friendly and always willing to conversate. My favorite entree is their Goat Biryani which is large enough for 2 meals.,The other day I discovered some fresh squeezed Indian bitter-melon juice in a green bottle in their fridge for only $5.99.. another reason to come here. The best way to describe this is nature's medicine and it's said to fight cancer, treat diabetes, regulate blood sugar, and treat a host of other common and/or serious conditions. All I know is that it's super healthy, but most people won't like the taste.. it tastes fine to me. You just take a shot of it each day (and don't overdo it because too much of anything can be bad for you) and the bottle lasts for about a week."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/6/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"I am a huge Indian food fan and Spice and Curry is awesome! They have a small cafeteria in the back of a grocery store and about 12 people can fit on their counters and wait to be fed deliciousness. Their meal combos range from $7 to $9, and i normally get their vegan option. I leave w leftovers all the time. Do yourself a favor and visit this hidden gem!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/28/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"A plus plus all around!! I'm recently vegan and this place offered such a good variety of flavor - all in one dish! I ordered the vegan curry and was surprised at how much food I was given (I couldn't even finish, so I took some home). The meal includes rice and a salsa on the rice, two lentils, naan, and another hard bread (sorry I'm not too familiar with the food names) and a drink, all for $8! This is definitely another hidden gem in Miami. Side note - the home made vegan turmeric cookies are amazing too!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/10/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,I'm so glad my boyfriend took me to this restaurant. I had the vegan curry and for $8 I had one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had in my life. It comes with plenty of food and different flavors. The naan bread from here is so delicious as well!
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/7/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"Great food! I had the Chicken Curry meal that was very filling. My girlfriend had the vegan cauliflower and potato curry.

"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",4/22/2014,$$,3,Pincho Factory,"Came to Pincho Factory for lunch only to experience they were having maintenance issues and would be opening two hours after scheduled time. I was bummed about it and just headed over to Sarussi that is located on the same shopping strip. After lunch and on my way to the car, we notice Pincho Factory is indeed open so we head in at least for dessert. The minute we walked in, I smelled burger juice...like the grease. Maybe it's because my husband is vegan and I've been turned off of meat a little but no lie the smell did slightly gross me out. ,For dessert, there were two options- an Oreo Pie and a Nutella Smore's Pie and they are provided by Sweetness Bake Shop. By the sounds of it, the Nutella would have been my choice but I'm glad we got one of each because the Oreo ended up being the better of the two. Although it didn't blow me away, it was alright- It must have been tucked away in the coldest part of the fridge cause it was a little hard and mega cold on my teeth. ,Hoping I can come back to Pincho Factory soon to update my rating and actually judge them by their own food and not that of their bakeshop."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",9/19/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"5 stars for their vegan toston burger!!! This is not the mediocre, frozen veggie patty I'm used to from non vegan burger joints. It's made from scratch and is SO perfect sandwiched between two tostons."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",3/30/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"This is a place that surprised me. A pincho is meat on a stick so I originally expected just that. Secondly I expected typical greasy, bland tasting fast food. The kind that requires mayo, mustard and ketchup for moisture and taste. But I was delighted to find great flavors and interesting meals. This is fast food taken to the next level. The flavorful level. It's as if someone opened a fast food restaurant but had training at French Cordon Blue. In fact, the only typical ""fast food"" about this place is the furniture. My daughter raves about the burgers especially the toston burger. Which is a feat in itself to make it tasty and to keep it's shape. She licks her fingers every time. There is also a vegan burger that I hear converts people. I am trying all the bowls one by one, having difficulty choosing one. They offer fresco, california, tex-mex, latin, chimichurri, Mediterranean style of bowls, salads and wraps with four choices of delicious proteins. But DO NOT expect anything typical. So far Im favoring the cali because of the mandarins, almonds, gorgonzola cheese and mango sauce.  Omggggg. And the portions are so generous. You will not leave hungry. You can also get hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. Apparently they have award winning fries, and yuppppp: pinchos!!! And a surprisingly great selection of beers and IPAs. I keep telling myself I'm going to get a pincho one day but then I walk in and see the menu and there's just too many great choices. I have a feeling though that they too are probably delicious. The only item I considered just ok were the sweet potato taters. But I am a huge sweet potato lover who believes it should be paired with salt not sweet. And you gotta give them some area to grow. Lol. Also Im always crazy full by the time I get to the taters. So yeah. That."

There are TVs in literally every wall (even in the bathroom), and the place is new, well lit, and clean. They have 2x1 drinks if that's your thing, and a couple of vegan/vegetarian food options on the menu (yay!). The only quibbles are that parking is hard to find, and that the food and service takes a little long."

I enjoy their witty signs they have on the wall and out front. The ingredients are fresh and the menu is all organic healthy stuff, which I love especially the morning after a night out. I always get smoothie #2 with vegan protein added and the avocado toast. Recommend to anyone who likes good tasting food thats also good for you."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/29/2016,$$,5,Aoki Teppanyaki,"I love this place. They have happy hour all day every day except evenings on the weekend. The music they play is great.  Their brussel sprouts, eggplant miso, chicken salad, kimchee pork, sweet corn, triggerfish jerky, firecracker shrimp and aoki slider are all amazing.  They have cool things like chicken hearts and beef tongue too which I am into.  Definitely try the chicken liver!!!! The sushi is fresh, I like their salmon and ikura donburi.  The soft shell crab roll is good. Many items on the menu ate vegetarian and vegan friendly which is awesome.  Honestly I have never even tried their teppan because the individual dishes are so good. The service is also excellent. Everyone is very attentive, dishes are brought out quickly and the management is caring.  This is my go to happy hour spot."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",4/1/2016,$$,3,Aoki Teppanyaki,"The Teppanyaki part of Aoki is awesome 5 star super delicious super reasonable and the chefs are friendly and entertaining.  I've experienced the Teppanyaki twice for lunch and it has not disappointed. They make the BEST mixed rice I've ever had in my life (no kidding). However, I decided to try their Sushi Happy Hour as they advertise some really good deals $5-$7 plates and drinks.  I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi was good, decent but not mind blowing.  Service can sometimes be slow and not streamlined though friendly enough.  Great vegan option is the laughing Buddha roll, no sacrifice in flavor and it's very light. I'm also a big fan of the kama kama (whitefish and salmon  cheeks)."

"5759 Bird Rd, Coral Terrace, FL 33155",10/26/2017,$$,3,Matsuri,"I wanted to try this place since many people say the food is good there. I'll be honest, after reading other reviews, I was expecting rude service. And, I got it. I'm a vegan so I'm used to the rudeness that can sometimes come AFTER I tell a server I'm a vegan. But, at Matsuri, the server was rude from the start, before I even mentioned I was vegan. She looked unhappy and inconvenienced by our presence. We were there for lunch and it wasn't that busy. I waited tables for 18 years and one of the things that servers must always do is be nice and at least act happy, even if they aren't. I asked the server if the tofu dish I wanted was vegan and she said she didn't think so and just stopped at that, didn't offer to check, just said she didn't think so. So, I asked her to ask someone and she visibly looked mad that I asked for confirmation. She came back to the table and told me that it wasn't vegan. So I asked what was vegan on the menu and she said that basically nothing there was vegan(not sure if this is true or not) but suggested I get the boiled vegetables. Um, I'm a vegan, not someone with the flu, I don't want boiled vegetables at a restaurant. So, I ordered edamame and a vegetable sushi roll. She immediately told me that the veggie sushi roll wasn't vegan. I asked why. She said that basically everything there was cooked in fish sauce, and that the rice had fish sauce in the way they cooked it. I gave up. I just had edamame. I was tired of inconveniencing her and asking her questions. Usually places with Asian cuisine are suitable for vegans but not this place! Well, maybe it is, maybe another server could have helped me a bit more. Anyway, my friend liked her Okonomiyaki so much so that she ordered another one to take home for her husband."

"2121 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/30/2016,$$,3,POC American Fusion Buffet & Sushi,"I am pretty wary of buffets - add raw fish to that and I would get SUPER wary.  However, my vegan-self wasn't too worried on this occasion. ,We took a friend's advice and went during the busiest  time on the weekend - this way you know the food is being turned over and replaced often. Wise advice! ,We pretty much stuck to the sushi section and the salad bar. Upon request, they will make you a vegetable roll, which was nice. We managed to eat our fill, but nothing was incredibly overwhelming. ,It is a great bargain tough if you like buffets and random combinations, like waffles with your sushi for brunch :) The ambiance is quite hectic and family oriented on the weekends."

Also very vegetarian friendly, but not so much vegan friendly (I am neither vegan nor vegetarian). Besides that everything was perfect. Overall had an amazing experience and even better food! I definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Food is quite pricey, but most definitely worth it since all the ingredients are from local markets!"

Kendall doesn't have a lot of healthy or ""vegan"" options so I went to Giardino and realized how ridiculously over priced they are for what they offer and left. In my search I came across this awesome place and was impressed by their price, variety, and veggie selection. I will most definitely be returning to this establishment. So grateful that healthier and affordable ""fast food"" options are opening in Kendall."

Got a chicken salad wrap (more flexitarian for today) and it was awesome!! Also got a dancing princess smoothie that is Delish  and I'm really not a smoothie person. Shannon is great! Never stopped working and cleaning the whole time I was here and let me taste a smoothie she was making for someone else and let them taste the one she made for me. Great way to bring us all back for more because both smoothies were pretty awesome.,I'm feeling amazing already  great choice and will become my new go-to for healthy options. Greatly needed around these parts too."
"5829 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",3/3/2017,$$,3,Tacocraft Taqueria & Tequila Bar,The pork taco. Has no flavor. They need a better selection of hot sauce. Need to bring the Diablo or ghost pepper sauce w.e it's called back. It has a good aesthetic. The seats are uncomfortable. Guac is pretty great. Quesadillas are good. The waiters.. ARE ALRIGHT. Maybe the one I got just gave me attitude?? Or was having a bad day?? Idk. W.e the manager is really nice tho. Found a tag of an avocado in my food. That kinda annoyed me for obvious reasons. I've gone a couple times so I'd say it's worth to try. Also had the guac with the crickets so it's unique lol  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options.

For all my vegans or plant based food lovers, Tacocraft cooks up a delicious sweet potato, kale, sautéed onions, and beans taco that is absolutely yummy! If you decide to arrive for Sunday brunch (Unlimited mimosas and sangria ladies!) the vegan taco is not on the brunch menu but you may request it with your waiter.  Great ambience to hang out with friends but be warned it does get busy and seating his limited so early bird gets the worm."

Their tacos are very popular in this area of Miami, and there are vegan and vegetarian options on the menu (there's a tofu taco option!). ,Although I've only been here once, I definitely will be coming back. Good service, friendly servers, delicious food, vegan/vegetarian options, and great margaritas and mojitos. And strong. ;),The best day to come is Tuesday, but I'm sure it's good any day of the week."

"5831 Sunset Dr, Miami, FL 33143",11/17/2017,$$,3,Earth,"I ordered earth for my coworkers and myself for genetic counselor awareness day (we are a genetics department!) I love what earth is doing in providing simple, hassle free, healthy options. One of our physicians is vegan and there were plenty of options available for her as well. I was disappointed because many of the items listed on the menu were unavailable and most of those that were actually delivered were lackluster. The brown soup was bland. The bowls were not very cohesive, and the desserts were not indulgent even when considering the limitations of all vegetable ingredients. Potential to do great things but the items need to be elevated just a little bit. Still glad we didn't order pizza though!"
"45 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",6/21/2015,$$,4,Hibachi Grill & Noodle Bar,They helped me pick out a vegan option. Friendly staff! Definitely am coming again! Right down the street from our hotel. Got a yakisoba with veggies. Bomb!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Recently stopped in here for lunch and the food was delicious! Lots of vegan options and the menu also offers a macro count on each item - so very helpful if you're keto. I got the lemongrass chicken in a collard green wrap and it was one of the best wraps I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/28/2017,$$,5,DIRT,Yum! I'm so happy this opened up in Mary brickell! I have came here every day for the past week and I can't get enough. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade and healthy! I live for the vegan wrap (love the mint) and their tomato soup! I'm super sensitive to sodium but their soup has just the right amount. Portions are huge and the quality is just right for the prices. If you want to only spend $5 go to McDonald's!! Run in and grab a coffee or tea from their coffee bar or walk up and order a healthy organic meal! You won't be disappointed.
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",12/12/2017,$$,3,DIRT,"Love the ambience, healthy food varieties, but wish there were organic options (especially for their eggs). The collard wrap (mai fun vegan wrap) I got was not worth recommending, only part I enjoyed was the sauce. The rest was bland and raw. Don't waste your $5 getting the Adashah as an add on... was advertised as ""amazing"" but honestly more bland than plain polenta. I'll be back to try other things.."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/12/2018,$$,4,DIRT,Decent place with lots of vegan options. Portions are very big. Tomato soup is very yummy :)
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/2/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"They did it again!!!! The food is healthy amazing and has vegan options!  Everything is so yummy!  It's also great because everyone remembers your name and says hello!,My favorites are the dirty vegan salad and the poke Bowl with adashah instead of tuna for vegetarians (although their tuna is high quality and I love it!!!!) and you can't forget the coco chia pudding!!!! I can eat it all day plus if you bring the jar back you get a $1 off the next one!,Today Jeff (an owner who is at the register and greeting guests daily) even offered me to try a new sauce with the adashah (which is an amazing vegan thing to replace meat) it looks and tastes like a filling and yummy cornbread almost... ,I promise you it's the best vegan spot you will ever try and if you're not vegan the rest of the menu plus tuna and chicken are high quality organic with no hormones or anything. The flavors are amazing and it's all made fresh!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/25/2018,$$,4,DIRT,"It's nice having more healthy options in the area. This place is pretty great for the health conscious and is vegan friendly. ,Pros,Great design,Great options,Local food,Great location,Priced similarly for the area. ,Cons,I would skip the coffee bar if you want something high quality. I came for a latte because I saw they had a La Marzocco machine, which is wonderful if you know how to use it. Makes an incredible espresso. Unfortunately the barista didn't have the knowledge to use the machine to its best. I've lived in several coffee cities like Seattle and am use to getting incresibly amazing coffee. So keep in mind you may not care about that if you are usually happy with Starbucks. If you go to Panther or Eternity, you won't find the coffee very good. The bean isn't bad, but it's all for nothing if no one can use the machine well. ,Service-wise, I was a initially surprised that I wasn't offered a new drink, but I didn't mind paying for a new one. The general manager came by eventually and asked if he could remake the drink but it wasn't much better to be honest. Still very foamy milk for a latte that didn't properly blend into the espresso. He also gave me a free Zak the Baker cookie, which was nice and delicious. I would recommend the business invest in barista training with Panther. The coffee bar is a good idea and will be even more worth it if it's the best thing locals can get in the Brickell area."

This is my go to spot now."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",7/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Let's talk about that Impossible Burger. In the wave of plant-based foods here in Miami, this is by far the most delicious and interesting thing I have experienced. Fairly new to the DIRT menu, it's 100% Vegan and mind-warpingly delicious. It's deliciousness, down to a science. At its center is a vegan patty with amazing texture and maybe even better-than-beef taste -- along with fresh spinach, sliced heirloom tomato, and a perfectly sliced and well placed onion (reminiscent of In-Out-Burger). While still experiencing that primal joy that comes with diving your face into a burger, post meal I walked away with a feel-good stomach, a smile, and maybe even a little bit of that chipotle sauce on my cheek. I left wanting another bite... Do yourself a favor, go get your hands all up on its tasty and puffy vegan buns."

"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/29/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Dirt is one of my faves! Dog friendly local restaurant chain with creative healthy cuisine that has plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Also, DIRT offers different meat dishes for the meat lovers! What more could you ask for? ,I first went to DIRT at their original Miami Beach location, and since then I have seen the service and menu improve SIGNIFICANTLY. There are plenty of creative dishes that I haven't even had the chance to try yet, but everything I have ordered from DIRT I have enjoyed. DIRT also provides nutritional info for every dish on their menu (not just calories, but also fat and protein content) so you can make smarter dietary decisions based on your needs. They are very willing and open to accommodations, such as swapping meat or fish for Adashah (a vegan based protein). Adashah is a vegan, nutritious lentil based protein that is made by a local entrepreneur, and it is featured in many of DIRT's dishes. You can even by uncooked adashah from DIRT (sold in their display fridge) so that you can easily cook and customize it at home! I'm a huge fan of adashah, and DIRT is currently the only place I can get it in Brickell (for both cooked and uncooked versions)! ,What I've tried at DIRT Brickell (all were delicious and very filling!) ,Frittata tostada (I got the eggs poached and without sriracha- I can't handle the spice),Clean bowl (subbed turkey bacon for adashah to get a higher protein content, and made the dish vegetarian!),Dirty vegan salad (added adashah for protein) ,Summer poke bowl (sriracha dressing was spicy, so if spicy is hard for you like me, I'd take it off or try something else!) ,Summer adashah plate (surprisingly no customizations for this one!) ,I've also had the açaí bowl here, which wasn't bad, but I'm also picky about these, as I used to work at a smoothie shop that offered marvelous açaí bowls with yummy plenty of different flavors. ,There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at this brickell location. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching in Mary brickell village and has shade. I also really appreciate that DIRT always has complimentary lemon cucumber iced water that is tasty and refreshing! Also, because you order at a counter, you don't have to worry about paying tip at this restaurant!,Dirt has something for everyone, make sure to support your local business and give it a try!"

I think I might just move to India after such a dining experience (or possibly into this place's kitchen). I mean everything hit the spot. I came in hungry and left stuffed off of all vegan dishes with even a box to go. The bismati rice was cooked to perfection and the little fennel candies at the door was icing on the cake. ,It's new so if there's not too many people in the establishment,  don't let that fool you.

My friend's vegan quesadilla came out within 2 minutes. Fastest. service. EVER. Convenient for when you're starving in the middle of rush hour lol I had the ceviche with tostadas, authentic Mexican sandwich, and chips with this yellow corn-bean based spicy dip (phenomenal). ,The Mexican sandwich was whatever. Super thin piece of fried meat that had been covered in too much batter, so you can barely even consider it meat. The bread is thick so the bread to stuffing ratio was unbalanced.  The ceviche and dip was great! My boyfriend got the fish quesadilla, which had with mahi and cheese on whole wheat tortilla. Large portion in width, but could've had more cheese and mahi stuffed in this one though"

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/27/2010,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I Yelped this place when I was visiting Miami last winter. It looks like a hold in the wall, but is definitely worth it, I promise. Once you make it through the health food store, you will find Carlos at the back counter serving up delicious and healthy vegan fare. He takes the time to chat with the customers, and even got to know me a little bit, which is something I truly appreciate. Nothing like a small business in times of evil corporations, am I right? Carlos is good people. He even let me get behind the counter for a Yelp photo :-) He gets his produce locally from what I could tell when I watched him buy some local fruit from a farmer before my eyes. I also watched him juice a freaking watermelon for me, which was amazing. I had the veggie burger and it was fantastic. Now I need to come back to Miami to visit Carlos and try more of his food."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/3/2009,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I love this place. It has been right around the corner from my house forever and I regret never knowing it. It is great for vegetarians or vegans. They have a ton of natural foods and ingredients for cooking as well as a little bar in the back with natural juices, smoothies, and an interesting variety of vegan/vegetarian meals and snacks. They also have some good dressings and sauces for whatever you order, and the owner/manager is happy to help you figure that out."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It was my first time at this adorable vegan place, and I'll definitely be back. I sat down at the counter, and was trying to read my magazine while waiting for my order, and it was clear that the friendly patrons and chefs weren't going to let me eat alone! The entire counter introduced themselves to me, as well as both chefs behind the bar. Everyone was incredibly friendly, and it felt like I had walked into a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other, but obviously welcomed any newcomer. Surprisingly, some of the patrons ate some meat occasionally. Which, somehow, in a weird way, is reassuring.....if occasional meat eaters love this place, so could I. The head chef gave me a sample of the squash soup, that was amazing, sweet, but not overpowering.  I then ordered the garbanzos and brown rice and 2 slices of baked tofu. It was phenomenal, and had so much flavor. The tofu was crispy and seasoned with something that was out of this world - absolutely delicious. The garbanzos were healthy and so fresh. I added this homemade mango hot sauce and I almost licked the plate. The patron to my right gave me the full low down on the place. Aside from their staple salads, sandwiches, and fruit/vegetable drinks, he explained that Chef Carlos has a daily hot vegetarian meal, that changes every day, but that it's the same meal on Mondays, every Tuesday, etc. But Fridays and Saturdays are the wild card. Chef Carlos makes whatever he wants on those days. I'd definitely go back, again and again. ,After my lunch, I did a little shopping, as I try to support small, local, business any time I can. The prices of the items were better than at Whole Foods, and the store staff was very helpful, making sure I found everything OK. I'd definitely support this establishment, and will encourage my friends to do so as well."

The restaurant is in a a strip mall with a vegan restaurant. Dublin Donuts, a liquor store, dry cleaners and a lighting place. The restaurant itself is very small and it has limited seating. They have a huge menu that covers the whole wall as you walk in. I order the tempura JB roll and a California roll (for later). They have a lunch special where you can get 2 appetizers and a drink for an extra $3 with your sushi. I wanted to save my JB roll for when I go home but it looked so good that I ate it in my car. OMG....this is the BEST sushi that I had in a while. The portions are huge and it isn't expensive at all. The service was really nice and the workers were very helpful and friendly. There is parking in the front of the strip mall. ,I will defiantly be back."
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/31/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"I would never fathom that a place called Pincho Factory offered a vegan burger, but lucky for me and other health nuts, it does!  Their bean burger is blended with sweet potato and flour-no eggs here!  It's delicious.  Pair that with their Cajun fries and you got yourself a meal exploding with flavor.,I love their sincere desire to serve customers.  I called to place an order, hesitant as I was certain I wouldn't find anything vegan.  The guy who took my call, Eric, was SUPER affable and courteous.  He described all the ingredients in the burger and even told me to drive safely on my way to pick up my order.  No one has ever wished me a safe drive to pick an order before.  ,My meat-eating colleagues also love this place, so when lunch time comes around, we group up and head over.  I am obsessed with their Cajun fries!  I'll even eat them cold and soggy.  They put caramelized onions on top--yum!,Pincho Factory is quick, affordable, and absolutely delectable!"
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/20/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"Good. Fast food type atmosphere. I'm vegan and I wanted to try the veggie burger but I ended up only trying the Cajun tostones.. the menu didn't have enough description on the menu and I didn't know it would have a non-vegan mayo based sauce on it.,Still tasty though! ,Seems great for meat lovers."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/4/2017,$,5,100 Montaditos,Would highly recommend to locals or tourists. Great value for tasty sandwiches! The patio seating is very nice. And what's great about this location is that there's a vegan / gluten free bakery attached.

"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",4/13/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,Delicious falafel and toppings. Really hit the spot. Cheap too! Vegan options clearly labeled. Employee helping us was very nice and helpful. Street parking only.
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",12/17/2017,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"I was hungry and walking around sunset drive, not wanting to eat the usual thing I eat, when I found this gem of a place! I love falafels, and the way they have the food set up is clean, organized and very delicious! I'm neither vegan nor vegetarian, and this place did not fail to satisfy my very choosy tastebuds. I chose a bowl, and I put all of my favorite veggies and things in it. They have a great variety of sauces to choose from, and I tried ALL of them. I also liked that you can have as much hummus as you'd like, it's included in the price. The fries are amazing too, and the bay leaf powder they put made them taste perfectly seasoned. The service was great as well, they made excellent recommendations and were really friendly. I'm so happy I ran into this place. I will definitely be coming back!"
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",3/31/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"A nice surprise! I was really craving Mediterranean and all the places around work are a bit over priced and nothing out of the ordinary. Decided to give it a try and ordered postmates. I got the falafel bowl for$7 including the (small cart fee) it was delicious. The pickled beets, cauliflower and hummus were delicious. The sauces as well had a nice combination of creamy and spices that I absolutely loved. I didn't think this place was going to be all that but it is vegan paradise! Highly recommend !"
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",10/22/2017,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Hottest new vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurant on the block. Located in the Sunset Place Mall area, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat if you're looking for something healthy and not too expensive. ,The menu is a little small, since they only sell sandwiches, bowls, fries, brownies, and other variations of the sort with different sizes, but it's all very simple and easy to make. ,There is also delivery available, but from what I've heard it's not yet available through the Yelp app, though it's on its way (I think Postmates and Grubhub have it up though). They also don't do call deliveries because they do not take credit card information over the phone, so it's all mobile through the food delivery apps. ,The restaurant itself is clean and comfortably small. I liked the service and my falafel sandwich was made fresh and quick. You can also add on many different toppings without extra fee. My regular falafel sandwich was about $7. ,The peanut sauce is the best! Delicious sauce to put on your meal, I don't know why I only recently discovered it. I also enjoyed the hummus, jalapeño sauce, and red pepper sauce. ,Definitely a new hot spot for all types of foodies in South Miami, accommodating to many dietary needs."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",11/12/2017,$,4,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Looking for a quick bite and Walked into this shop on my way to work. I ordered a Falafel bowl it comes with 5 falafels and you can add any topping as long as it fits the container. The falafels and toppings are tasty, it's an amazing variety of toppings that you see quite a few things that you normally won't seen in other similar shops, such as fried eggplant, pickled cauliflower etc.  Good place to go for vegans, and someone who is looking for a fast service."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",4/1/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Went here for a quick snack before catching a movie at Sunset.  Not only was it so quick to buy but omg it was so fresh!  They had so many vegan options for toppings and you could taste that it was all homemade.,I hope this spot is around for a long time. ,Step in for some delicious falafels with such a variation of toppings that you could really have a whole different meal experience every time.,They serve it in a bowl for those trying to skip the carbs too."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",7/19/2018,$,3,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Came to this vegan falafelshop to catch some lunch before I went to work.  Ordered pick up with postmates.  I noticed the menu was so limited and then realized they really only serve falafel (I know what the place is called just thought they would have more options).  ,I ordered for pick up.  Parking is eh since it is sunset place.  I parked in the garage that was next to where Ra used to be.  I walked to the restaurant which the distance wasn't bad at all.  Just crossing the street can be a bit much with traffic.  Made my way to the place which was easily spotted from the street.  ,I ordered and a lot of the items that I put into my bowl I had no idea what it was going to taste like.  I went on pure gut and prayed it would be good.  Honestly it was.  It tasted great.  The falafel was covered with a lot of sauces and hummus and it never became soft.  The falafel kept its crispiness which was surprising because usually with too much sauce the falafel gets soggy.  Not in this case!,When I arrived I noticed that all the items that I put onto my bowl are nicely arranged like a salad bar at the actual restaurant.  I am pretty sure if I would of dined in my experience would of been much better but since I didn't know what I was getting myself into I was conservative in my order.  My complaint about this place is that there really aren't more options for non vegan eaters however it is great for people who are vegan.  ,I will return to try this place again however I will probably dine in instead of ordering out."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",2/4/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Awesome place!  In search of a vegan option for my,nephew's birthday, I found this place.  I'm not vegan but he is so I needed a compromise. Came here for lunch with my nephew and three kids and it was delicious. Place is small and very casual. Nice decor and clean. You have the option to get the falafel in a pita (white or wheat) or a bowl. We ordered three small pitas, two small bowls, and three large fries. ,At first I was a little concerned because the bowls look small (my kids eat), but we could hardly finish everything. The fries were definitely a lot (we ordered three and took two home), but they were so good. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They sprinkle salt and seasoning if you want. They also have a few different sauces to add to your falafel or fries such as tahini, creamy garlic mayo, curry ketchup, ketchup, and a few others that I can't remember. ,Once your order is ready you can top your sandwich or bowl with numerous toppings that are available. It's self serve so you can add as much as you want, but only once. Meaning you can't start eating your sandwich and decide you want more of a specific topping.  They have quite a selection of toppings which I can't remember them all but some are cucumber and onions, baba ganoush, hummus, pickles, cabbage, chick peas, cabbage, a garlicky parsley thing that was delicious and a bunch others.  Oh and the falafels have a nice delicious flavor.  ,Price was decent...for two small bowls, three small sandwiches, 3 large fries and 5 drinks we spent about $65.00. Definitely would be back."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/8/2012,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,First time here. Very cozy homey feeling. Tried the orange-carrot juice. It was delicious! The guy in the kitchen was very friendly and offered me a free sample of the soup he had just made. Had the vegan sandwich. It doesn't look that big but it's actually quite filling.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/22/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I'm not vegan and this was my first vegan experience.  Soy Empanada, Chicharrones de Tofu, Green Juice, and a delicious highly charged soup that has my energy level on full throttle.   The specials come in after 12:30pm.  Please note they're  moving to Bird Road and SW. 65th Ave."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is amazing!  You could walk by and never even know its there.  The front is a tiny, two aisle grocery store, with vitamins and various vegan and health food items.,In the back there is a small counter where the friendly owner will greet you with samples of whatever he's making that day. When I first walked in he handed me samples of two different types of soup, pasta, and various other dishes.  I ordered the seitan and mushroom pie. AMAZING! It was so good and fresh.  It really had the best flavor and everything in it was cooked to perfection.  I also had the squash soup, which was sweet and creamy and wonderful.  To wash it all down I had a fresh juice- beet, carrot, celery and apple.  Yes, I know this sounds gross, but trust me its not. It is so good for you and the apple pretty much is the dominant flavor.  My sis had ""the rainforest"" which is a fresh juice/smoothie with avocado, banana, and I don't know what else, but it was very good.  ,There isn't a lot of room to sit, only a counter, and two small tables out front.  And the place was packed even though it was a thursday afternoon.  Honestly it is worth it.  I would stand and eat if I had to.  And even though the place was packed we didn't feel rushed by anyone, everyone seemed to be in a great mood.  ,Honestly it was the best eating experience I've had so far in Miami. I would HIGHLY recommend it to vegan and non-vegans alike.  OH did I forget to mention that it was completely vegan? Next time I want to try the apple pie..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/18/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Another Yelp find although I have been familiar with the Beehive for about 25 years, which makes me sound really old but my parents were friends with Bob (owner) and very healthy on top of it.  A lot has changed since then and when I heard about the counter in the back with all vegan homemade food I was game.  Chef Carlos is incredible - I feel like a regular and I have only been once, for take-out! The menu changes daily and you can sample everything before you buy.  I had a lentil soup, empanadas - although they were much more healthy and tasted different than any empanadas I have ever had! I also took a piece of broccoli casserole for lunch the next day.  Everything tasted wonderful (and healthy) and was affordable to boot! Next time I want to find what the delicious looking vegan cakes are since there was a tempting assortment on the counter..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/21/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"We've only tried the juices, so I'm giving the JUICES 5 stars.  Carlos uses unique fresh ingredients that you normally wouldn't think of mixing together to make delicious healthy juices.  We had one combining dragon fruit, mangoes, banana, and apple juice.  Another juice had avocado and ginger among many other fruits that was complex, delicious, and refreshing.  I look forward to going back and trying the food, even though I'm not vegan."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"DELICIOUS.  This is the best Vegan place I've been to in Miami.  The chefs are playful and fun.  They love talking to everyone in the place.  The restaurant has a bunch of loyal customers and for a good reason.  The food is fresh, delicious, and inspired.  I ate a dish called Tres Amigos that came with a sweet cilantro salsa on top with a small salad.  The presentation is simple and lovely.  I had the carrot, beet, celery juice that the other reviewer mentioned and it was DELICIOUS, sweet and nutritious.  ,I am going to make sure that I go back there again and again.  The place is absolutely a hole in the wall, but the service and food is so good that it doesn't matter.  From the outside it looks a little grungy, but that's because the lights aren't that bright and it has dark wood, so it looks a little dirty but everything on the inside is super clean."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/3/2011,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love this place. I come here as often as I can, and usually grab a bite to eat and some empanadas to keep in the fridge. Carlos, the chef is fantastically kind and makes everything fresh every day. It's all vegan, which didn't bother me when I ate meat (it's realllllyyyyy good) and is much appreciated now.,Everything is fresh and home-made. It's all very good. Carlos will let you try anything before you decide what you want. Smoothies and juices are good too. (Spirulina smoothie especially!) I guess some people are put off by how old everything is but I always see everything washed thoroughly and the staff washing their hands all the time. I think people are confusing clutter and age with cleanliness, to be honest. I really don't know what else to say. Just go here. It's delicious, unpretentious and won't make you feel gross after eating."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/25/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Amazing little vegan restaurant in a little health foods grocery store.  Food is so tasty, you know it was made with much love and the price point is ridiculously affordable. My money goes twice to three times as far here compared to other vegan restaurants/restaurants with health conscious choices.  Wish they had a location closer to downtown.  Everything is bomb."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/24/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I absolutely love this place. Mom & Pop vibe. The food is great and the desserts are fantastic! Gotta try their vegan cupcakes! One must definitely try their smoothies. I've had a few of them and they are delicious!  Me fave is the Rainforest :) Also, the market portion of Beehive is fantastic if you're looking for natural products/supplements. This place has quickly become one of fave local markets and food spots! Check it out! :)"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/6/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Call for their specials, soooo worth it.  I had the asparagus soup and kale & brown race cake.  Tiny, non-pretentious, vegan. Love."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/29/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Chef Carlos concocts the most delish vegan dishes. The new and larger location is wonderful. You can eat healthy food and get expert advice on vitamins and supplements at the same time!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/10/2010,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,"Im not Vegan but it was pretty nice.  The owner is awesome and funny as hell.  ,If your Vegan you'll probably love this place...  "" eat with your eyes close"" I was told....."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/26/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Alright, let me kick this off by saying I consider myself hipster to the bone. I mean, I start my day by putting on my horn-rimmed glasses, sparking up a hand-rolled cigarette, riding to work on my fixed-gear bicycle, and then writing reviews on Yelp that have a surprising amount of hyphens in them. None of those things are true except all of them, but the point still stands: hipster to the bone. When I walked into Beehive, however, I felt more mainstream than a migrating salmon. This place is seriously two weeks away from becoming a hippie compound, and I love it. The store itself is alright, stocked with seriously obscure items such as rose scented Dr. Bronner's soap, but just a bit-overpriced as expected. The juice bar/restaurant, however, is where it's at. They have a bunch of handmade vegan dishes, deserts, and, of course, juice, all of which are reasonably priced. You'll pay somewhere around $4 for a juice, $5 for a smoothie, and maybe something like $7 to $12 for a sandwich/main dish. On top of it all, the staff is friendly. As a native from New England, it felt a little bit like a trip to Vermont. While some in Miami who pedicure far too often or who drink creatine like their life depends on it probably won't be fans of Beehive, this place is a gem for those other people who catch obscure references or who grow out their armpit hair probably a bit too much. But, hey, I'm not judging anyone here, I mean, this entire review is basically an explicit judgement, but hey, you know, that's just how the vegan cookie crumbles."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/3/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I landed in Miami last month, and immediately went to Yelp to find a vegan restaurant.  I was on a Daniel Fast and was in need of a meal I would not have to assemble from the sides and veggie options available in a typical restaurant.  Yelp brought me to the Beehive and Carlos and Coco.  This place is a quaint, hole in the wall health food store with the most creative, delicious vegan food I've ever tasted.  Eating there made me believe I could be vegan for the rest of my life!  I'll definitely be going back there when ever I'm in town!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/4/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Yes, it has its quirks. BUT this place has fresh, delicious vegan fare, that has been home cooked with love. Carlos fills it with such positive energy you can't help but smile. It also has a lot of regulars, which gives it a hometown diner feel once you've been there a few times. You'll leave fully satisfied with no food hangover."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/12/2012,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Nestled in the back of a quaint, little health food store, Beehive may just be the best place for vegetarian/vegan food in Miami.  And unlike many of the city's health food restaurants, it won't cost you half a pay check to eat here.  I've read a few reviews by people whining about how ""cluttered"" the place is, or even went so far as to call it filthy.  Well if you're a spoiled brat who doesn't understand the concept of limited space, then maybe you'd feel that way, but it's as clean as any other restaurant that cares about providing an excellent experience, and that they do.  Beehive's small size makes for some very intimate ambiance.  Customers and staff are constantly chatting back and forth, and everyone seems to know one another by first name.,The food is excellent, and there's always a nice variety to choose from.  I usually start with two options, for example, a broccoli/tofu pie with kale slaw, usually enough to hit the spot.  It's also not a bad idea to just opt for one main item, plus a side salad.  The salad portions are generous, and include avocado, sprouts, and shredded beets, not just your typical run-of-the-mill salad ingredients.  Try it with their homemade miso dressing, very pleasant and mild.  The desserts are exceptional.  I've always found vegan friendly desserts to be very hit or miss, but they seem to have it down.  Their cakes especially are usually superb, especially the blueberry. ,Just give it a shot, they don't have a ton of loyal patrons for nothing.  You'll leave feeling great."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/28/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Awesome little cafe for people of all tastes! I'm vegan and find this a rare gem in Miami..it's delicious, affordable, and healthy. Would definitely recommend."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/12/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,My absolute favorite place for healthy and affordable meals!! Both food and shakes exceed my expectations of vegan food!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/11/2015,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love this place! Everything is absolutely delicious. Everything they offer is vegan friendly and most things are gluten free ( they always let you know when something isn't.. Like barley soup!) Carlos is a super nice guy, always smiling and making people laugh. The rainforest smoothie is my personal favorite. The tres amigos with brown rice and vegetables is fantastic. Soy picadillo and seitan empanadas are great. They have a pretty big variety of healthy deserts, love the cookies, carrot cupcakes and chocolate cake. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the place always looks messy and not so clean. I am big on cleanliness, but the food is too good to stop going."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"this place is like the Cheers of hippies and fake-aterians alike.  The chef is a quirky Brazilian dude named Carlos that entertains his die hard fans with his Seitan Pie, Soy Chicharron and vegan Saltena which i might add taste closer to to a real saltena than most spots and it doesn't even have meat! whoa.,It is hard to get a seat during lunch since the business executive lunch people and the newly retired older folks on a health kick are busy yapping away and gawking at what eachother ordered.  It's cute, theres a sense of community when people in all walks of life are guzzling down shots of wheatgrass and passing around that papaya hot sauce Carlos makes. ,The Rainforest smoothie is a must try. been coming here since 2005 and won't stop."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/4/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. As a new vegan it's so hard to find food on the go. Not only can you get your natural herbal supplements,  vegan proteins,  and a ton of healthy goodies, there is a freaking mini restaurant in here. I had baked tofu which taste just like chicarron (fried pork). The owner is hilarious and let's you sample almost everything as long as you give a smile in return. HOT FOOD IS ONLY SERVED AFTER 1PM. A little downer but still worth it. I assume they cook first thing in the morning so everything is fresh!! But before 1 they still have killer juices and sandwiches."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This is hands down my favorite vegan/vegetarian/health food store/restaurants in the south Miami area. For the first time today I tried the Rainforest smoothie. That was amazing!!!! The ingredients sound very odd but it's simply delicious and very filling on its own: frozen bananas, avocado, apple juice, carrot juice, ginger, and lime (all natural and freshly squeezed). I also tried the spinach empanada from other yelper's reviews and it was simply outstanding!!! VERY good flavor. The squash soup was also very tasty and creamy with that perfect squash sweetness flavor. It's far from my work but it's my favorite lunchtime spot. PS- Gets full for lunch since there are only like 6 barstools at the counter. Best to take to go."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/1/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The Beehive has incredibly delicious and affordable homemade vegan food. The daily specials are fresh, healthy, and made with love. The smoothies are less than $5 and made with really good quality ingredients including fresh squeezed juices. Carlos is amazing! This place is truly one of a kind!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"If you are vegan it's right up your alley!! If you're not like me, then you'll be pleasantly surprised about how good the food is and you'll find yourself coming back again and again!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/10/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"yesterday was my first time here and I LOVED IT!! Health store with a juice bar is such a great idea. Everything looked very clean, fresh and welcoming. I had the mixed veggie juice and added cayenne pepper... juice was perfection!! i saw previous reviews about them using apple juice so I asked them about that and they said all the veggie juice use REAL apples. if it does have ""apple juice"" it does state it on the menu (usually only for the fruit smoothies) so they are not tricking you. the service in beehive was phenomenal and they will answer any questions you may have about there menu with no hesitation & everything in this location is truly organic and good for you. I also tried a pineapple cake that was gluten, dairy free & had low sugar so for a test, I took a piece home for me ( I have a milk allergy ) and for my diabetic mom to see if in the morning I would get a stomach ache and if her sugar would be high and guess what?!? I didn't get a stomach ache and my moms sugar was perfection. I also tried there vegan empanadas that were delish!! this place is perfect for anyone who watches what they eat and want top of the line vitamins. I have yet to check out the whole store because I was so into the food but I will be defiantly going back again and again and again !! they also have organic wine and beer that I will be buying next time I go to give that a try :) overall this place is a gem and I can't believe it took me this long to find it."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. I'm not even a vegan but I'm here twice a week at least for a good, fresh lunch that doesn't leave me ready to nap. Every dish and smoothie I've tried has been good, and the owner has great energy. It feels like a neighborhood hangout/cafe. Highly recommended!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/8/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Very Delicious place, they make it easy to be vegan with there great tasting meals. ,It is not the fanciest place in the world but they sure make up with it with great customer service and  healthy meals !"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/12/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here the other day with my non vegan friend. When we sat down they handed us samples of the soup. And before we left they also gave us a sample of a smoothie! Everything was delicious. We had the special which was tres amigos, with veggie rice and kale slaw. It was delicious. He kept saying how good the food was. We also tried the vegan and gluten free cupcakes! We shared the carrot cake one and chcolate one. They were sooo good. Neither of us are big fans of carrot cake but that cupcake was amazing! Ill definatly be coming back next time im in the area."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The best restaurant in Miami. Most of the dishes on the menu are vegan. There is an option of tuna salad. Everything they make is excellent. The juices and smoothies are incredible. The staff is very accommodating. Carlos, the chef and owner is great with a very positive energy. The atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming. They have a great variety of dishes every day. They offer kombucha and the best Acai bowl in Town. I have tried all the vegan restaurants in Miami and out of Miami. By far the Beehive is the best. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you Carlos for such an amazing gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/10/2012,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,"I occasionally try to eat vegetarian/vegan - in no way am I a sworn meat-eater. I'll eat veggie if it's interesting and tastes good. Sadly, we don't seem to have many options that qualify on the ""interesting"" front. Having clocked the positive Yelp reviews for Beehive, a place my parents used to hit up for vitamins in the 1980s, I was mildly excited to finally make it over to the Red-Bird Schenley Park area for lunch.,Upon arrival, I was informed that they didn't have anything, except for veggie sandwiches, and cheese sandwiches. Groan. Veggies are fine in a sandwich, densely layered upon something thick and meaty. But veggies, as the main event? Sigh. Kill me now. ,The sandwich was some lettuce, tomato, carrot and sprout affair on whole wheat bread. It tasted as dull as it sounds. Some vinaigrette was provided in a bottle, and that helped the sandwich out somewhat.,OK, it filled me up. Fine. But I knew that was fool's gold, and I'd be hungry again in 30 minutes. I noted a cake of some sort sitting on the counter, in one of those containers you'd have expected to see on an old-timey 1950s Woolworth's lunch counter. I inquired. It was some kind of vegan strawberry-blueberry cake. It saved the meal. With what tasted like cream cheese icing, this cake was actually quite good. It wasn't over-sweetened, and tasted like real strawberries and blueberries.,I'd go back for the baked goods, but to earn more stars from me - I'm gonna need more than a carrot-and-sprout sandwich."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/13/2016,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,Small parking lot. We tried the salteñas and the spinach empanadas. I highly recommend the vegan salteñas. We think the food could use more spice or offer a spicy salsa to go with the food.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/19/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It's hard to find a mom and pop organic spot in Miami. This place not only has fresh organic products, but the staff is super friendly as well! My boyfriend and I had a tuna salad, tuna sandwich, vegan coconut cake (which is to die for) two wheatgrass shots, and a kombucha drink all for $30! Definitely our new healthy go to spot!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/15/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I had the rainforest juice, eggplant, quinoa and veggies, and a carrot cake cupcake.  All fresh, all delicious, all vegan.  A+++"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/5/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here to help my grandmother find some herbal supplements for her arthritis and the owner was working the counter. He was super helpful and knowledgable and they had both herbs we were looking for (dragons claw and celery seed). Then of course, being a vegan, I walked around the aisles and found they had so many goodies. On top of that, the juice I had was delicious and I ended up buying 4 vegan empanadas to go. They were awesome needles to say, this spot is a hidden gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/19/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Every time I go to this juice bar, my experience is better than the last. The employees are always welcoming and will greet you with a smile. They are knowledgeable and will help you if you need any advice on what to get. There is also a store near the  juice bar containing natural foods and home remedies. If you need a suggestion to aid an ailment this is a pretty good spot if you rely on natural products. The food itself is phenomenal as far as vegan options go. They have a large selection and will cater to any requests. All around a great little spot."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/1/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"First time here and a non vegan and it's so good !,The atmosphere is nice and small. The owner is very welcoming and nice. ,I ordered the hummus sandwhich which was amazing ! And the raw cinnamon rolls as well. That was soooo good ! ,I highly recommend checking this place out!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/24/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,Love the vegan guava and cheese pastries and that you sell the spirutein protein powder packets. Nice vibe and I'll be back regularly!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/31/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The very first thing that greats you when you walk into Beehive, is that it's actually a market for natural and Vegan products and that on the left side is the actual bar.,Awaiting is the owner - whose name I did not get - with a big smile on his face and an immense aura of friendliness that almost makes you suspect the quality of the food.,Then when you order any number of different salads or the daily main entree, or any of the smoothies and juices, you quickly realize you are somewhere that respects quality and that respects food.,In it's simplicity, the menu offers fresh vegetables and impeccably constructed pastries. ,Throughout your lunch, the owner is very attentive to your needs and he will continuously be friendly.,Highly Recommended."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/19/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,For not being a vegan the  lunch specials are not only good but priced even better call ahead and place your order when you're on the way there's only a few guys behind the bar so it takes them a little while to get an order out especially if you're ordering a shot or a fresh juice which I highly recommend
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/24/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Beehive's new location still deserves five stars for delivering solid vegan and veggie eats in an area where they're not readily available. I remember being intimidated the first time I visited the small location but this spot is definitely more welcoming. ,The shop is now a lot bigger so there are a few tables away from the counter if you want to sit down and enjoy. The health market is also easier to peruse although I've never picked up anything myself. ,My go-to order is a Rainforest smoothie and a picadillo empanada with miso dipping sauce. It's deceivingly really filling so I rarely have room for a sweet treat, but when I do, it's always delicious. They have rotating daily specials and the owner Carlos will probably give you a sample of the soup of the day which is always tempting. Usually you'll find some sort of rice, beans, protein and veggies, making for the perfect plate at a decent price! ,The smoothie menu is now expanded and easier to read but I rarely venture from that Rainforest!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/27/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,This is definitely my favorite juice bar in miami! The prices are not high and you get amazing quality juices and food. Everything taste fresh and delicious! I recommend everyone to check it out especially vegans! Super great vibes everytime!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/23/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"My all time favorite vegan spot and juice bar! I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian/vegan options are phenomenal. Always fresh and delicious, with new specials every day. Tons of fruits and veggies to pick from. Desserts are also vegan and delicious, as well as smoothies and juices. Owner is super friendly and service is amazing!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/27/2017,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Vegan and very tasty. Very casual spot, so service I thought could've been better. But all around a positive experience."

Possibly. If I can I always will make time to stop on by.,Thank you Carlos, you have blessed us for many years with your master in cooking."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/14/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Nice vegan food and juices. The owner is always overseen everything. I liked the empanadas and Rain forest smoothie. You must visit this wonderful hidden gem.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/10/2018,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Praise for Beehive!! Don't let the facade fool you. It looks like just a store, but you can also get yummy vegetarian/vegan options made fresh for you in their little restaurant. ,I was in the area and looking for something ultra healthy and natural and found this spot. We tried two fruit smoothies one with vegetable protein and one without. Highly recommend! In addition, we got the soy picadillo empanadas and mushroom empanadas. Holy wow! I was so impressed with the flavor that I'm going tomorrow to take some back to Ny with me. ,We also took the green salad to go and a Fred Vega table sandwich in Ezekiel bread. The perfect lunch. ,Would love to go back and try more items and shop around."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/1/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This is probably in my top 5 places that I love going to and eating at! I absolutely love everything that's there is to offer in this little gem. This is a vegan spot but delicious and cooked to perfection. Everyday they have a different menu with a soup of the day, doesn't matter what's on the menu because everything is delicious including there delicious homemade deserts mind you this is all still vegan that will blow your taste buds away. Prices are also great nothing expensive all reasonable prices for great healthy food. The owner by the way is great guy and makes you feel comfortable with great service at the little mini restaurant bar. Cheers!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/29/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love love love this place, they sell so many natural/ cruelty free products & have amazing vegan food that tastes like it's made with love. The prices are fair and the products are great"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/24/2017,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I always find that they have the best selection of vegan dishes freshly prepared every day. I am not vegan but I do enjoy the creativity put into making meatless dishes that taste fantastic and are beneficial to your health. ,Their juice bar is on point, no frills, just a juicer and the freshest fruits and veggies in whatever combo you prefer. They also have a menu with suggestions and they are very helpful in giving you suggestions depending on your health needs. ,I like that they carry a nice selection of herbs, powders, and other natural health related items. You can find anything from deodorant to tea, to salt lamps. ,Everyone is friendly and seems to recognize me even though I don't frequent regularly. ,The food and juices are reasonably priced and definitely made with love and care."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/12/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Living down south I try to make it as often as I can, and every single time I go Carlos is as welcoming as always. The food is probably one of the best in the Miami area and the vegan brownies are to die for! Within my personal favorites are the lentil soup, tres amigos and even the empanadas are delicious. Recommend 100%."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/24/2012,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Not only was the food excellent, their service was good too, which is hard to find in Miami.  We had the spring rolls, pad thai, and red curry.  We ordered everything vegetarian and our server asked if we were vegan.  While we are not vegan, it shows that the restaurant is willing to make adjustments and be vegan friendly.  Also, the entrees are big enough to share, so the food can be economical if you are willing to share food."
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",1/9/2014,$$,5,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"Fresh, made-to-order vegan/vegetarian/kosher-friendly food, and even friendlier people! I'm from New York City and can tell you this is far from the traditional Jewish deli. I wasn't in the mood for soup, but they make a new one from scratch every day, and the lentil one I sampled was delicious. If you're eating alone like I was, this is the best place to have a sit-down meal because everyone who works here is a total sweetheart.,They have an in-house sushi chef who makes a mean tempura vegetarian roll. If you don't believe vegans can enjoy sushi, think again! I also tried their meatless Schwarma special (listed under specialty sandwiches and includes your drink). Picture a soft pita corner stuffed with vegan steak, tahini, hummus and all the spicy dressings. Then double that image, and fill the rest of the plate with fresh, crispy shoestring fries, and you have the special. The two entrees were more than enough food for two people, but I took the other half the go.,My total came out to a measly $20 before tips, which is a steal considering I had enough food for 2 meals. I will however say that the tempura sushi loses the crispness after being in the fridge and fries don't take well to being microwaved, so do yourself a favor and eat it fresh!"
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",5/25/2016,$$,5,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"Bagels, Falafel, Pizza and Sandwiches!!! Vegetarian, Vegan friendly and Kosher. ,Fast, friendly and very clean:)"
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",10/29/2014,$$,4,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"I love this place. When I worked downtown, I used to go at least twice a month if not more. The food is excellent. Because it is a kosher restaurant, many of the dishes are vegetarian or vegan by default, which is perfect for me. What I like most about the restaurant, however, is how nice the owner is. He would always remember me and what I liked.  He was eager to recommend new dishes and let me try samples. It's hard to find restaurants in Miami where owners try to build relationships with their patrons, so it was a real treat to be a customer here."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",8/17/2017,$$,4,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"The food was great although for me, the vegan choices were very limited.  Their menu does list the vegan choices however and the vegan speciality they had, the only vegan entree, was fantastic.  A little expensive but not ridiculous and if you're a wine drinker, I'm not, it's probably 5 star as they have a lot of wines and even a wine tasting barrel."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",6/29/2017,$$,5,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"My first time going to Cooper's Hawk was an enjoyable one! I went for dinner last night 6.28.17 with a group of girlfriends and loved it so much, I've been raving about it to everyone since! I can't wait to return for happy hour! The restaurant is located in CityPlace, a new upscale entertainment shopping mall-like area in Doral. Our reservation was for 7:30pm, but we had a difficult time locating parking near the reataurant, so i recommend to go straight to the parking garage. I was there for 2hrs and parking was $4.00. The wait staff greeted us w a huge smile and immediately took us to our table. Sweet décor, with fancy and comfortable booths all over. Rachel, our server was exceptional, you can tell she has food service experience and is very well informed on both the food and wine menus..not to mention friendly, attentive and courteous. She immediately explained the concept of the restaurant and informed us of the complimentary wine samples for up to 3 different wines per person. She initially brought the Winemaker's Barrel Reserve to try...very generous pour and so delicious..it was a Bordeaux, then the Hawk Red end finally the Cabernet Sauvignon..We recieved a warm pretzel bread w a side of honey mustard..so yummy and soft..we had 2 of those. The menu is extensive and they cater to vegan/vegetarians, so i was pretty happy..i ordered for my entree, the Veggie Burger..oh sooo soo good! I veggie paddy is made from red quinoa, black beans and rolled oats..just wow and its huge too!! It comes w a side of fennel quinoa salad..one gal had the brussel sprouts appetizer, which were charred perfectly and had a delicious sesame sriracha aioli sauce on top and the portion was large. We were all satisfied w our foods! No complaints, just total raves! For desserts, we had a chocolate covered strawberries! Perfecr! Everyone was delighted with their food and overall experience. Will definitely be returning soon!"
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",2/11/2018,$$,4,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,"A definite 4 and 1/2 star ranking.  I will go with a 4 here.  I came in here while on jury duty and was pleasantly surprised.  They have excellent vegan options.  There was a wide variety of items on the menu.  I ordered the falafel plate and it was delicious.  The service was fast and efficient.  The set up to order and pay is a little unconventional.  One of the servers was offering samples of the soup of the day when I was in. , There was plenty of seating and the decor was simple.  The restaurant was clean.  Holy Bagels and Pizzeria has an Israeli vibe going on.  I would certainly go back if I lived or worked in the area."
"93 NW 1st St, Miami, FL 33128",1/16/2018,$$,5,Holy Bagels & Pizzeria,Amazing!! The best salad I have had in a while! The menu is spectacular. Loads of options. A wonderful selection of vegetarian and vegan options. First time trying soy chicken and I love it here. Will definitely be back!

"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/10/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Really fresh and tasty Thai food, the servers were so helpful and very polite and had a great knowledge of vegan food (suggested a substitute for the sauce with the spring rolls which was delicious) would definately visit or order out from here again if I'm in the area :)"
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",11/19/2011,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Happily another surprise gem in the Gables. I used to eat here when I was an omnivore who lived down the street. Now I'm a vegan who lives in South Beach, and without a car, it's rare that I get to the Gables. But when I'm there, I still want to eat (c'mon, I ALWAYS want to eat!).,I was asking questions about the menu (as we vegans are known to do) and the server actually said to me, ""You tell me you're vegan, I'll make your meal vegan."" That simple. He was knowledgeable and friendly and I had some delicious vegan spring rolls and a phenomenal veggie curry.,I'm always on the lookout for places I can eat with my non-vegan friends where we can ALL be happy. Lotus Garden is definitely a winner on that list."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/23/2018,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Love this place! The food is delicious, the portion just right and it's great value. There are vegan options. They offer take out. It's a winner! ,It's nice it's not a chain. The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is always relaxed and welcoming."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",10/12/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,Absolutely loved the food and service! We had green curry and the penang curry which were both phenomenal. They were also awesome in accommodating for a vegan diet.
"1547 SW 27th Ave, Miami, FL 33145",3/1/2018,$,5,El Palacio De Los Jugos,"My go to place for fast- home made style authentic Hispanic food. And guárapo that NEVER fails me ! What havent I tried from here... I wonder. Ive even had the sandwiches. The desserts, the fruits, the salads. I LOVE IT ALL. Never really had an issue and I usually share a $12 meal with 3 people and it's very filling. The people who work here are extremely sweet ladies. I'm so glad I just moved 2 minutes from here now I go walking there all the time for a passion fruit juice run. Did I mention... I'm vegan ! But I still love this place and the delicious vegan options they have that are not limited at all compared to other Spanish places where I'm stuck eating rice and beans."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,3,Yuzu,"Vegan Ramen review ... I really wanted to love this ramen but it was just an okay ramen for me. Broth was ok need a little bit more flavor to develop in the broth. The mushroom in the ramen was amazing!! the give you a lot of them . I feel as tho the fried garlic looks great on top but once they in the broth they get soaky and made it very greasy. The noodles was really good , perfectly cooked. This vegan ramen needs a little bit of love , maybe add some nori for more flavor , something pickle to cut the greasiness. The staff here was very nice. i'll be back to try some other dishes that they have."

The owner is very sweet and attentive. The location is cute and nicely decorated. I heard the owner used to have a cupcake shop. I wonder if she'll ever open a vegan bakery now that this business is thriving."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/6/2012,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I went to The Last Carrot for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious! I had the felafel pita sandwhich. The pita bread was very thin, so it's kind of a messy sandwhich and I would recommend that you either ask for a fork or keep it wrapped up as you eat it. The sandwhich comes with a green sauce, I have no idea what's in this sauce but it is so good. The place is your typical hipster kind of vegan hole-in-the-wall place in coconut grove so you cannot expect it to be so pristine. Everything is natural and made right in front of you so if you don't like what you see you can walk right out. I only gave it 4 stars because of the cleanliness, but the fact that they were preparing my lunch right in front of me was a huge plus! Everyone was very nice it took a few minutes for the girl to acknowledge us, but nothing I would complain about, the bar was almost completely full and she was only one of 2 servers/cooks so it's understandable. I would recommend this place if you want to have a quick, healthy lunch with a home-made feel. I didn't try the juices but they looked amazing and I will be going back to try one."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/4/2009,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot isn't much to look at, but from the second I walked in the door I knew that I had made it to a little slice of vegan heaven. Instead of trying to decide between Chinese take out classics like Buddha's Delight and Bean Curd & Eggplant or pizza (no cheese) plus a meager list of toppings from the local pizzeria, I had a full menu to choose from including vegan desserts! It had only been a week since I dined at an ultra vegan-friendly restaurant but it seemed like an eternity and I took my time looking over the menu. Would I try the Spicy Tofu Pita Sandwich? Maybe the Hummus Pita? Homemade Veggieburgers are always a safe choice. Or did I want to go for one of their ginormous (yes that's a word, because I say so!) salads. Maybe some hearty soup and a salad. Then there was the prospect of having a smoothie made from real fruit, not concentrated fruit juice or syrups. As I tried to make my decision I looked down to see a huge vegan cake beckoning me to come closer and a full case of vegan cookies and brownies.

"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/14/2017,$$,4,Ms Cheezious,"Yesterday I had the crab grilled cheese with vegan cheese, so good! They have tons of different flavored sauces and condiments to choose from too. This place is great for lunch."
"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/22/2016,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"We loved the truck. Got stoked when they opened up a restaurant. Now, we rejoice a restaurant has opened up closer to us. Tricky to find, as they tend to leave the door open (source for the only sign). Look for the pin-up lady cartoon and pure golden. I appreciated that they were able to split the bill, at the counter. Same great food. Awesome service. Quick table turn around/venue kept super-clean. And the bathrooms... You vocals love in there. Wait staff truly cares for your best dining experience. We had the buffalo sandwich (had a nice kick) and the chicken and waffles (gravy tastes homemade). They do have a vegan option. Board games and Condiments off to the side. The midnight snack, a shake with whip cream, chocolate sprinkles, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered Ruffle chip, and caramel corn, was heaven. No doubt, we will be back!"
"1915 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/7/2017,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"HOW can you not give this place 5 stars!? My friends and I had such a great experience. We went for lunch right at noon and the place wasn't busy yet. We got a chance to take in the menu and put in our orders! I went with the crab with avocado and vegan cheese which was SO GOOD! Wow, I mean you can't really mess up a grilled cheese but this spot gives you all the options to make it the best. They have so many different sauces and even offer tomato soup!,My friends got the short rib and other savory meat grilled cheeses which they GUSHED over. Also the mac n cheese was so decadent and rich - definitely one to share! The oreo milk shake was also extremely tasty. Just in awe after lunch here!!"
"11361 NW 12th St, Miami, FL 33172",4/1/2016,$$,5,P.F. Chang’s,"This is the best chain restaurant for a vegan to go! They are so accommodating and have many vegan options compared to other ones. I had the vegetarian lettuce wraps and the ma po tofu and they were so good that my omni family kept eating it!! Everyone loved it even grandma who didn't even know what tofu was. The service is very good every time we go, they are always nice and attentive of our needs and we never have to ask for things like refills. Definitely my favorite pf changs location in Miami. And I've been to pretty much all of them. The staff is also consistent, I've been waited on by the same girl for over two years now and she always recognizes us and asks about anyone who may not have gone to the restaurant that specific day. Hoping to go back soon so I can try the Buddhas feast because I've been scared to try it but not for long. The only thing I would ask for is a vegan dessert because it's kinda horrible watching everyone eating desserts and not being able to have one yourself."
"11361 NW 12th St, Miami, FL 33172",2/9/2018,$$,4,P.F. Chang’s,"I've always been a sucker for mall chain restaurants... There are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans here. The veggie spring rolls come with chili plum sauce, you can get 2 or 4. There's edamame, salads, and side noodles. There's a vegetarian entree section- I like Buddha's feast (broccoli, carrot, peas, asparagus, mushrooms, tofu with brown sauce) with brown rice. Ask your server about what's in each sauce to be sure. The fried rice he egg in it- you can order without. They also have a nice wine selection. The bathroom was not very clean."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/27/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"I randomly (and happily) stumbled upon Ten Fruits last week on a walk to Bayfront Park. The decor is clean, white, and minimal with facts about healthy foods written all over the walls in a cool newspaper style.  All juices are made from fresh fruits and vegetables with a slow pressed juicer; I learned that this is to retain all of the nutrients that are otherwise lost from the heat and friction of a fast juicer. Juices come in large portions (16 oz) and are bottled with a lid. Ten Fruits also offer salads, Acai power bowls, empanadas, waffles, and quiches, many of which are vegan-friendly. I'm super excited to have found a healthy and delicious place to get my daily serving of fruits and vegetables within walking distance of where I live. I will most definitely be becoming a regular here.,I also hear that Ten Fruits is opening a location in Coral Gables soon!"
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"So I was at Ten Fruits, dropping a deuce in the men's bathroom, when I noticed that the wallpaper surrounding me were these Wikipedia pages of some the most underrated antioxidants known to man (You know, because Yuppies jusy need to be educated). Anyway, I knew about Acai, I just didn't really how to say it -- now I do. With that said, I was very impressed by my Acai bowl, it was even designed like something out of one of those glossy, colorful Vegan recipe books.,But Ten Fruits is cute; something that Miami is looking to transition into, I think. It's always difficult when you're that one organic/health food place surrounded by a bunch of Cuban sandwiches. This place was legit, though, in all honesty."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/9/2014,$$,4,Ten Fruits,"In a nutshell: it's free wi-fi, vegan/vegetarian-friendly, great place for clean eating in the downtown Miami area.,If you think waffles without copious amounts of butter and syrup is criminal, you were not alone, but the whole wheat waffles here are soft and moist without losing their crisp and are tasty topped with fresh fruits and agave. I had the whole wheat waffle + super smoothie combo, with an almond milk latte.,The guy that saw me looking the menu on his way out must have seen my hangover because he suggested the Green Giant, which I can now say is a certifiable cure! It blends avocado, pineapple, coconut water, vanilla and agave for a tasty drink that hydrates and restores electrolytes.,The coffee was okay, they get their beans from Panther which is a popular gourmet coffee shop in the Wynwood Arts District. Unfortunately the almond milk was over-whipped and actually had it's own texture, which made it really hard to keep drinking. I really think almond milk has too thin of a consistency to be properly whipped, so I probably would have been fine if I had ordered my usual soy latte."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/26/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I like this place, the food is good, they've got a range of vegan and gluten-free options, and the atmosphere is casual, quiet and great for a mellow leisurely lunch. The food is prepared before your eyes in a relatively clean kitchen, free (but limited) parking and cash only (as far as I know). The staff is cordial but the service is glacial whether he place is empty or at peak hours. Don't go for lunch on a week day, you won't get back to work in time even if you ask for takeout. I would recommend ordering by phone and picking up."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/25/2010,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Fresh papaya juice and wheat veggie pita with hummus. Health Nut list to the max. The great Vegetarian and Healthfood Counter in the grove.  The spinach pies are also pretty yummy.  This is not a strictly vegetarian place, they do serve chicken and tuna, but its all fresh (at least that's what the food tastes like).  They make great juices and smoothies with all natural ingredients.  It is expensive for a hole in the wall hippie place - a pita sandwich made of hummus and freshly squeezed juice with a vegan brownie for desert cost about $10.  I wouldn't label this posh though because I'm sure the rent is more expensive than the locally grown and raised ingredients."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/10/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,This hidden gem has the best fresh vegan/organic food a girl could ask for. It's so good that the line is to the door during lunch hour so make sure you order ahead of time. The girls that work the counter are always so nice & hospitable - they never fail to call me by name. I highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it! :)
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/1/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I wish there were more places like this in Miami. The menu is simple but always good. Fresh squeezed juices, home made dressings, plentiful veggies, tasty toppings, and homemade vegan dessert. All you have to do is sit at the bar, and order your food, the staff are very nice btw. But you will wait a little if it's lunch time I suggest coming a little before or after the rush, or ordering beforehand if time is crucial for you. Best fresh food around and at a reasonable price. Really, they can't make it easier."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/9/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"Small place, bar counter service and free parking. No matter what ""sandwich"" you get the sauce will make it great. I had the veggie burger and she had a hummus. Everything is served on a very thin pita. So, if you don't like it messy you may wish to order a pie (think empenada here). We showed up 15 minutes before they closed on Sunday evening so they were out of a few fruits for smoothies and the place could use some attention to being clean (bathroom especially). The motto that rang out was ""at least it is vegan"". I just hope all behind the scenes was cleaner than what met the eye but that is rarely the case. ,Vegan cookie was a treat and great. How often do you get a vegan white chocolate macadamia cookie (or was it vegan). Also, it was nice to have a fresh juice though this close to the mall scene.,In short - It was tasty. I just can't truly trust it."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/11/2015,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Me and my wife love this place! It's a little hole in the wall in the grove, with very friendly service and great food. We usually always get the chicken pita with all the veggies plus avocado & either a smoothie or fresh juice. The best part is getting dessert, they usually have some kind of vegan, organic, gluten-free delicious cake!!!!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/30/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"A local health/vegan favorite.  VERY ""divey"" and ""hole in the wall"" but that's part of the charm.  Limited menu but what they ave is delicious AND GET PLENTY OF SAUCES (you'll know what I mean after you try them both)."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/24/2014,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot is a Coconut Grove staple, cherished by Groveites and non-Groveites alike.  I've been coming here for over 25 years, and, though I moved away, I always make it a point to come here to get lunch at least once during my visits back home.  Everything is fresh and tasty. My favorites are the cream cheese and cucumber pita and the chicken or tuna salad melt served in the spinach pie (not the Greek style ones, more like a triangular shaped pita filled with spinach).  They use the spinach pies that are baked fresh at The Daily Bread (soooo good). I always get the green sauce to have with my sandwiches.  I don't know how they make that stuff, but I could put that on anything and everything I eat!  Additionally, they were making fresh, healthy juices way before juicing was cool, and their grasshopper (pineapple with wheatgrass) is delicious. Their vegan desserts are also very good; I, personally, am a big fan of their brownies. The place is family owned and service is always quick and good."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/7/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,Awesome vegan place!! If you want a quick juice or healthy snack this is the place to go. I got the special of the day the falafel pita which was amazing and the orange and carrot juice. It was quick easy and decliious. The only thing I didnt like is that they only take credit cards!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/20/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"One of the best vegan spots in Miami with a nice range of Juices, Smoothies, Spinach Pies, Salads, and Sandwiches... All the juices are refreshing - my personal favorite is the Orange-Papaya... Though the smoothie selection isn't as big, they incorporate their seasonal fruits... They have tasty sandwiches, salads, and quiches that come with their original sauces which are a must on any dish. My favorite dish is the Tuna Melt, it's name is fitting since the sandwich literally melts in your mouth! The only critique is that they don't accept credit cards and they close pretty early- definitely a place for lunch rather than dinner."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/14/2015,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been going there for over 20 years and it is STILL one of my favorite places. LOVE the chicken salad in a pita with   green vinaigrette, cheese and tomato spinach pie, fresh apple juice and vegan carrot cake!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I really like the Last Carrot's menu. They offer health food that is actually delicious and filling. Although a simple dish, the Baked Tofu Salad is very flavorful, vegan and pretty filling -- specifically, the baked tofu and the salad dressings are what make the salad so flavorful (ask for both dressings so you can decide which one you like better; I like them both). ,I make a meal out of a salad and a spinach pie. I love the spinach pies! The cheese is deliciously melty and I like how it's not a typical spinach pie because they use a healthy whole wheat pita instead of a fatty flaky crust. ,Aside from the food, the service is a little spotty. I've been here and have been completely ignored or unacknowledged for at least 5-10 minutes before someone said hello and took my order. Other times I've waited less than 5 minutes and the staff seemed pretty pleasant. I guess you'll never know what the service will be like here but at least they make up for it with delicious food!,I'll definitely keep coming back here for the reason that the way I feel after a meal is energized, healthy and satisfied. I'd rather go here for lunch than Chipotle and feel completely stuffed and gross after."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/15/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"This spot has been my favorite for years! Good ol' clean and delicious food. It's always satisfying and friendly on your pocket. It's good for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. I'll forever be faithful to this place."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/4/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I've been going to this place for years and the food will always be deeelicious.  My favorite is the spinach pie with tomato and avocado.  And don't forget the vinaigrette!  I'm not sure what's in this green sauce but man it's so flavorful and bright.  I could eat the stuff with a spoon it's so good.  Juices and smoothies are also very yummy, and they make an INCREDIBLE vegan chocolate cake. Definitely recommend!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/10/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"They were super friendly and more than willing to customize my order. Most of the eating area is counter top and definitely was the place to be during lunch hour. Anyone looking for a vegan or vegetarian eatery, this place is absolutely great!! Can't wait to come back again when I'm in Coconut Grove"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/27/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,Natural at its finest!  This place isbrefeeshing whether youre a vegan or just want to keep it light.  Had the grosshopper juice which had fresh pineapple and wheat grass shot.  So good. Iwas in the mood for something sweet so I ordered the peanut butter apple and banana PITA.  My daughter had the chicken salad pita that was stuffed with brussel sprouts and veggies delicious.  Everything was refreshing you feel good after you eat here I will definitely be back also prices are low under $10 per person.
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/5/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,I am a Coconut Grove Native and this is my favorite place to go eat on a regular. The chicken salad pita or the spinach pie with cheese extra crunchy with the tofu they marinate and bake so good. Yum. Then the dressings and the smoothies and the vegan cake..AND the brownies!!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/19/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Just walking into this place makes you feel like you can live to be 100.  The food and juices are so healthy and fresh.  I had the chicken salad with greens and the beet juice with ginger was extremely delicious and satisfying.  There is a little bit of a wait as the place is small and there are about three staff helping people.  The staff takes your order, prepares your meal and then helps the next group waiting.  It's great because you go get your food promptly after you order, but I think that for general customer satisfaction, if you had some interaction and then waited 10 minutes for your order as a customer you wouldn't feel as anxious.  The food is very good and as I said FRESH.  It's a great healthy alternative and has a lot of vegan options."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/15/2018,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been to The Last Carrot a few times and have always really enjoyed the food.  This is a juice and pita/salad place that serves up really good, really healthy stuff.  There is no table service, you have to order at the counter and bring it back to your seat.  I love the baked tofu.  The green sauce here should be bottled and marketed immediately.  Drink selection is somewhat limited and they do offer lots of natural juices and smoothie type drinks.  Great little vegetarian/vegan/healthy spot in the Grove.  It's homey and friendly but a touch on the loud side when the juicer starts up.  What a great spot for a quick bite that your body will thank you for."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2018,$$,3,Ten Fruits,Ten Fruits has a large selection of vegan salads and other fruit and vegetable forward dishes in addition to the array of smoothies and bowls on offer at the restaurant. I bought a corn salad from the fridge section and it was the perfect balance of acid and spiciness without overpowering any of the ingredients. It made me eager to try other dishes from the shop.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/30/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great concept, delicious food and a nice atmosphere! Friendly, helpful service. My husband and I tried the Wellness Smoothie, avocado toast and lentil bowl. As a traveling vegan, this was a rare find. Love the priority on healthy eating, which is unfortunately way too rare these days. Bravo to these awesome folks and their gamble that some people really do want healthy food, and it looks like it's paying off. Delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/23/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Omg this place is amazing Great to have found an organic juice bar that serves vegan food in the area, the place is beautiful and the best part is it's also drive thru when your on the run"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/8/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Thank goodness for a wonderful vegan option in the heart of Kendall. Even non-vegans would be happy to eat here! Everything I have ordered has been amazing. I only wish they were open later and would deliver!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/9/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Honestly, this was the most delicious smoothie bowl I've ever had. I had the dragon bowl and it is hands down gorgeous. It was delicious and all the fruit was perfectly ripe. It may be $8.50 but it was more than enough to share with my boyfriend. He enjoyed it too. It's nice to see a place like this, where a vegan can go and get something without it being a hassle in Miami. I can't wait to try more of their products. And the owner was sweet and adorable! I hope it does well!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is awesome. Juices are fresh and your body will thank you for drinking them. The food is delicious and extremely healthy - tastes like someone made it for you at home. I am not a vegan/vegetarian/health nut by any stretch of the imagination but I look forward to having a chance to stop in.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/14/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan but ran into this place and decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Dragon Bowl & Avocado Toast. The Dragon Bowl was amazing! Filling, refreshing & pretty lol! The avocado toast was good too, just too much avocado for me, but this seems like it should actually be a pro."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/28/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Even though I'm not a vegan, Roots is still one of my favorite lunch/breakfast go-to places in Miami. So if you're holding back on coming because you aren't vegan either, DONT! They're food is super great for everyone and their Fruit bowls and smoothies are the best thing to have on a hot Miami day. My best friend is vegan so it's nice to have a place near the area we can both go to enjoy. Wish they had more places down here like this one!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Super fun and friendly staff + absolutely delicious vegan food. The juices are also fantastic, not too sweet, yet aromatic and flavorful. Perfect!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/16/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have had just about all of their smoothies and they are all amazing! Although I am not vegan, I'm in love with this place. I can only afford to spend 9 bucks on a juice smoothie once every other week, but I have always enjoyed those smoothies up until the last slurp. :)"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/25/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Great vegan spot! Wish they had one closer to Doral. Drove down to try it after hearing good reviews and was not disappointed. Simple and delicious vegan food and fruit smoothies!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The best restaurant in miami. I love the food is very healthy and the smothies are awsome!!! Enjoy the vegan life.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/11/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So happy this place opened up! Finally don't have to drive far for a vegan friendly place! Tried one of their cold pressed juices, it was delicious. Can't wait to try their smoothies and snacks!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/21/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love love love this place! I am not vegan, but I would say this place is a vegans paradise! Every time I get a juice from Roots I instantly feel better, more energized, ready for my day. Their smoothies are sooo good! Crave is my favorite, it tastes like a cinnamon roll. I was never too much of a fan of pressed vegetables into a juice, but then I tried their juices and I never turned back(I've even thought about doing a juice cleanse, but I think I'll wait a while before doing that). Some people may think this place is expensive as all their juices/smoothies are $8 each, but you do get a lot of it. Also, if you're hungry I suggest you try the morning bagel! It honestly blew my mind when I remembered I wasn't eating actual cream cheese, it was full of flavor! Roots has a star reward program where if you get 10 stars you get a free drink! Totally recommend even if you're not into ""vegan"" places!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"love this place! great healthy option in the heart of kendall. this place reminds me of somewhere you'd typically find in coral gables or wynwood, so it's really refreshing to have healthier options closer to this part of town. i love the pb+j smoothie, and they have one of the best acai bowls i've tried. i love the atmosphere, even though it can get a little crowded while waiting for food during a rush. i'd rather pay $10 for a wholesome, vegan smoothie here vs $8 for a smoothie filled w sugar syrup somewhere else. it's priced about the same as any quality health food restaurant... not a ""cheap eats"" place, however quality ingredients cost more and you can tell the difference in the food and how you will feel after!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great staff, great service and most importantly great food! Really enjoy the acai bowl, PB&J smoothie! The zoodles with vegan bolognese was spectacular!"

Everything here is absolutely amazing! It's small but it's cozy for a quick bite to eat with a couple of friends or even just to grab a shake after a good workout! No matter the occasion Roots is the place to be!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not a vegan, I'm not a vegetarian, not even close. But this place is amazing. I crave it. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll crave meat too but I don't feel as good after eating meat the way I do after I eat here. What you're looking at in this picture is the acai bowl and the avocado toast. I've also have had the quinoa bowl, lentil bowl and the dragon bowl. They've never missed the mark."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love having this place right next to school. I have never had anything that I didn't like. Their smoothies are great - Pitaya is my favorite! Their acai bowls are also amazing! I also can't get enough of their squash soup - it's made without cream just the vegetable since it's vegan. I've also had their lentil bowl. Everything is so good and best part, healthy!  Highly recommend for a nice refreshing meal, you won't be disappointed."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So very pleased to have an organic vegan spot in West Kendall. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is peaceful. Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious, never too pricey. I just hope they continue the all organic everything movement. Some places start of organic then start slacking. I really appreciate healthy and organic food that I don't have to cook myself all the time. Keep up the amazing job!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely LOVE this place! My sister showed it to me and I just love the atmosphere they have created, not to mention the staff is super sweet and the food super nutritious and delicious!!! I've eaten the food on multiple occasions and I love everything!! It's simply amazing  if you're vegan or simply want a tasty healthy meals, Roots is the place for you !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOOOOVE this place. Just what kendall needed. The food is healthy and delicious, they have a variety of vegan choices, and the it's clean! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Now everyone seems to be raving over the dragon bowl, which is amazing, but my recommendations are either the fajita bowl or quinoa bowl paired with a pb+j smoothie. However, I have no doubts that anything you order won't be amazing."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm so glad a place like this opened up in Kendall close to where I live. This spot is perfect for a healthy/vegan/organic meal, snack, juice or smoothie. I wish I could eat here everyday! Roots is a small, modern, and very clean juice bar with a variety of options. I tried the fresh pressed juice named Verde I was worried I wouldn't find a juice without ginger (I'm not a fan) but they had several juices without it so I was pretty happy! As far as food, my favorites so far have been the quinoa bowl, acai bowl, dragon bowl, and avocado toast. I highly suggest you try the dragon bowl...so delicious! The owners are fully devoted in pleasing the customers. They are friendly and attentive and will give discounts for advertising their business on social media."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've gone twice this week, Monday being my first time. This place came highly recommended by a few people being that I'm always looking for vegan places and live in Kendall.. Omg. This place is phenomenal. Love the location, the food, the service! Only downfalls are (like all vegan restaurants) it's very pricey (but worth it) and it's very small, not enough seating. But that didn't mean I wasn't going to give this place anything less than 5 stars. I'm so happy it's so close to me, will be going there to often lol."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"What do you mean there's no meat!? I just had the frijole bowl and it was absolute fire. Portions didn't appear to be too challenging however, it fills you up fast. Barely able to withstand another bite, I mustered up the strength finish the last yummy morsel. The kind staff made for pleasant vibes. I may not be a vegan, but I can get used to eating like this especially if I get a free juice/smoothie for my loyalty."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a nice little place to get some healthy vegan meals and fresh raw juices. There isn't much seating, so if you come when it's busy you may choose to take your food with you. The prices are reasonable and the food is all healthy and tasty, the staff seem friendly and the overall vibe is nice. If you want a refreshing juice or a healthy place to eat as a vegan or vegetarian in Kendall this one is it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a rare find for me in Kendall, a cozy juice/smoothie bar with lots of organic and vegan breakfast/lunch/dinner options. I enjoyed the seating options inside and outside. ,I had the kidney bean dish with brown rice, asparagus and avocado/tomato toppings and it was really tasty. Like out of gramma's kitchen. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. ,I also had the crave smoothie, which was a little banana-y for my taste- I kinda wish it had more cacao taste, BUT it was my first time trying and when I go back I plan to try a new smoothie (the hot pink dragon fruit smoothie interested me) and maybe re-order the crave smoothie and ask for them to add more cacao flavor. I forgot to take a pic :( next time. I'll be back for sure."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Absolutely amazing! My favorite is the Quinoa bowl. The food is so fresh and delicious and I'm not even Vegan.

I love anything tropical and these smoothies are as tropical as they can get. Will definitely be stopping by often. Pitaya super smoothie is the bomb!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I cant remember if its vegetarian or full vegan but even if youre not - like me- you will feel inspired by the ambiance of kumbaya. There is a tree in the middle of the communal table. There all these inspirational messages around this tiny yet airy locale, the staff is adorably passionate about the products and DO NOT be fooled by the wholesome good organic ingredients- these people have found a way to delight your tastebuds while lovingly reminding you to love all living things. My daughter had a mango smoothie and it was like none I have ever had. It was sophisticated and thick and yes- spicy. I dont even like spicy. But this. This was beautiful. It wasnt cheap -like $8 but like a great meal.  So satisfying. The hours are strict though - closed by 630p weekdays and must check weekend times. But it was clearly a nod to holistic living where we all equally respect and enjoy time. Next time we are trying the smoothie bowls which people keep raving about. But I feel like I gotta fast for two days first - to be deserving of such holy fare. To make room for the calories. (Lets not confuse healthy ingredients for low calorie ones - hahahaha!). Oh yes. We are going back."

Roots is a small, quaint and modern juicebar that makes all of their own juices daily with the freshest of ingredients. They bottle their juices but can make a smoothie or other juice for you on request too. They serve vegan sustainable food that is absolutely delicious! I had the Lentil bowl and not only did it fill me up, but it was full of flavor! I had their ""Cooler"" green drink which is a blend of Fennel Root, Basil, Cucumber, Lime, and Apple. It was absolutely amazing! I took a Cashew milk to go and also their Avocado toast. The owner said that if I just call him he can deliver the food to me on the days that I work which I think is really awesome. ,It's really nice to have local places like this that serve a variety of different and highly nutritious food. They are so passionate about what they do and tell you the health benefits of everything in their food. NSU employees get a discount too! (Although the discount for checking in on Yelp is better :) ,I am looking forward to having healthy lunches and post-workout drinks/meals now. This place was really awesome! It's definitely small and cannot seat that many people, but it's such a great place!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm a vegan. Hands down the best Vegan restaurant in Miami! The prices are fair and the quality is outstandingly great. The ambience is very chill and cool. Other than the place being small, everything is amazing!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/30/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've recently become a vegan and my friend recommend me to come here after my workout. Let me tell you how amazing the food is here. I always leave here feeling good. I had the frijoles bowl with brown rice, asparagus, chopped up tomatoes and avocados. Very yummy! Also, their smoothies are delicious. A little pricey but worth the try! Recommend for smoothie: Pitaya and the Crave Smoothie."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Was craving an Acai bowl, and saw all the raves about this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. They did not disappoint. I had their regular acai bowl with their vegan smart vanilla protein powder added in. It was so good! I really liked the option of adding protein powder because I had never seen that before. I definitely will be coming back! Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Can't believe it has taken me this long to find this place!  As a vegan I felt out of luck looking for a great place to dine in Kendall.  Scrolling through Instagram I came upon a picture of the Frijoles bowl (my favorite food on the menu) I am glad I found it. ,It is a quick and go place so not restaurant but as the titles suggest it's a bar so just a few tables to dine. Staff was very friendly and made suggestions as it was my first time.  Staff also asked how was if my food selection was what i was expecting , showing how much they care about customers feedback.  The hours are not as convenient for me as a full time employee but gives me a reason to get up early on the weekends."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is such a godsend in kendall where there aren't many vegan/gluten free options (or even relatively healthy options for that matter). Only wish their hours of operation were a bit later. My favorite is the zucchini spaghetti!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I like this juice bar.  The dragon bowl and acai bowl are good.  The salads and smoothies are good too.  I just hate it's so far and in the middle of traffic armageddon lol.  But it is worth going to.  I had the avocado toast, it was ok.  Great place for vegans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,There's no better vegan spot in Miami than Roots. Best Pitaya Juices and bowls in town. The staff is beyond 5 stars. Highly recommended!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/30/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've been vegan now for 4 months and roots has made it so easy! I've been to roots now at least every other week and every visit has been an overall great experience. I've had almost everything on the menu but their breakfast has to be my favorite. Their bowls both the acai and dragon fruit are perfection and the avocado toast is heaven ! Their juices are also a great pick me up, I've had the ""got the beet"" but the ""rise and shine"" is my favorite. My work hours don't usually allow me to swing by for lunch but I've been able to try the fajita bowl and it was very filling the portion size was great and it was perfectly seasoned ! ,The food isn't the only thing I love about roots the ambiance really is what keeps me coming back. From the books put out for guests to read as they wait for their food to the cute foliage put out on the tables it all makes me want to spend my entire day there. On my last visit I saw that it was quite packed and I was very happy to see them doing so well I hope people continue to grow interest in health conscious food. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 starts is because I have heard from people I recommended Roots to that the customer service could be better and up to a certain extent I would have to agree. With that said though Roots is just what Kendall needed may their success be more than they ever expected !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/11/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is very good. There isn't any vegan places around Kendall so this is a great option. Around lunch time it gets packed because the place isn't big but the food truly is delicious. Their avocado toast is probably my favorite and their dragon bowl. They accept Apple Pay so it's convenient. They have very good pre-made juices and shots as well.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This is currently my favorite vegan restaurant in Miami. The bowls are delicious. The juices are phenomenal. The service is excellent. Just wish they had another location further east. Love love love it!!!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/25/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Well definitely a place with healthy food healthy options. Don't look anywhere else if you are vegan , organic , or looking for healthy food , this is the place . I like everything they have . Excellent juices and pita ! The chicken one and avocado are my favorite! But I'm sure they are all good , I tried their dressings really nice stuff , in general this is a little down to earth store serving excellent healthy food options. The ambience it's totally local and family oriented, I saw young students and kids all around of course the prices are also very reasonable . And good service even though they are always busy."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/29/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Walking through Coconut Grove and stumbled across this little hidden gem of a restaurant. I assumed by the name of this joint that it was vegan/vegetarian-friendly or a store for bunnies. To my luck they serve a pretty decent selection of smoothies, fresh drinks, salads, veggie sandwiches and more. ,Cool thing that stood out to me was that all their food was prepared fresh in front of you and you can pretty much smell the vegetables, fruits and breads they make on the spot. ,I wasn't too sure what to pick; fortunately there was this young lady that seemed to be a frequent guest of this restaurant and said it was her favorite in town. She was able to help me decide on what to order. Ended up getting the Baked Tofu Whole Wheat Pita Sandwich with Hummus Spread and a Grasshopper Juice. They brought with it some herbal paste and vinaigrette sauce that added a nice pop to the flavor of the sandwich. I've never been much of a tofu eater but this visit here may have changed that. The food is great, service was nice, convenient location, and my server hooked me up with a nice lil taster of the Açaí Smoothie since it was my first time trying out everything.,I was told you can't go wrong with whatever you select.!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/10/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"What mainly needs to be spoken about in this review is the extraordinary customer service given by each and every employee! So happy to have found a place who not only serves delicious, healthy, vegan food, but also values their customers!,I've driven passed this hidden gem a million times and have always wondered how their food must be. One day, strolling through Yelp I came across this spot and had to try.. best decision.,I ordered a grasshopper juice with added ginger. Deliciousness!!!! The ginger isn't normally added, but I requested it for those added health benefits.,I also enjoyed a vegan bean burger in a pita.. finger licking good! - I will definitely be returning very soon!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I ordered the solid white chicken sandwich with the whole wheat pita, and my sister ordered their regular garden salad. The food was nothing out of this world, it was okay. The service wasn't great either, the guy took forever to attend us even though he noticed we were standing there for about 15 minutes and aside from the fact that he didn't notice, when he came up to us he wasn't the friendliest. I can definitely say that if you're looking into any vegan/healthy places, this isn't the ideal place to go."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/9/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Fast, friendly, and delicious! Definitely a local hangout, this spot offers the BEST healthy and vegan friendly food options. As a huge meat lover myself I usually feel unsatisfied if my meal doesn't have at least some type of protein in it, but the last carrot does their wraps/pitas so well that it's just as filling and extremely satisfying. ,Don't forget to ask for the green vinaigrette sauce, it's absolutely delicious and will make even the biggest veggie hater eat all of their veggies! ,The juices and smoothies are all made fresh and taste great. My personal favorite is the grasshopper which is pineapple juice with a shot of wheatgrass. ,Prices are fair and staff is great. Would highly recommend if you're looking for something healthy but also satisfying"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/18/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Cute little place we ran into. Healthy choices. Mostly salads and sandwiches, but hearty sandwiches. I was with a vegan and the server, young kid, took the time to explain the dressings, the veggies and even gave us a recommendation for something not on the menu. Well we went with that. Falafel with some secret green sauce - that if we could have just had a bucket this review would be longer. The young kid really made this place even nicer. Real down to earth and attentive. Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Kendall has a hot new vegan spot. Good location and easy to reach.,Their salads are so fresh and made with a great combo of ingredients. ,Prices are good except for their $8 per juice. $5 is what they should go for.,I still give them 5-stars because the food is so good and this is a true ""healthy vegetarian"" place since so many other vegan restaurants have so many carb-filled bread and pasta dishes where this place focuses on vegetables and beans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/19/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this place. Great salad, lentil bowl, vegan deserts, and juices. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is a positive vibe."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/13/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I come to this place as often as I possibly can! They never disappoint and they have such a friendly staff! My staples here are The Crave smoothie, the Acai bowl, and the Avocado Toast ! Also, if it's available, a slice of their vegan carrot cake is my obsession!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Quality quality quality!!!! This is one of the very few all natural all organic all vegan places in Kendall. It's easy to tell it's in high demand because they always have a line out the door! I always order ahead but there food and smoothies are amazing and definitely worth the money! Feels like you're doing your body good! Get more locations!!! Or a bigger space!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem quite daunting and complicated. For me it's about making one change at a time and not all at once. This vegan friendly restaurant is my go-to the days I don't feel creative in the kitchen or right out have no clue what I'm going to cook that day. It's a 20 minute drive from my home but well worth it. There are no words to describe how good everything on the menu is and I mean everything!! My favorites are the Dragon Bowl for breakfast and Zoodles Bowl for lunch. If you want to feel brand new eat @ Roots. Your body will definitely thank you!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this vegan juice bar/ cafe. They have great options are different types of juice and healthy snack juices like acai bowl, dragon bowl, quinoa bowl and avocado toast. Not only the food is delicious, people are friendly, it's a perfect Instagram spot as well. ;),I tried the dragon bowl, it's huge and sosososo good! I didn't expect a layer of granola at the bottom too. Love it! The granola is no generic, full of flavor and various seeds. ,Will come back to try other stuff for sure!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love roots juice bar, it's one of my favorite places to eat usually on Sunday's for lunch (They changed their times and they're opened every day now which is a plus!).I usually get the lentil bowl, and it comes with brown rice and a side of veggies. I have tried most of their food bowls on their menu, and all of them are delicious! Their vegan chocolate cake is amazing! Also, they do have signs by the register that states that food may take up to 20 mins just because their food is served fresh, so there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Excellent vegan place!! The food is great and very healthy. The avocado toast is amazing and every dish is fresh and delicious. I wish there are more Roots locations. A must!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I received an add from Yelp, telling me about healthy eating places near me, so I decided to give this place a try, I'm not really a vegan but really enjoy healthy foods. Wanting to give his local place a try I ordered a few things, Dragon bowl... delicious, Morning Bagel... WOW, Lentil bowl....double WOW, I also decided to try the Avocado Toast because all the reviews ranted about it, I think it was too salty, a little less salty & I think it will be great. Overall the food was a total success, I will definitely be coming back to try some more items from their menu"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I came out to Miami during my sister's best friend's wedding. This place happened to be next to the hotel we were staying at, so I decided why not give this place a try? This is a raw vegan restaurant and juice bar, although they cook their food. For my meal I had the zucchini noodles with vegan Bolognese and a green soup. I really enjoyed the zucchini pasta (zoodles) because they really fill you up and trick your brain into thinking your eating spaghetti. The Vegan Bolognese was very thick and chunky in consistency like its traditional meat counterpart. My green soup was very well seasoned and I could appreciate the distinct taste of broccoli in it. The staff here are incredibly friendly. The day I came in, the place was packed with a line out the door and despite this the nice girl at the counter stopped what she was doing for a moment and gave me a knife when I asked for one. I don't go to Miami very much, but if I do, I will be sure to stop by here again to try more of their items!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been hesitant to try this place due to the location being in a very heavy traffic area. Recently I stopped by for the first time and I was really impressed with the place. I ordered a dragon fruit smoothie, a bagel with vegan cream cheese and a vegetable soup and everything was delicious. Making a healthy vegetable soup is hard to do and they do it so well. I love that they use organic ingredients and environmentally friendly to go packaging. This is a great spot if you're looking for a healthy or organic option."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"One of my favorite vegan spots in south miami. My favorite is the bean bowl and zucchini pasta. Not once have I been disappointed when I go to this place. Everything from the juice, smoothies, food and dessert never disappoints. Very attentive staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/9/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing service . Staff had excellent knowledge of everything and let us try different fruit because adding it in the smoothie. This is a hole in the wall because I would've never noticed if it was for a friend who recently went from vegetarian to vegan and wanted to try this from Yelp reviews. ,It's very peaceful and quiet. Parking says 1 hour only."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great Vegan Friendly options. Very clean and friendly staff.  Food was really tasty. I recommend the Quinua Bowl, the Bean Bowl, and the Açaí bowl."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super fresh and tasty. Made me feel more alive when I ate this food. Great variety and high quality food. Definitely one of the best vegan/vegetarian spots in this area. Wish that there was more space to sit inside.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/26/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The customer service and cleanliness of this place is impeccable. Loved its all plant-based menu. It's a must-go for vegans and vegetarians in the Kendall area.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"A solid 4.5 stars...This juice bar is exactly what West Kendall needed. Its fast, delicious, convenient, and vegan. It's tucked away in a shopping center behind a hotel so it's hard to find. But no worries, plug it in your GPS and it takes you right there. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Very simple and inviting décor. They have an array of juices and smoothies. Their food menu is small but definitely not lacking in flavor. All the menu items are plant based and for the most part organic. ,I tried: ,Avocado toast: The flavor was delicious. I just wish the avocado had thicker chunks and not have so much of a creamy consistency. The addition of the chia seeds were exceptional and gave it the final touch. ,Vegetable soup: Once again amazing flavor but I felt all I got were blended vegetables. I like when there is heartiness in my soup and I can actually crunch on a vegetable or two. ,Dragonfruit Acai Bowl: O.M.G! Best bowl I have ever had! Hands down. The toppings were so delicious. Banana, strawberry, kiwi, blueberries, coconut chips, granola, and chia seeds decorated the bowl beautifully and sat on top of the perfectly blended dragon fruit. Its a must order. ,and last but not least....The wonderful Lentil Bowl: I loved this so much. The lentils were so so so good! I tip my hat off to the wonderful person who seasoned this dish so beautifully. This bowl comes with a heeping serving of lentils, brown rice, and grilled vegetables. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Portions were the perfect size. ,I will definitely be coming back to this location. I know for sure I will be ordering The dragonfruit bowl and the Lentil Bowl. Two delicious concoctions that are worth trying! ,Cannot wait to try their juices. ,P.S. parking can be a bit of a pain. Don't fret, when you drive into the small plaza there is more parking if you keep driving straight."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love this place! I am excited to find places like this (Vegan/Vegetarian options!) in Miami / Kendall area! The atmosphere is very nice, have many options on their menu. I had the Quinoa bowl and Love potion (beet, pineapple, pear, ginger, chia) juice!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So i'm not vegan or even health-conscious over my food, but after having a friend talk my ear off about how much she was craving an acai bowl, i decided i must try one for myself. ,Roots is not at all on my way. I happened to be in the area and Yelp recommended them when i searched for a local Juice Bar. ,Let me tell you, i am so glad i stopped in here. The atmosphere is adorable: trendy white couch, stool seating along the windows, and a communal picnic table with an artificial tree sprouting in the middle. There's open cooler with fresh beds of wheatgrass, their pressed and bottled juices, and other assorted drinks. The kitchen is partially visible from the register so you can see most goings-on with your food. Their menu can be found on clipboards all around the shop so ordering is more expedient. ,I ordered the Acai Bowl and their Lentil Bowl. Immediately, the young woman said I made good choices but that it would be a lot of food if it was all just for me. I absolutely loved that. I let her know that I was planning on eating the Lentil Bowl later in the day, and asked if it would keep until then. She rang me up and said she'd fulfill the acai bowl order first and whenever i felt it was a good time to go, she'd fulfill the lentil bowl order so i could leave with the freshest food.,The Acai Bowl was the first i've ever had, and i may have ruined myself for any other. Their portions are large and filling; their toppings are liberal and a real treat. The bowl had a multitude of toppings, but also the bottom of the bowl had a generous layer of granola and chia seeds. It was definitely my happiest food experience in 2016. Every spoonful was savored and by the time i was near finished, a gentlemen had dropped off a warm brown bag with my lentil bowl. ,So in the end, I've been trying to give myself an excuse to get back into this area and stop by Roots again. 5/5 in everything: quality, service, value. No other bowls have met my standards."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/4/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,So far I have been here twice and each time I really did enjoy it. The first time around I ordered a smoothie and the avocado toast. My husband and I really enjoyed both. The second time around we did have one of their bowls which was pretty tasty. I do like the vibe in there. It can be a little to warm in there though. I definitely plan on going back again. It is a great healthy option regardless if you are vegan or vegetarian or not.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts. 100%recommended."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Best vegan/healthy food in town. I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Incredible. Shared the fajita bowl (without the spicy peppers), avocado toast, and a butternut squash soup and it was AMAZING! Even my non-vegan family member thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back.,Also, the presentation was so cute! I'm just digging everything about it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/20/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Such a cute little juice bar! I live in the area but only recently heard about it. When I heard there was an a vegan all plant-based foodie heaven near me I was all about it. I didn't want to get my hopes up as far as taste because I feel I am really picky. I ordered the lentil bowl and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. The lentil bowl comes with brown rice, broccoli, zucchini and carrots - can't complain. I'll be back to try juice and breakfast bagel."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/15/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been working on going vegan for some time now and the food here is AMAZING! I am a fan of the dragon fruit bowl, coffee, and fajita bowl! They are expensive but most health food places are so it is expected. ,I have to take out two stars, not because of the food (which I encourage everyone to go try), but because of the customer service. I have realized they are becoming more popular and now are much more frantic, making more mistakes and, even making rude comments at times.  Many times, when I call in to place an order to avoid waiting in the crowded little seating area, they don't pick up. I recently mentioned this to one of the employees (I think he could have been the manager, but I am not sure), and he told me ""I can't do 5 things at once!"" I think they lack a little bit of professionalism, but it's still great food in a convenient area close to where I live. so mehhhh..."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/21/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is right by school and it's pretty great. It is only vegan so they do not have many options although I love vegan foods. I got a avocado/kale salad of some sort with a spicy sauce. That was delicious! Downside part of this place is the wait and how busy it gets! A tip would probably be to open up earlier
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Ok, so I had not tried an Acai bowl because as most things are now in days I thought it was a fad hipster dish. I thought it's a smoothie in a bowl how great can that be...OMG WAS I WRONG. Yes, to some people it's still a fad to go vegan because that is the cool thing now in days, I'm not vegan but I do have a plant based diet day a week. The acai bowl is toooo die for. I can die and go to heaven now, so so so good! I don't even have words to describe the perfection that the acai bowl is. I'm going to try the avocado toast next time I come here."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Please visit this place whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, you will fall in love with the food, açaí bowls as well as the cozy, coffee shop ambience. Try the frijoles bowl and the avocado toast."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super good Vegan place in West Kendall. Try the bowls and the juices. The avocado toast is super delicious as well. #savetheanimals
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is pretty awesome. Their menu ranges from options of lentil soups, to sandwiches, salads, juices, energy bowls, and anything in between. It's a vegan's heaven. It is a bit pricey, but that expected at most of these health and ethically conscious restaurants. I still have a ton of meals to try out on their menu, and so far I've loved their lentils, dragon bowls, avocado toast, juices, smoothies, and a few other options-basically everything has been great thus far. ,I like to come here often, usually whenever I'm in the Kendall area. Whenever I bike or drive out to the Kendall Regal Village, I like to grab a bite to eat here if I'm hungry, especially if I have just finished a workout at the LA Fitness, or finished a film at the theater, or finished picking up art supplies at Michael's, or have been spending my afternoon at Barnes & Nobles. Honestly this little mall plaza has just about everything I love, and it's my own personal escape on Kendall Drive. So the location of this vegan restaurant just makes it that much better. I used to come here a lot more back when I worked in the area, but I still come here often enough because of my gym membership and the other stores. I'm surprised it took so long for me to write a review. ,Parking is free and it's a private lot. There's also bike parking, so it's perfect. And free wifi! So between here and the Barnes & Nobles, it's a great location to study or read if you want to get a change of scenery from the library or your house. ,The staff is friendly and I enjoy their service. No complaints. You do get 20% off of your purchase on check-in, so keep that handy! ,I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here, as I've been trying to introduce him to more vegan options and vegan restaurants. It's difficult to convince him because he eats meat and is stubborn, but when I come with him I will recommend he gets one of their higher calorie/higher protein options, since that's his main hesitation to vegan food-he thinks it's not enough calories or protein for the price, especially for someone like him who is trying to gain weight. *sigh* There are plenty of options for everyone, even for those who work out and are looking for plant based protein.  ,Overall it's a great experience, tasty and healthy vegan food, great location and convenience of being right off Kendall Drive, and free bike and car parking. Did I mention how that is so perfect? They take card and cash, too. I only wish they stayed open later."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/9/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I yelped ""salads"" and this place popped up. On the drive there, I was excited to have found a place like this in Kendall (when I think juice bar and vegan, I think Miami Beach). The cashier was kind and made a suggestion for my order. I am always happy to hear suggestions, especially when it's my first time. I ordered a caramel macchiato (with almond milk--as per her recommendation) and it was delicious! Not bitter, not overly sweet. I also ordered an avocado toast--light yet satisfying. I tend to go overboard with new things so I fully intend to go back tomorrow to try a smoothie! ,My one complaint is how tiny the space is! There isn't much space to wait for your meal if it's to go. If you choose to dine-in, the seating is very VERY limited. Granted, this was lunch time so I completely understand. I will return during non-peak hours."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Being a vegan, I can tell you this place is a great spot! They have delicious food bowls, my favorite being the Dragon bowl! They also have several other lunch items that are extremely tasty and fresh, I would definitely recommend the zoodles and avocado toast... their desserts are also amazing, most of them are vegan and again, very very tasty! I have tried several of their smoothies and they are also very fresh, made to order, and absolutely delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/12/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is Vegan but you don't need to be Vegan to eat here! This place's menu is EXTREMELY good. I have been there more than 12 times this year alone (it's a little far from my house but if i could go more I would) The açaí bowls are so refreshing and make you feel satisfyingly full because of how healthy it is. The peanut butter smoothie is fantastic (I'm not really a big fan of peanut butter but I still get it) the people are always welcoming and sweet. I really enjoy the environment as well, it's a cute little place and you can sit around outside as well. This is my favorite place to eat. I'm not the healthiest person in the world but I really do crave the açaí bowls often."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am writing this review purely from the point of view as a customer, I used to work here a year ago and I will not relate my work experience to the establishment... The menu has a nice variety of choices to get, my favorite are the wellness smoothie (a fresh tasting green smoothie) and the crave smoothie(vanilla/cinnamon goodness). Another favorite of mine are the zoodles (zuccinni  noodles), they are served with a vegan bolognese sauce. I used to use the Yelp check in/20% off when I would come here but now they are saying they aren't accepting it anymore. If that is the case, take it off Yelp because it is misleading. This visit I ordered an avocado toast and a crave smoothie. The toast came out quickly but 15 minutes later I'm still here waiting for my smoothie while the girls behind the counter chat about stair masters and working out, usually they bring the food all together. As of customer service, associates could be friendlier maybe try smiling. Vegan = HAPPY"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/23/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,the time to get the food  it is my only concern...every thing else it is GOOODD AND FRESH.. i highly recommended to any vegan friends
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not vegan by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I do love my smoothies & bowls and Roots delivers on both! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl. I've had Dragon/Pitaya bowls around the US and even internationally. And in my opinion Roots' version is the best. All the toppings work well together and everything is o nicely presented. ,I have also tried their juice cleanse 2x. I do pretty well on 3 day cleanses with rarely a headache. They will offer suggestions on how to deal with any effects. The first time, I received all clear juices. The 2nd time, I received some of the same juices plus one thicker juice and one cash mylk. I think that the addition of the thicker drinks should help those that have a hard time with cleanses as the thicker juices/mylk are pretty filling.  ,The avocado juice was delish and the cash mylk was also tasty. I do not like celery and three of the juices contain celery. The green ones I chugged. While the beet juice was more palatable. I loved the morning juice.  Mind you, this is just my personal opinion. All in all, it was a great cleanse.,I have been coming here since it was the place for the best cuppie cakes on the planet (cough, cough). And the staff and owners have always been super friendly and welcoming. The shop is so cute and offers seating both inside & out. Orders are prepared once placed so if you are in a rush, you can place your order online right here on Yelp! And it will be ready for you to pick up."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Hands down my favorite Vegan Food Spot in Miami! My favorite thing is the ""Fajitas Bowl"" and the Love Potion #9 Juice. I also like the Frijoles Bowl and Dragon Fruit Bowl. The place is small but I love it inside. The atmosphere is good and everything is made to order so it tastes very fresh. I hope that they open up more restaurants in the near future and they should really think about opening on Sundays."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Roots is a very tasty juice bar, it has all the vegan favorites. I'm not vegan but I do like from time to time a healthy alternative. ,One of my side jobs is next door so it makes a nice and convenient meal/shake for me during my lunch break. ,I usually have my favorite the PB&j shake. Very tasty and full of flavor. ,If you've never had Avo bread before make sure you ask for it. It's tasteful and light! It'll sure make your tastebuds happy. ,If in the area and looking for something healthy and different try Roots out. It's sure not to disappoint"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/9/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,My go-to place for acai/dragon bowls and healthy vegan food. Everything I've tried was delicious. The place is also very cute and simple and the service is great.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/3/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely love the acai bowls from roots. They are reasonably priced, have tons of toppings and tastes delicious! The shop is really nice and clean inside, however, it is kind of small which makes it feel very cramped when it is very busy. There's not so many places to sit so I always opt for take out. The best way to do take out here is to either call ahead or order through yelp because there's not too much space to wait around if it's very busy. Made that mistake once and felt super claustrophobic. There isn't that much seating, there's a little community table which is cute but when the line gets long it feels like people are right on top of you. The decorations and style of the place are cute though. Definitely a cute little spot to hang out if it's not busy but if it is I would come back later or do take out. The food is definitely worth it though. It's one of the only vegan/juice bars in the area that have fresh fruits and are good quality without being overpriced."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Delicious place! Smoothies are alright, but let me tel you! THAT FAJITA BOWL WAS AMAZING!!! Prices were pretty average for a juice bar, not bad. staff was very friendly and attentive and hardworking! This place is a beautiful place spreading the vegan message. I like the steps towards being more green. Also I love that they had vegan smoothie bowls! Food was good, the smoothie was just what I needed!"

Whoever is the owner really did a good job when hiring the chef. Also, I would like to know which coffee do you use? Where is it from? Because I enjoyed it! I have tried almost each one of the meals in their menu and have liked all of them!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"GO TO ROOTS JUICEBAR! I have tried almost every vegan place in Miami and Roots is by far, my favorite place to eat at. Compare all the prices for an acai bowl between every vegan place and look back at Roots. It is very affordable and their food will fill you up. They have a variety of meals and smoothies, which makes them my go-to when I am near kendall. I am excited for their new location opening in Doral."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Very clean great smoothies great juices. Great food . Highly recommend vegan or vegaterian or just healthy. I have been here a few times now and the food is always delicious. I love the lentil bowl, and you get so much! It is a little expensive but these types of places always seem to be. Love that the menu is all vegan, makes it so easy to order.Had the kale juice and a comfort bowl for my wife. They were both good. ,PS: Pet friendly."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First time customer, went in for the Açaí bowl but they were out. Chose the Dragon bowl instead--very appealing to the eyes and delicious to the palate, and very filling too. The music played there was a little too loud if trying to have a conversation with friends, but otherwise a perfect place to hangout. Love the vegan themed art & decor. Friendly staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOVE! The food is delicious, nutritious and eco-friendly. The service is super fast and friendly and the environment/ decor is awesome (they always play the best music too). I am a huge fan of their menu, which is 100% vegan (and I'm not even vegan). I highly recommend the frijoles bowl, the morning bagel and the dragon bowl...YUM! Also, if you're ever feeling sick, take one of their ""good and well"" natural juice shots. It has cayenne pepper in it, so if you're not comfortable with spice, you may want to stay away. But seriously, I've started taking these shots when I'm sick and they make me feel SO much better! Overall, a great go-to place for delicious, healthy, feel-good food and great service."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I honesty have to thank the owner for this change. I remembered this place having sweets and I had no Idea I had a vegan friendly restaurant right around the corner. I am transitioning into veganism after getting educated and realizing the damaging affects of processed foods, meats and dairy. Was so happy to find out the food was not only delicious but wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. I love the story of this place and the fact that it cares about what they provide you with. The juices are expensive yes but do have a blend of a lot of different things that help your nutrition . I'm your new loyal customer and can't wait to order more meals throughout my week! ,Thank you! :),P.S. Please make a loyalty program!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I went for the first time today and I'm definitely going back! I loved all the vegan options! Considering most vegan places are on the pricier end, I didn't think this place was so bad. I had the Pitaya smoothie with dragon fruit, mango banana etc. this vibrant drink was tasty and very filling. I can't wait to go and try some of their food."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/11/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First I'd like to make clear that I am NOT a vegan, and I had no idea this was a vegan place, but that didn't deter me from trying out their smoothies. They clearly have a fan base, because at 930 AM when they open there was already lines. , I decided to try a Crave smoothie consisting of Vanilla bean, dates, bananas, cinnamon, chia seeds, cacao and Almond milk. It wasn't bad. I also ordered the Breakfast Bagel with Cashew Cream cheese and spinach on a wheat bagel. I knew I would like the bagel, because I love anything with Cashew, I wasn't crazy about the spinach but I ate it anyways ( my first time ever eating spinach) , I respect other people's choices of what they put in their bodies, but I couldn't live on a vegan diet. It's a very nice small place with lots of employees, the service was friendly and I can see myself returning to try some of their cold pressed juices.,I tried their cold pressed juices and I didn't care for them. Ginger is too overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the RISE & SHINE Juice. ,Also I wonder why ""healthy"" food is so expensive if it doesn't contain many of the preservatives and ingredients as ""unhealthy"" food does. I imagine less ingredients less spendings."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/17/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,I love this place. Be good is always fresh and delicious.  Açaí bowls are fabulous and the cakes are scrumptious. Nice place you can sit inside or outside.  Everything is Vegan!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was introduced to this place today, and I am so happy I was! The location itself is a bit hidden, but the food was delicious. When I saw the menu, I got super excited because I am always looking for new vegetarian/vegan friendly places that serve fresh, tasty food. ,The cashier recommended the quinoa bowl,,and it did not disappoint! Quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, avocado, tomatoes, broccoli, and more in what tasted like a basil pesto type sauce. Yummmm! ,I will definitely be back to try more!!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/1/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Been coming here more because I've been training for work next door. They have great vegan options which makes it great for people who go plant based.,I have had their lentils and frijoles bowl for lunch and they were good but wasn't satisfying for my cravings. The food was very filling and nutritious. The portion was also good enough to share with 2 people. Smoothies are great too. They aren't loaded with sugar and have tons of antioxidants.,My favorite there would be the acai bowl. It has varieties of fruit other than strawberries and bananas. The granola is nice and crunchy and adds the perfect amount of sweetness. They also have almonds and toasted coconut flakes which give each bit a different taste. The serving size is pretty large and can be shared with 2 people. The price I would say is still pricey.,I am now giving them a 4 of 5 because of their philosophy. They are purely plant based and believe in high quality ingredients."

This place was a staple not just because they had veg options, but they're awesome. Pretty much all my Miami friends love this place, and most aren't vegan/vegetarian. Best falafel sandwiches, hands down. I've been in NYC for 13 years now, and this place is still my favorite falafel joint."

"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/3/2016,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,Mister Block was really cool and situated in a little corner of wynwood. If you aren't looking you might miss it. The decor is trendy and there is plenty of outdoor seating. They also have lots of vegan pastries to choose from. The coffee was quick and delicious and presented in a cute mr block cup. Definitely will be back!
"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/18/2018,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,"I came to try this little coffee shop out and I got to say I truly enjoyed myself. I came to do some work and the ladies were lovely and kind. They make you feel very welcomed. They truly gave me the ""Wynwood"" vibe. I ordered just a basic hazelnut latte with coconut milk and it hit the spot. They have plenty of drinks they offer. Also my fellow vegan friends they have food for us too! They also offer free phone charging outside of the front door. It's a little hidden off the main st but it's perfect to have a little hideaway spot. Thank you! This place is definitely a gem."
"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/1/2017,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,"So Ive been around Wynwood block and I'm sad that I didn't come to Mister Block Cafe sooner. I heard about their vegan icecream sandwiches so I decided to come here instead of Panther.,Wow their coffee was great! I got the tap cold brew coffee, and he put hazelnut in mines. The coffee tap is right next to the register so I got to see how it bubbled. I loved it! My friend ordered the iced matcha latte, and that tasted amazing too.,Also- they do coffee ripple which is foam designs which can be customized. It was such a different and cool addition. I kinda just wanted to keep it and never drink it.,Oh! To get back to the icecream sandwich that brought me here. The vegan flavor was vanilla rice flavor, almonds, sandwiched in chocolate chip almond cookies. It was really really good. ,Seriously guys, come here. Its worth it."

Food was delicious, staff friendly and prices reasonable, though portions were a bit on the smaller side. There are even a few vegan options available. I had the Curry roasted vegetable bowl, which was very good though it had one dissonant garnish (basil). Overall, a great experience and I am glad we have it as anew option in South Miami. Will definitely be coming back!"

Food is also delicious. Good music too. Place is great for family, friends, casual dates, etc."
"5958 S Dixie Hwy, South Miami, FL 33143",6/27/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,I happen to stumble upon this place after driving daily by it as I live down the street. Finally came in one day to try it out and haven't stopped coming since. I am vegan and it is difficult to find good places with vegan options in Miami. It's gotten better but many yummy vegan places are on the beach or other neighborhoods further from me. The bean bowl is my favorite and Jake is also my favorite! He always makes my experience full of joy and pleasant and his smile is contagious! New favorite go to for sure :)
"5958 S Dixie Hwy, South Miami, FL 33143",7/10/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,"Easily one of my new favorites, especially when you're looking for healthier options. Located in the new area of South Miami, there is ample street parking and this place is huge, lots of seating available. When you walk in you head straight towards the counter and place your order, they give you a buzzer and you collect your order when the buzzer rings. Overall the food is tasty, fresh and they have a variety of vegan and vegetarian options."

After sitting down and exploring the menu, I asked our waiter what he recommended for a vegan, and he unhesitatingly offered me an array of detailed suggestions. I highly recommend the corn fritters without sour cream (sub the feta-filled guacamole with avocado). And their cappuccino with almond milk was delicious :) Great staff. Beautiful ambience. I'm definitely looking forward to returning!"
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/25/2017,$$,5,Threefold Cafe,"We've been there twice. Sunday about 11:00am and there's a line out the door. It'll be fabulous once Giralda construction is complete and it will have foot traffic only. Brianna our adorable server came up with a vegan platter for me: sautéed spinach, roasted tomatoes, sliced avocado, hashbrowns and Zack's Bakery bread, along with an almond milk latté.  All delicious."
"141 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/3/2017,$$,3,Threefold Cafe,"I have been to Threefold multiple times now, and every time I leave, I always feel the same. The food is good and fresh, but it never feels worth the bill I get at the end. I definitely think it's a bit overpriced for what you get. This time around, I had the chai tea latte which was great and the phenomenal fungi. Now, I am a mushroom lover and I've had this dish before, but this time it felt like there were way too many mushrooms, not enough goat cheese, and for the price and amount of mushrooms, I really wish they'd give two pieces of bread instead of just one. ZTB bread is the best! My sister got the same but without the goat cheese as she tries to eat mainly vegan..vegans beware, there aren't a ton of options and many of the dishes specifically say they cannot be modified. My mom had the waffles, which she enjoyed, but nothing I couldn't make at home myself. Again, the food is good... just missing that extra something that makes you leave saying Wow! That was amazing! And not caring what the price tag was."

A gem tucked next to Publix, Jasmine's has easily made my list of top restaurants to return to. I have had birthday and graduation gatherings here because nothing feels more celebratory to me than their tofu massaman curry. I have yet to try tofu as flavorful as theirs, making them a great vegan / vegetarian friendly option. Their lunch prices are very cheap with great portion sizes. It's a great trip to feel fully satisfied at a low cost.,The owner, Richard, is also friendly and approachable. He acknowledges his regulars and makes conversation to make them feel at home. His team is very fast and friendly, and they already know by now that I'm ordering their delicious curry whenever I visit. Their veggie rolls are delicious as well, and my family has enjoyed every time we have come."

Try any of the shakes delicious and filing. as some of the food is not very filling since its all vegan. the lentils were very good also. was able to shop for some organic products while i was there. great shop, great service."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/20/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Best healthy food option in the neighborhood and usually packed at lunchtime as they offer homemade vegan dishes and have inside seating available.  A little pricey as i usually spend between $10-15 for lunch and a drink, but well worth it.  They also have everything under the sun to whole food multi-vitamins, raw chocolate, organic juices, books on healthy lifestyles, and even a talented musician comes in and plays on certains days for the lunch crowd.  They're also very informative and helpful with any questions you may have."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/18/2014,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"I had the vegan chicken empanada, good with their hot sauce.  I also had their pasta.  It tasted fresh, great marinara sauce, but it was microwaved.  That machine should not be in a health food store.  Overall good experience.  I'll be back.  $10"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/6/2011,$$,5,The Honey Tree,With not too many vegetarian places around The Honey Tree is a gem. Go for lunch or even just to grab a few healthy snacks. They have vegan cookies and other baked goods that Taste great. Great tasting lunches and a selection of healthy drinks. Live healthy.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2009,$$,4,The Honey Tree,Lunch: around noon (12:30-3:30) but they also save leftover if you run too early or late. Food tasts realy fresh and amazing. Great cakes (some are vegan) and a nice place to buy food and more healthy product.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/20/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Every time I am in this area, I always try to stop here for lunch.  It opens around Noon and they serve lunch until they run out, which is by 2pm.  They have a variety of healthy soups, salads, and main courses that are prepared by the owner and his family, on site, daily.  You go to the counter and tell them what you want and the amount you want.  I suggest you try a variety of dishes.  Then they weight your plate and that is what you pay.  It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for - a great, home cooked, healthy lunch.  There are several tables inside for dining.  It can get pretty busy around lunchtime.  I wish they had outdoor seating as well.  They also sell a variety of bottled drinks, healthy organic grocery items, organic lotions, and aromatherapy items.  It is much more personalized than Whole Foods and with a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to eat clean, vegetarian, or vegan."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Healthy, homemade vegan cuisine at its best. I love that they have different options, almost in a cafeteria-style line, available on weekdays. If only they could start offering dinner, I would certainly come back here more often! ,The store itself is very small, better to take the food to go, and offers only a minimal amount of grocery items. ,Great place for a quick office lunch to go."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",4/28/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,Totally recommend this vegan haven. Or anyone that cares about ingredients or just good food. Friendly staff and the owner is more than likely always there. Not enough seating during busy lunch time hours and not enough parking. But well worth the wait!

The store clerk emerged in vitriol --- a blank stare --- I thought I was going to be hanged on 'The Honey Tree' (wherever it's hidden).,There's a counter towards the back where they make juices and homemade-vegan food, plus a small area where you can sit, chat, and have bite of some of their delicacies.,I had a portion of their lasagna --- wait that has dairy, what?,Okay, it wasn't lasagna.,What tasted like lasagna was actually just zucchini, tomato sauce, and roasted peppers.  ,These Vegans really do well in duping the uninformed."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"My rating is based just on the food and juice bar, as the other items I find expensive.  For the lunch bar, the food is fairly priced, fresh and delicious.  Most places in Miami that offer healthy vegan and vegetarian food are not so gourmet and usually cost your whole weeks income.  Loving the Honey Tree right now for a day when I want to go get some good wholesome food and stay under $8 usually.  They change the menu daily so there is always a new dish to try, and huge selection of juices and smoothies to keep you from getting bored."

"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Lunch buffet is reasonably priced and there is alot to choose from. The food is in the back of the store and upfront they sell vegan products like soap, shampoo etc. I didn't buy anything from the store but I'd go back based off the food."

The Honey Tree is a small natural food store with a cafe in the back offering daily made vegetarian and vegan specialties. ,I went on a Wednesday, which luckily is lasagna day at the Honey Tree. They had two types of lasagnas - regular with vegetarian ""beef,"" and gluten free with vegan cheese. Both were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. They also have tons of other food options daily, as well as a smoothie bar. ,My favorite part is that they have a different vegan cake every day, and they're all delicious. Sometimes I go just to pick up a slice!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Delicious vegan fresh food sold by the pound! I was there for lunch and had experienced their daily buffet! :) I had a dish full of food including veggie rice, asparagus, kale, potatoes with spinach, veggie quesadilla, shaved Brussels sprouts, and avocado salad ($13.32).  Also, i added a veggie spring roll ($3.50) for lunch. For dessert, I took a fruit salad with almond cluster to go which was delicious ($6.99). The fruita included papaya, mango, starfruit, kiwi, and pineapple. I ate so much and was definitely satisfied! Will most definitely come back! Also! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Finally, parking is freeeee which is a nice perk!"

They have a limited amount, lunch only so If your interested don't come late afternoon or you'll be disappointed.  I feel like I'm really feeding my body well when I'm here. Yummy too."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",2/4/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Food is exquisitely fresh, vegan, and delicious.  They bring in prepared salads, quiches, and soups at around 11:30 AM, and they serve until it runs out.  You stand at the counter and point to which you would like to try, and they scoop it onto a plate and weigh it.  They often sell out of items like the tofu-spinach quiche because folks place phone orders to reserve a slice (sooo good!  Don't slam tofu quiche until you try it!).,I had roasted butternut squash, roasted broccolini, marinated portobello slices, a competent tomato/avocado salsa, and a cucumber-mint salad with chick peas.  My friend let me taste the quiche and I ended up eating half of it.  We finished the meal by splitting a fresh vegan, gluten-free strawberry cake, and it was soft, sweet, and pretty.,They also make juices and smoothies and have lots of vegan baked goodies that look scrumptious.  Did not shop the market, but it looks pretty well stocked.,The genuine, tie-dyed hippie staff are extremely nice and quirky.  Stay away if you're wearing Lululemon and a sneer.  The price for lunch was certainly more expensive than a burger and fries- but this is  real honest cooking served with warmth.  You'll leave feeling nourished, body and soul."

They provide a white dressing which was very tasty which I poured on my wrap.. delish! Also, they offer a ""box lunch"" which includes rice & beans & your choice of protein for $9.  They sell soft drinks & water to ease it all down. Great spot to grab a tasty but quick lunch!"
"50 SW 10th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/1/2018,$$,5,Rice House of Kabob,"Our company ordered catering for about 30 people for 3 events last month. Our staff loved the food... Every last bit was enjoyed and everyone had rave reviews after each event. It was great that the combination of food had something for everyone, whether omnivore or vegan! It was much preferred over the usual sandwiches we typically cater. The ordering process was very easy as well. The staff helped us figure out exactly what we needed and how much. Overall it was a great experience, and we would definitely order again."

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Normally ""Vegan"" is code for ""Taste like shoes leather"", but not at GLAM.  Chef Todd is a Miami legend, all his spots are on point and his food is ridiculous.  This dude beat the breaks off Bobby Flay, and he does the same to these vegetables.  Its 100 degrees out and I'm chugging this carrot soup like Ive been in desert or something.  This guy has me eating cashew cheese on the reg now.  And don't even get me started with these jackfruit dishes homie.  Can't give this place enough stars.  And tell them Miguel sent you... they don;t know me, but its nice to get the name out there you know."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/8/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Soooooo good!!!!! I'm vegan and in love. Amazing food in a nice little place. Miami needs more vegan restaurants and more vegan restaurants like Glam. Would rate it 6 stars if I could.

Its like your stepping into a cute little oasis from one of those unique shows on the cooking channel. Just what downtown needed! Support local products, teas, and bakers. EVERYTHING in their menu is delicious!!! Only wished they had more vegan and gluten free options and desserts. But its ok because their food is so good and refreshing. Not heavy or greasy like everything in the city surrounding it. The best part is their costumer service! The owners are extremely nice and the ambiance/energy makes you want to stay forever. ,The chocolate chip cookie&veggi wrap -must haves"
"11327 South Dixie Hwy, Pinecrest, FL 33156",7/20/2018,$$,3,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,"I liked that this place offered a lot of veggie options for vegans/vegetarians, but I'm not sure that I would go here again because the menu is (understandably) catered to a meat loving crowd. ,I ordered the cold spicy tofu and kimchi as starters. The topping on the tofu had a nice crunch to it and was the best thing I had that night. The kimchi tasted like kimchi you can buy in jar from a grocery store. It was sour (which is okay and preferred), but lacked the true color and taste of the red paper paste that you get from fresh kimchi.,I also ordered the spinach and garlic pouch and the mushroom pouch to put on the grill. I could barely taste the garlic in the spinach and the mushrooms just tasted like boiled mushrooms. ,I'm not going to give this place a one-star rating because their veggies are subpar. I knew what I was getting into and enjoyed the selection they offer for non-meat eaters. Not sure how much the restaurant can change the menu because it is a chain, but better veggie sides and preparation would make this place more enjoyable."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/27/2018,$$,5,Doraku Sushi,I love Doraku!! I come here a lot and it's always delicious. The brussel sprouts and crispy bok choy are my favorite along with the veggie fried rice. Vegan friendly. Excellent happy hour specials. The service can sometimes be slow but they recently got a new manager named Edmundo who seems to be improving the service a lot. I highly recommend this place!
"2721 NW 79th Ave, Doral, FL 33122",4/22/2017,$,5,Central Park Food Station,This small and cozy place is amazing. You have variety from vegan dishes to traditional Venezuelan ones. I came here for lunch while working in Doral & always brought my co workers along. I will always return.
"7991 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",3/29/2018,$$,4,Tropical Chinese Restaurant,"Excellent food and excellent dim sum. A bit pricey, but you're getting great flavor and good service. Very attractive interior. Shrimp dumplings here are my favorite and were a go to of mine. Plum wine here is also delicious. Since going vegan their tofu dishes have been life savers; black bean tofu is where it's at!"
"7991 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",1/28/2018,$$,3,Tropical Chinese Restaurant,"Not the best dim sum place in Miami but not the worst either. If you're the kind of person that cares more about the look of a restaurant than actual food quality, this place is for you. The bright side: decor is pretty cute, and the prices are also reasonable. The service is also nice and extremely attentive. The downside: the food is mediocre, is under-seasoned and probably only tastes good when you've had one too many lychee martinis. All our food was bland and left me yearning for better dim sum I've had in the past. The dim sum menu is pretty small and lacks variety. Kon Chau which is only a few minutes away is extremely superior in both taste and authenticity. This is a dim sum spot you go to when you're on a date and the ambiance is more important than the food. There are a disappointing amount of vegetarian dim sum options, so vegans or meat-eaters on meatless Mondays should avoid this place."
"8347 NW 36th St, Doral, FL 33166",9/10/2017,$$,5,Marfil Bistro,"We came here for the first time, our waiter was very polite and accommodating. We are vegan, so I asked the waiter if I could order a vegetable pasta, he said he would check with the chef. When he returned he said the chef will make anything you want! He told me to choose whatever pasta, vegetables, and sauce I wanted. I was just very basic because I didn't want to be demanding, so I asked for linguine with mushrooms, tomatoes, and red tomato sauce. When I got my food the chef added zucchini, asparagus and other vegetables! Best vegetable pasta I have had, very flavorful! The chef was amazing, not only did he make something that was not on the menu, but during our meal, he came out to greet us and made sure everything was ok with what we ordered! Excellent customer service! I wasn't expecting them to do this for me, because I usually get turned down at restaurants and just end up ordering a salad. This is my first yelp review and I just want to say thank you very much! I live in Hawaii but come to Miami a few times a year, when I'm here this will be my go to place!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/28/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Woah woah woah! Everything was seriously delicious! We had the Pear Flatbread, the Mushroom Risotto, the soup of the day which was mushroom, and the Matcha Pudding! I have to say I don't know what I liked most. Everything was mouthwatering. My fiancé and I fought for the matcha pudding. Whoever gives this place a bad review is dead wrong, and if non vegans give this place a bad review they need to go to a non vegan restaurant. The cashew cheese was spectacular and we are really happy we found this spot. Full vegans are scarce in this city."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/16/2018,$$,3,GLAM Vegan,"My friend came to visit me and we decided to give this place a try. I ordered the risotto, which was extremely bland, and my friend got the burger. I give the burger a solid three stars because it was more flavorful than my risotto, but it was still nothing that would make you come back again. The beverage menu is extensive, however most of the drinks contain alcohol. If you don't drink or are underage, expect to only get water. I asked the cashier if they had Coke products or any soda and she gave me a funny look before telling me they did not.  This place is a little pretentious and  overpriced.  However, this was my first time eating at a vegan restaurant so perhaps I should have had different expectations coming here."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We are vegan and tried this restaurant for the first time. Vegan restaurants are more common now, but we can always use more! Great clean restaurant. Love the fact that you can get filtered water (sparkling, cold, and ambient temp) at no additional cost. Menu items all sound delicious and reasonable in price. We are used to Miami Beach prices, so these are 20-30% lower. We ordered 4 dishes to try a variety of items. Chilled Kelp Noodles, SO much taste in a small bowl and very fresh. Loved the colors of the dish also. Roasted Mushroom Flatbread. Wow, that was a great bust of flavors. Very succulent and adding the thyme to the dish made this the best dish we tried here today. Great presentation of the dish! Fava Bean Puree Toast, was served on Zak's multi-grain bread (pretty sure). Good dish with good taste and good look, but a little bit boring compared to the other dishes we tried. Spaghetti & Meatless Balls, we got this with pasta noodles, but gluten free and zucchini noodles also available. The tomato sauce was definitely homemade and it was excellent. The meatless balls were very good and overall the dish was really great (and messy, lol). Very satisfying dish that meat eaters would like also.,Overall, great place with excellent dishes that all seem to be made in the restaurant from scratch, which is very impressive. Everything was $44 with tax and tips and that was very reasonable. We will be back many times again. Thanks for saving the animals. Every little step counts!,EDIT 1/24/18. Tried the new BBQ burger. A bit too heavy and dense for our taste. Tastes mostly like rice and beet. The slaw that came with the burger was great though."

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/3/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Okay, so I knew this place had good reviews, but this isn't typical the food I go for when I go to eat at a vegan restaurant. However, this place did really surprise me and I was very satisfied. The flatbreads are so good and filling! Desserts are pretty tasty (Get the Matcha Pot de Creme and Choco-Avocado desserts!), the truffles remind me of Lara bars, and I didn't get to try the Ube pie. I really like the decor and atmosphere and the location of Midtown. I would suggest visiting here early and avoiding popular meal times since seating can be limited and some items may be unavailable. I would visit here again!"

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Miami Midtown first vegan restaurant is now open in heart of Midtown (4 Midtown Building).   The menu selection has a good variety.  The Jackfuit Taco was juicy.  I love flatbreads and the flavor of their Pear Flatbread was equal or better than one made with real cheese.  Awesome they serve beer and wine along with the traditional juices.   The deserts look and taste yummy.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We ordered about 10 different dishes and were not disappointed with a single one. Definitely try the watermelon poke, crazy good flavor!

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/6/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"A treasure to behold and a genuine oasis for Vegans of all stripes.  Such an orderly, creative, and well-run establishment that serves consistently exquisite vegan dishes.  Upon arrival, the clean aesthetic was well-received and the attention to detail/customer service was extraordinary.  We ordered and were directed towards a premium water filter machine that offers still and sparkling water (free of charge!).  After sitting down we didn't wait but 5 minutes before our first dish arrived - an avocado toast plate that was thoroughly prepared and instantaneously devoured.  Precisely at the moment when we were ready for round 2 - an amazingly abundant kale salad dish arrived with the perfect balance of dressing/oil and fresh, unscathed vegetation.  Thinking it couldn't get any better - we were then blessed with one of the most enjoyable flatbreads we've ever tasted.  The entire menu is vegan - and the GLAM stands for ""Green Living Animals Matter"" -- and indeed this establishment gets a Massive Salute for its recognition of Universal Rights properly applied to include animals in the pantheon of natural and cosmic law.  This one was one of the most memorable vegan experiences we've ever had - and we can only hope that GLAM serves as a blueprint for vegan eateries to replicate moving forward.  Zero infractions were issued and the temptation to genuflect upon exiting the restaurant was decisively strong, but alas, was resisted. ,Vegan Level: 1,000,000,Breatharian Ascension Potentiality:  Imminent"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Thankfully, the word ""vegan"" is slowly not being viewed as a curse word in American society. Places like this help people understand that healthy, plant-based food can taste great! Vegan or not, you need to try this restaurant."

"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/20/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My first Vegan experience and I'm in HEAVEN!!! I was always skeptical about Vegan food, I assumed bland, veggies and salad... but now way all was so savory, delish plates! I was so wronggggg!!! I am coming back for sure. The atmosphere has such a great vibe, very modern, amazing employees, great service."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,I am not vegan and I had a great experience! I had the Chana masala and the matcha passion fruit dessert. They tasted delicious and I felt definitely satisfied afterwards.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/19/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Great place and loved the service. We ordered the chana masala and the risotto, both were very good! I feel this would be a great place to take your non vegan friends as they will probably be satisfied with anything they order.,The atmosphere was good and we didnt have to wait too much (although we went for lunch on a Saturday).,The date balls were pretty good too! Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/29/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Everyone has that one vegan friend who swears they've found a restaurant with food meat eaters will truly enjoy, that is falvorful and filling, and that won't break your budget. Normally, I inwardly groan and begrudgingly agree to tag along -- but expect to pay premium price to go home hungry. Not so with Glam! I was blown away by this counter-style restaruant's delightful menu: Chana masala, flatbreads with ""ricotta"" cheese, miso avocado toast, spaghetti and ""meatballs,"" and many other mouthwatering options for both veggie and meat lovers alike. Kid you not, we tried almost everything on the menu because none of us could decide what we wanted, and absolutely every dish was bursting with flavor. Portions are massive and well priced for such a delicious and wholesome meal. The only reason I'm not giving Glam five stars is an entirely personal preference: I wish ther were servers. With food this good, I think the traditional service atmosphere would add a little something extra."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/4/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I want to start by saying I am not a vegan but I do enjoy vegan and vegetarian meals every so often. The employees are nice but way too slow. The sangria was pretty horrible,it reminded me of Minute Maid fruit punch juice  (pass me a cup of water please). ,My favs:,Ube pie (Who needs sweet potato pie) ,Roasted Mushroom flat bread (Bye bye mushroom pizza),Sausage pepper flat bread (Who needs veggie pizza?),Watermelon poke (Who needs tuna?),My number 1 item is the Al pastor taco (to die for!)they create a shredded beef texture by using jackfruit. It's a little spicy and pricey because it's 7$ per taco. But it's a must! ,My least favorite was the (""Lean Green"") pesto zucchini because it's cold and doesn't have enough of a pesto flavor.  The meatless meatball spaghetti was also my least favorite because the after test reminded me of the purple jelly bean and that no one wants to eat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/1/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,First time visiting GLAM and it was great! My boyfriend and I are new to vegan restaurants and were pleasantly surprised. The spaghetti and meatless balls was delicious and so was the mushroom flatbread. Will be visiting again!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Great vegan resturant for non-vegans. Very budget friendly. Try the Rissoto it is very creamy and good. The atmosphere is chill. Great music playing and never was crowed the times I have gone there. Also the truffles are to die for. Also I meet the owner she is very friendly and will help you.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,This is one of the best vegan places I've visited ... is kind of self serve service super casual and the food is simply delicious !!! My fav are the jackfruit taco  and the spaghetti and meatballs (all vegan )
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Went here for lunch the other day with my friend. We got the avocado toast which was delicious! I have to give light to their pear flatbread though. This is one the best dishes i have ever had in my life! I am now craving it every meal!! Great atmosphere and food comes quickly. Great experience and even better food. I'm not even vegan, but this place is amazing!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/31/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This Vegan restaurant is amazing! The spaghetti and meatless balls was sooo yummy, vegan cheese platter delicious (as a cheese lover it was a great substitute) and the tres leches had me wondering how in the world it was dairy free! Sooooo good! You must check it out!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/11/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I cannot stress how much i love this place! I eat here every week. The menu is phenomenal. I am a huge fan of the cauliflower risotto, the falafel meat ball and spaghetti, and all the flat breads. You feel good after eating here. Literally I want to go full on vegan because of this restaurant!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Holy moly guacamole!!!!!!! This. Place. Is. AWESOME-SAUCE!!!!!! Vegan or no vegan, GO HERE AND EAT YOUR HEART OUT!!!!! Most delish vegan restaurant I have been at. This is a must visit when visiting Miami!!!!!!!!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/27/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Went there Monday for lunch and I gotta say the food is spectacular. We ordered the ""sausage"" flatbread and the risotto and they were both delicious. (Especially the risotto.) It's sort of a self-serve spot when it comes to the water and cutlery which is weird because it doesn't really go with the vibe. The decor, cutlery and vibe seems expensive and up-scale but it's sort of a fast-dining kinda thing. We spoke to one of the servers /bussers that day. A young man. We talked about vegan diet and how to make the transition right - he was nice and knowledgeable and it's cool to have staff who knows about vegan food and is vegan themselves. Makes the whole thing stay true to the concept. Will be returning here for food. It's a cool spot and the only vegan one midtown."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/12/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Very nice selection of vegan dishes. Food was flavorful - watermelon ceviche awesome as well as poke dish.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/27/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I don't usually like vegan stuff, but the food was great. People serving, nice and warm. Cool place. Only thing I didn't like is the system the created for getting your food. I'd much rather the old fashion waiter or take your food yourself...On this place you buy at the counter and they bring your food. But not the forks and knives...it's alright tough."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/17/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food here was much better than expected. Flavorful. This is an excellent spot to show your Omnivore friends that vegan cuisine is not just sticks and twigs. The average meal price is about 10-15$ person. Not too expensive and reasonable for the location. Staff is super friendly and presentable. They make you feel at home even when you're a vegan noob that knows nothing yet. No spots on the silverware or glasses, either so you know you're eatin' fancy-like.,If I'm ever in Miami again, will certainly visit."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/23/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My boyfriend and I had been meaning to try this vegan spot for quite some time. We are so happy that we passed by. All the food was very flavorful and satisfying. We will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. My favorites were the mushroom bisque, spaghetti and ""meat balls"", and the purple sweet potato pie. My only complaint was the lady at the front register was not very welcoming. I went to get a menu and she put her hand over it not letting me get a menu to see for myself. Our waiter however, was super friendly so that made up for it. Overall, I definitely recommend if you are looking for something vegan and delicious."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We've been waiting for this place to open and came in on opening day. Everything is amazing! We had several dishes and they were all delicious. We are not vegan, we just like food food and we enjoyed everything. Some highlights were the jack fruit taco, the ginger carrot soup and the flat bread. The desserts were awesome as well, the matcha pot de creme was to die for!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is my favorite vegan restaurant by far. The customer service is great and the environment is hip. I love their daily soups, plates and desserts. You can eat a lot here without feeling bloated. They do not over seasoned the meals, and they keep a very clean area. If you are looking for a great flat lay food option, then this is your place. The vibe is great to even study there and grab a few snacks. It is great for big groups and they have an outside seating area. I am a returning customer."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Finally Miami have a bit of Vegan food to offer. GLAM was diffidently a refreshing surprise!! The food is fresh, elegant and the prices are really affordable. My wife and I started with the gazpacho soup- that had a great flavor, nothing special there but tasty, then we took the kelp noodles that were with a great texture and flavors. For mains we took the Masala chickpeas and the Farro mushrooms risotto. The risotto was Amazing!! A dish to come back for, the Masala was good but Indian restaurants make it better.,All in all I am very happy with this place, I'll be back for sure. Hope more Vegan places like that will pop up in Miami ."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/24/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Great to have a new vegan restaurant in the area.  I certainly love the Jack Fruit Tacos.   Very nice to sit on the sidewalk out front.  Only negative was that I felt they could use a bit more expansive menu.  Many of the items are things I make at home.  But none the less, yummy."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/11/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Carnivores listen up -- there's a new vegan spot in Midtown that will even turn the most meat loving diners into converts. Well, at least for their meal. Called GLAM -- short for green living animals matter -- it's a vegan spot featuring world inspired cuisine by chef Todd Erickson of Huahua's and Haven fame and we got a first look.,The fast-casual menu is divided into multiple sections depending on your mood and hunger. Smaller snacks include dishes like a Watermelon Poke tossed in konbu, lotus, sesame, sweet tamari, nori and a yuzu vinaigrette or the chilled Kelp Noodles made with ginger, almond, coconut, siracha, scallion, daikon and basil. Other unique items like the Jackfruit ""Al Pastor"" Tacos and Cashew Cheese Platter can also be found, and the fact that they don't have any animal product in them will almost come as a surprise.,Larger options include a variety of flatbreads, with our favorite being the Sausage and Pepper that is topped with a grain-based Italian ""sausage"", charred peppers, marinara, arugula and basil. Of course, you'd be remiss to not try one of GLAM's toast offerings with the classic Avocado Toast topped with orange and tajin being as beautiful as it was delicious. For those looking for a hearty dish, the chickpea-based Chana Masala with garam masala, mango, tomato chutney, papadum, and quinoa will satisfy any hunger pang.,Make sure not to overlook dessert, because even though they are missing dairy they are still tasty and cravable. Our favorites were the Matcha Tea Pots de Crème with mango, passdonfuit and coconut and the avocado based Choco-Cado Mousse made with dark chocolate, avocado, agave and coconut. Wash the whole meal back with a Sake-Rose Sangria filled with pear, pineapple and berry for a refreshing treat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/11/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I had the BBQ Burger with the coleslaw. The burger was outstanding and this was the first coleslaw I have ever liked. The service was great as well fast and friendly. I loved the decor of the restaurant very simple but modern. The food is a little pricey, but what vegan restaurant isn't. If I'm ever in the area I will definitely return. Beefless meatballs next"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/30/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is the bombbb! One of my favorite vegan spots. Amazing quality and big portions (bowls and flatbreads). Honestly everything on the menu is amazing & if you think otherwise let them know after first bite and they are more than please to accommodate. They have recently added menu options which make me very happy and have also upped the price a bit, but for what they serve it is still worth every penny. You can really taste all the love put into these recipes. ,This is they're BBQ burger *spicy*"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I got the spaghetti and meatless balls with zucchini noodles and ended the meal with the matcha custard. It was very tasty to my surprise and I left feeling great. I would definitely recommend Glam Vegan to anyone looking for tasty, healthy options!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/13/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious, affordable vegan food. Granted, Miami has lots of these options (maybe not as much on the affordable side), but GLAM is one of the better ones. The name pretty much warrants an eye-roll (sometimes acronyms just aren't meant to be and seem way too forced), but get past that and you've got delicious food at decent prices. ,Everyone there is friendly and even checked up on us after we had started eating (how many fast casual places do that??). The food was flavored great and wasn't too over the top like some vegan places are when trying to appeal to the omnivores of the human race. ,Give this place a try!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/26/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious vegan food! Must try! The vegan risoto and pizza are super yummy. only thing? I wish the music they play at the restaurant goes with the ""vibe"". Organic, green living,vegan animal matter style ;) the selection playing was very miami (not in a good way)! it's just a little ""but"". it's perfection!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Nice casual place to enjoy vegans meals. Very simple menu and the ambiance is trendy. My girlfriend and I shared the spaghetti and grain ball dish. Pasta was good not too salty but the meatless meatball has a bitterness after bite to it. Kelp noodles has a nice crunch to it with awesome flavors. But our favorite one was the lean and green salad. The zucchini noodles along with a mixture of lemon oregano, broccoli, and avocado was amazing. Definitely recommend it!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Wow, amazing vegan place! I had the risotto and my wife had the channa masalla and both dishes were amazing. The service was very quick and the atmosphere is casual and pleasant. This place also had a very nice filtered water station! ,We will definitely be coming back here."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I'm not a vegan, but I DO care about what I eat and having options like GLAM that offer delicious & stylish plate presentations from appetizers thru desserts makes staying ""on-track"" a pleasure not a chore. ,The free sparkling water on tap is also a great surprise!,Here's hoping they franchise. The country could use it"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/23/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"What?! You're vegan (or vegan curious) and haven't tried Glam Vegan? Well you haven't lived. Run, don't walk, and fill your tummy with delicious roasted mushroom flatbread, spaghetti and ""meatballs"", French toast, truffles, chocolate mousse, And their amazing Ubi pie. You can thank me later. :)"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/30/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Outstanding food, neat atmosphere, friendly staff. Every dish I've tried there has been delicious. I wish I could give GLAM more than 5 stars. This restaurant is easily the best vegan restaurant I've tried in Miami. Don't worry meat eaters, you'll love it too.,I highly recommend the cashew cheese platter for an appetizer, any of the flatbreads (my favorites are the pear flatbread and the mushroom one) or mushroom risotto as an entree, and the matcha tea custard or truffles for dessert. ,Bravo, GLAM. Consider me your newest regular."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"GLAM Vegan is my favorite Vegan place in Miami....it's not too expensive, it's a quick service where they bring the food to you, everyone who works there is super nice!  They use actual dishes and silverware so it's low waste too!  Every single thing that I or my friends have gotten has been super delicious.  It is so nice going somewhere where I don't have to worry about what is in the food or creating a ton of waste with my meal.  Plus they have a water machine that serves up flat or sparkling water for free!  Love the ambiance and love Glam Vegan"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/9/2018,$$,3,GLAM Vegan,"Clean and all that but I can't stand when vegan restaurants sell you basically ""compressed brown rice"" as a meat substitute and charge you $15 for it. I had the BBQ burger and it was drenched in super sweet sauce. The patty was compressed brown rice and beet ""blood"". My son has spaghetti and compressed brown rice meatballs. MEH."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/19/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Overall I never go vegan, but this is AHMAZING!!! We will be back for sure!!!,Great service great food a win win ,Thank you for being awesome and opening up a closed mind!!"

We go there regularly, and I always bring my little dog with me, and they are all kind to us especially the lady who takes the orders, she is adorable! I'm so glad they opened this restaurant! Their BBQ Burger is outstanding, and the variety of fresh things they have is fantastic. Wine, beers, and kombucha are served as well. Five stars review no doubt! Thanks, Glam!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/14/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,Found this place on Yelp today and I was happily impressed! My husband is Vegan and we love finding new vegan spots to eat. I had the Mushroom  Risotto w/ Cashew Cream and White Wine it was amazing. They serve generous portions that will fill you up. Great Job and please keep adding to the menu.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/18/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,This has just become one of my favorite vegan spots. I took my partner here for her bday and it super exceeded my expectations. The meatless balls were AMAZING. My partner got the mushroom risotto and that was also amazing. For dessert we tried the Tres leches and it was so amazing we ordered a second one! The staff was super friendly and nice. We are already planning our next visit!  highly recommend this place!
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/28/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Great vegan food - we had spaghetti, gazpacho and matcha passion fruit dessert and we loved everything."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/16/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"GLAM - another vegan restaurant that doesn't taste like i.  This place does a great job of being quick, affordable, and delicious.  Combined that Big 3 with being healthy and feeling great leaving, this place is a regular go-to, especially at lunch.  Sit outside with a laptop and shades and get the burger.  The vegan barbecue really is tasty, and this is coming from someone from Memphis, TN.  If you're in the midtown area, I highly recommend."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/13/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Such a cute concept! I love this place. I tried a TON of food and still only spent $30. Everything was amazing and worth every single dollar spent. For non-vegans, the flavors alone will keep you coming back. A lovely restaurant with attentive and kind staff."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"What I love about this place is that they do not use single use plastic, they are super green and promote community unity. Great spot for lunch, and honestly, you can't even tell the food is vegan. It's amazing, filling, and tasty!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/6/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is one of the best Vegan spots in town. ,Food: We had the Lean & Green zucchini noodle salad, chana masala and a date ball for desert - all were fresh and delicious, and prices were very reasonable for the quality. ,Service: Very friendly. You walk up and order from a counter, but they do have servers who bring your food and bussers to clear tables. ,Atmosphere: Cozy inside, but we sat outdoors at one of the tables since we had our dog. ,Parking: Pretty easy since it's midtown and there is street parking as well as garage parking available. ,We will definitely be back!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"So glad GLAM has opened in Midtown! We need more vegan restaurants like this in Miami. I went with a couple friends, many of which aren't vegetarian or vegan, and everyone loved it.,It's a small venue with a trendy modern ambience. The staff is very friendly and helpful with providing suggestions of their best dishes. The portions are surprisingly well sized, compared to other trendy vegan places. ,The farro risotto was so delicious - it's so creamy, you'll be surprised there's no dairy in it. Also a hit is the pesto zucchini noodles dish. The pesto is clearly house-made - sooo fresh. Definitely treat yourself to a vegan truffle after your meal. The cacao and almond one is basically like a healthy brownie bite. ,The restaurant is a little bit on the pricey side, but I understand that food with specialty ingredients like this costs more than your average restaurant. Will be returning to try more off their menu!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/16/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Pros: If you are looking for light, healthy, delicious vegan options, this is the place for you! I was really craving a fresh dish and GLAM vegan hit the spot. I ordered the white bean soup and the Lean and Green bowl, both surpassed expectation. I plan on trying everything on the menu. All selections were mouth watering, any veggie lover would agree. Definitely RD approved!,Cons: The to-go utensils were made of woody material, at first sight I thought: Wow, chic! Hooray, more sustainable than plastic! However, I was sorely mistaken, it was difficult eating with the super cute utensils, the spoon was too shallow for soup, the fork was awkward. Obviously nitpicking here! Try this place out!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/20/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"As someone who became vegan just 4 months ago, coming to GLAM Vegan was a real treat. My boyfriend and I chose this spot after spending a Saturday afternoon at the Frost museum. It was close by, casual, and we don't have many vegan options in Kendall, where we live. ,Parking was was easy. We paralleled parked at a meter relatively close by. The area is cute enough that I didn't mind the short trek to GLAM. ,The restaurant is more of the bistro type. You order first at the register, then they assign you a number. You also pick up your cutlery, linen napkins, and your choice of sparkling water or water in a glass. Finding a table was easy which I was happy about. It's considerably small. We decided we'd sit outdoors because all the tables were packed and the weather was beautiful anyway. ,We ordered the cashew cheese plate to start, along with my order of mushroom risotto and my boyfriends pepper flatbread. To finish we chose the ube pie. We took home an order of the buffalo cauliflower. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the cheese plate, mushroom risotto, and the buffalo cauliflower. ,The service was great as well. Very friendly staff that make you feel at ease walking in. They're attentive and it makes just that more appealing. ,Although it's a bit far, I'd definitely come back and recommend it to all my vegan and non vegan friends alike."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/18/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My favorite vegan restaurant in the city, for sure! I just went once, but I have never tried any healthy vegan food with so much taste and textures! I am pretty sure I am coming back soon. ,Although the location and the decoration compensate the prices, it could be a little bit less, and so more people would go more often, just like me.,I had the zucchini spaghetti with meat balls; even though I am not a fan of tomato sauce, it was the best ever! My boyfriend had the favo risotto and it was pretty good too! I wish I could had the truffle and the pie, but maybe next time... I was really satisfied with everything."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/23/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Pretty delicious food coming out of this vegan restaurant. With indoor and outdoor seating available, you order your food at the front, receive a numbered block for your table and take a seat, food is brought out for you. There is a decent selection to choose from for Starters, main entrees, smoothies and desserts- menu can be found online. For a Starter, I ordered the Jack Fruit Taco Al Pastor ($7), it's a single soft tortilla with a generous portion of the bbq jackfruit, I had to eat a bit of it with a fork to be able to fold and eat it like a taco which is perfectly fine! Without the tortilla and toppings it is pretty acidic tasting, but once you eat everything with the salsa, and crema together it's very well balanced and delicious! I ordered the Farro Risotto ($15), was a generous portion of risotto, with plenty of mushrooms, the dish was pretty heavy, but I enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. For dessert, we had the Choco-cado Mousse (chocolate-avocado mousse topped with fresh berries and shredded coconut), and a Matcha Tea Custard (matcha custard topped with chopped mango, and passion fruit- with seeds). The Matcha custard was nice and creamy, and didn't have a heavy matcha taste- which I like. The custard to fruit ratio was a little off, I wish there was a tad more fruit to get enough fruit in each bite. I would recommend this place"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/9/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Totally a fan of Glam. The decor alone had me at hello! I loved the concept of vegan being glamorous which put a twist on it not seeming so boring. My family and I almost ordered everything on the menu. We ordered the following:,---Watermelon Poke- what a great take on Tuna Poke. Was very refreshing and light,--Black bean soup- ,--Pear flatbread- was so good. The cashew ricotta was really good. Totally didn't miss the cheese,--Sausage & pepper flatbread- All I have to say is that it really tasted like sausage and I don't eat the real thing. ,--Avocado Miso Toast-I didn't try this but my brother said it was really good,--Spaghetti and  Meatless balls- The noodles was really good along with the sauce. My daughter like this dish even though she complained about eating it. The meatless ball was was ok I thought.,--Chana Masala-this dish is a bit spicy and has a good Indian flavor of curry in it. The quinoa was tasteless.,--Lean & Green- was flavorful with the lemon-basil pesto. It threw me off that it was cold noodles. I didn't pay attention to the menu.,--Farro Risotto-- wow this tasted just like mac & cheese. Loved this dish,We literally had a feast and tried a bit of everything. I liked Glam but I'm not sure if it would be my go-to vegan restaurant. It was great to try but maybe not to have often. Definitely a great place to bring first timers to try vegan food."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/3/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Went outside my usual food zone to try GLAM Vegan on Saturday evening. I ordered the Gazpacho and Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" as appetizers, the Farro Risotto as my entree, and an Almond Coconut Truffle for dessert.,Quality,Nothing about my visit to GLAM Vegan changed my attitude towards being an omnivore. However, I was impressed with the creativity that comes with making different food choice selections. With an open-mind I ordered several different items from the menu with varying levels of comfort. I started with the Gazpacho, which was a solid bowl of soup. With chunks of tomato and cucumber, the tomato based soup with cilantro, sherry vinegar, and breadcrumbs was a good start. Next came the Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" and I must admit I was worried about seeing quotation marks around food items on the menu. The dish was sliced jackfruit in bbq sauce served with pineapple, red cabbage, tomatillo salsa, and tofu cream. It was a unique and tasty combination of flavors that mixed spicy and sweet. Even though it was clearly not shredded pork, the jackfruit provided a good substitute that did not make me miss the meat. The Farro Risotto was not a big stretch from the norm, a mushroom ragout, fennel, white wine, and cashew cream. The farro was cooked perfectly, the mushrooms were very flavorful, and the sauce was excellent. Now I was hoping for a piece of the Ube Pie, but apparently I was too late, so I settled for a Almond Coconut Truffle. It was the only flaw in an otherwise delicious meal. I am not a baker so I don't know what sort of substitutions are needed, but it came out very bland and had a grainy texture.,Quantity,Even though it was just an appetizer the Jackfruit Taco ""Al Pastor"" was still pretty substantial. The Farro Risotto meanwhile was massive and left me stuffed. ,Value,The menu was a bit expensive, but not as bad as I had expected. With so many people around me choosing vegan and vegetarian lifestyles I am used to seeing their bills be nearly double what I order at restaurants. But considering the amount of food and the quality I was okay paying the slightly higher price.,Ambiance,GLAM Vegan is located in Midtown Miami in a row of stores near the newly built apartment complexes. It is set up in a fast casual style that I am not the biggest fan of. After ordering at the inside counter you get a block and wait for the food to come to you. Inside they had about ten small tables and then a dozen or so outside. The restaurant was packed so outside was the only option for me. I grabbed a seat and almost instantly I started getting devoured by bugs and mosquitos. They did have soul music playing over the speakers outside to help the wait go by faster. Inside the store is very modern and sleek. Stylish design with color coordination and a focus on sustainability, as could be expected. The inside area also was very loud and the seats are tightly arranged.,Crowd,On Saturday evening the restaurant was completely packed. People gathered around outside waiting for people to leave their tables so they could scoop in. While it was clear that the restaurant had reached the vegan community, the delicious food also managed to catch the attention of others. I will say the crowd definitely swung towards the younger end and the outside area was a major attraction because many people had brought their dogs with them.,Service,The staff was absolutely great. The girl behind the counter was helpful and the waiters passing around the food were friendly and efficient. They managed to make jokes and stay positive as they darted back and forth from the kitchen.,Parking,I chose to park in one of the garages in Midtown to avoid the hassle of street parking. They also have valets set up nearby.,Extra,With so many vegetarian and vegan focused restaurants popping up across Miami, I decided to finally check one out. GLAM Vegan turned out to be a great choice as the unique and creative take on food has me really intrigued. While I approach it more as a type of food decision rather than a lifestyle or nutritional choice, I appreciate the time and effort it takes to develop these culinary creations."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Wow! Can I say this place lived up to it's reviews completely!!! I went here for my birthday with a group of 10 people. Half are vegan and the other are not but we're completely willing to try it. We literally made our dishes into tapas trying each other's food and everything was extremely tasty. From the spicy buffalo cauliflower to the watermelon ceviche to the vegan burger my party was totally blown away and had an open mind to try more. We kept on ordering more food because the non vegans loved it so we also tried the risotto mushroom and the spaghetti and meatballs. So good. Props to the owner and the staff. Very welcoming and accommodating! I would definitely come again.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/22/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is incredible! My girlfriend and I shared some Tacos, Spaghetti & Meatballs, and the BBQ Burger! Washed it down with some Pomegranate Kombucha, and finished the meal with some Teuffles. Everything was Vegan, Gluten Free, & DELICIOUS!!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/24/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I went here with my girlfriend for a random lunch date because we've heard nothing but good things about this vegan spot. It didn't disappoint. For a while we've been wanting to check this restaurant out. Appearance was great, the server was very attentive, and food was so good. Just the right amount served to satisfy us without getting too full. We had roasted mushroom flatbread to share, a lean a green cold noodle dish, and i had a bit of my girlfriend's gazpacho. After that, it was time for dessert! Out of the 2 desserts ordered, my favorite was the matcha tea custard. The other dish we ordered was the ube pie, made from sweet potato. It was delicious as well. Next time i want to try the truffles! ,There's so many options for food here i can't wait to try them all"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Another great spot to get your plant based meals! Vegan spots are starting to pop up all over and Glam is a small intimate quick service restaurant that does it very well! The presentations are beautiful and all served on elegant black plates. We had the avocado toast, the risotto, and the ""sausage"" flatbread!  All were excellent! My favorite was the flatbread and the cauliflower imitated the taste of sausage very well! ,The service is great and the entire staff was super friendly and welcoming. They have golden utensils that really pop against the black plates. Great for those instagram pics! ;) They also have a bunch of truffles right at the register that are ginormous and tempting! Smart tactic!  But this time for dessert, we had the matcha pots de creme! Soooo good! If you like creamy matcha, this is a must!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/11/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I could eat here almost everyday if I lived in the area. Vegan food thats yummy and the portions are great. I ordered 2 flat breads. 1 was the pear and the other was ""sausage"". My friend and I split them and they were simply delicious. The decor was casual with a drop of elegance on both the inside and out. I also got the mango apricot tea which comes unsweetened but they will provide you with a side of agave syrup. I was so impressed honestly. I had no idea that I would enjoy eating Vegan food so much but I've been looking for a reason to come into Midtown for lunch for months now and what better time to do it than now. I think next I want to try the spaghetti. At some point I'm planning on making my way through the entire menu. If you want some modern Vegan food that's flavored to perfection please check them out!!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/20/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"I'm not on the all vegan wagon yet but I do occasionally enjoy a plant-based meal. Vegan restaurants are starting to pop up all over Miami but not all are that good, this one here is one of the very few good ones. Came by today and had the daily soup to start and that is the Tuscan white bean and kale soup which was very delicious. The soup has depth and a creamy consistency that I enjoyed very much and the kale goes perfect with it. ,     Then I went for the spaghetti and meatless balls and that was also very good, to my surprise. The grain bean balls are crunchy on the outside and very flavorful, enough to forget that you are not actually eating meatballs, especially for those in the transition to becoming all vegan, not moi. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the marinara sauce was amazing enough to have without any Parmesan cheese which is a must for me when eating pasta.,     The place looks super clean and organized and they have a station with utensils, glasses, napkins and water...self serve. The service is good considering they only bring food out from the kitchen and pick up anything on the table. I'd love to try the Gaspacho next time because from the photos I've seen, it looks delicious."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/30/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The best VEGAN restaurant in Miami. The food at this place is AMAZING. Also they offer you free water and sparkling water. Prices are very good in compare to other overpriced fancy vegan restaurants. ,If you are a true vegan you will love this place and if you are not a vegan but like to eat clean you will be very surprise by this place. A+"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"My best friend and I came here for her birthday and must day I was pleasantly impressed. The place is cute and like the name said ""glam"". Loved the decor but I loved the food even more. Every dish that we had was amazing. The price point was great. I would recommend this to all the vegan divas and divos with excellent taste in food."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Recently been trying to transition from a Vegetarian to Vegan phase, my friends recommended this place and I loved the modern look and feel. Personally sitting outside is better on a nice night. Food was great and different. ,Recommend the BBQ burger."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/15/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Living in Broward has its disadvantages...it doesn't have GLAM!  My friend surprised me with a girls day out for lunch.  She is not Vegan, but she is so supportive and doesn't want me stuck eating a salad and french fries for lunch...so she brought me to Green Living Animals Matter (GLAM).,We walked in and the girl behind the counter was super nice.  She let us know immediately they had some kitchen issues so we were unable to get the jack-fruit tacos or the bisque.  No worries, there was plenty to eat.,Food:  My friend and I shared everything.  We started with the Mushroom Risotto.  YOU MUST have this!  It was amazing.  We also had the pear flatbread.  It was probably my favorite of everything we ate.  It had pears, cashew ""ricotta,"" and red onions with a pesto sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  The Miso Avocado Toast was tasty, but hey everyone can make an avocado toast.  We also had the white bean hummus..not my favorite.  The tahini seemed over powering.  The hummus came with a homemade cracker made from sesame seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds and pumpkin seeds.  AWESOME!  We also had some lattes made with toasted coconut almond milk.  DELISH!,The restaurant is pretty much self service.  You order at the register, get a number and the team brings it to you.  They also have self service water.  You can get sparkling water, flat water or effervescent water.  The silverware is gold and there are no paper napkins.  The seating inside is limited, but they have outside seating as well.  ,Everyone, including the other patrons, were super friendly.  Customers were willing to make suggestions on what to eat.  ,It was nice to go out for a vegan meal that wasn't filled with tofu and salad.  The food was innovative and delicious.  I wish they were closer to my home, as I'd be there daily!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,Found Glam on yelp while looking for vegan restaurants while staying in Wynwood. We enjoyed the mushroom risotto & nachos. I definitely recommend this place.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"Was in the mood for some vegan food so I stopped by for lunch. ,I ordered the jackfruit taco ""al pastor"" with bbq jackfruit, pineapple, red cabbage,tomatillo salsa, tofu cream and the Lean and green bowl - zucchini noodles, chunky avocado, snow peas, asparagus, broccolini, lemon-basil pesto. ,The jack fruit tacos were extremely delicious and definitely my favorite. Was really impressed how the jackfruit had so much flavor and texture and consistency was like a shredded beef. It has a nice spicy kick to it. Wow! However they are quite pricey. At $7 a piece I could have had 4-5. Do the math $28 for 4 tacos it can get quite pricey. Ouch! ,The zoodle bowl was good, honestly nothing special. I Was expecting the pesto sauce to have that strong savory herbal flavor, it didn't. ,Overall very nice spot, can't wait to try the other dishes."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/12/2017,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"I love the concept of GLAM vegan. I've heard so many great things about it that I finally decided to give it a try for myself. The restaurant is very chic, the staff are friendly, and the food is good. ,At the register, they offer samples of their soup of the day. While, I can't remember exactly what sample I had, I wasn't very impressed. The soup was very thick but that was from the excessive amount of flour used to create the consistency. Overall, it lacked flavor and was very bland. Although, I ordered the Mushroom Risotto which was surprisingly pleasant. The risotto was very creamy, flavorful, and filling! ,There are some other items on the menu that I would love to try, so I'll definitely be coming back."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/2/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Loved it here! The mushroom bisque was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed the Hawaiian poke bowl. It was surprisingly close to real poke! Our server was super good looking (please take my number if you're reading this) and very helpful, answered a lot of my companion's questions. They also put the ricotta on the side of his spaghetti upon request which was very nice and considerate. My companion is not vegan and I am, so he wasn't a big fan of the seitan meatballs but I'd run that up to personal taste and not preparation, I thought it was amazing! I loved the vibe there, it was very Miami while still being a bit romantic and classic. I'm hoping to return before leaving the city, absolutely loved it!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/6/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"OMG.. If there were 50 Stars, GLAM Vegan would get all of them!!  3 times over!! ,This little place is so magically delicious!  So much so, I went twice during the same weekend I was down to visit. ,There is a delicious menu with appetizers, main meals and desserts as well as wine!  It doesn't get any better than that.  They even have a cool water machine where you can pick your own water type and fill up a bottle to take to your table.  Still, sparkling, cold or ambient water.. SO COOL!,You walk in and you place your order at the main counter.  You then get an oversized what looks like a Scrabble tile with a number on it to place on your table so they know where to bring your goodies!  ,As I enjoy my dessert first (why wouldn't you - what if something happened to you before your actual meal came?!  Wouldn't you have liked to have began with the sweetest thing??) and it was a Tres Leches yumminess that I wish was bigger! The cake was soft and moist and was topped off with a dollop of this whipped cream that you couldn't tell me was not dairy!  Nom Nom Nommy Nom Nom!  ,Then it was on to the spaghetti and ""meat"" balls.  SO. GOOD!!! Again.. you couldn't tell me they didn't sneak beef up in them meatballs.  The noodles were cooked to al dente perfection and the sauce was seasoned by angels.  So delicious!!,The service was spectacular.  Everyone was kind and sweet and GLAM is now one of my Miami must go to eat places whenever I'm down there.  Whether you are vegan or not.. treat yourself and everyone with you to some yummy good food that is also good FOR you too!!  Thank you, GLAM, for BEING!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/28/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Glam vegan is definitely a must try vegan spot, it's hard to choose a fave but their ceviche was out standing"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2017,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Glam Vegan definitely lives up to its name. I kind of feel like the vegan food genre gets a horrible rep for itself in that the food has to be boring, the places are decorated blah and nothing is never ever really good. This is totally not the case here!,Located in Midtown, it's got a cute little vibe to it. Has very modern and sophisticated decor, I really loved the gold silverware. Was definitely a nice touch. Water is self serve and the process is simple, you go to the counter, order, they give you a number and bam! You have your food a little later.,My first dish was the watermelon poke which was a great play on tuna poke. Totally admitting, it didn't taste like tuna, the textures of the watermelon gave it a nice bite. I love the lotus and yuzu vinaigrette too. Nice mix of sweet, a little tart.,My meal was the farm salad bowl which I was really nervous about since it was my meal. It was huge, delicious and so much better than I could ever imagine? Who knew cashew ranch could be so delicious!? I could have done without the green beans, but thank god there was avocado! Everything was fresh and delicious, I honestly couldn't ask for more.,Meal came to $21 which overall I don't consider bad for being in Miami and being a speciality type of restaurant. I highly recommend Glam if you're looking for something different, something healthy, and just plain good (for you)."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/21/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This place is a Gem. The nachos were great. Also, had the buffalo cauliflower bowl. My parents who aren't vegan were pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend this place!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/3/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"This was actually our first visit to Glam, but now it definitely became our favorite place in town. As vegans, it is always hard to find a place where we can find veganlicious food, with kid friendly options. The place was clean, charmingly decorated, neat, and very relaxing. The staff was very receptive and kind. My husband had a BBQ Burger, the kids had Nachos to share, and I had a Chana Masala Hot Bowl. Don't forget to have dessert, they all look delicious, we went with the Ube Pie...and O.M.G, I can not describe how delightful it was!,So, I absolutely recommend this place!,Can't wait to come back! ,@harmannylife"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/21/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"We have been into our fair share of vegan restaurants in the Washington DC area but this is the best that we have been to untill now. ,Located in midtown miami district,  this place has a cool interior decor (limited indoor seating area). We order their daily soup- gazpacho which was cold but did not lack in flavor  - something that can be said about every dish we had! We tried the mushroom bisque,  mushroom flatbread and farro Risotto topped with shrooms (guess what we are into these days!) ,They have Vero water dispenser which has sparkling water as well. Something new that we haven't seen anywhere else.,Overall, this place is pretty unique, entirely vegan and everyone should definitely try it once when in Miami. We are definitely coming back to Glam Vegan the next tine we are in town!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/2/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,"For those who want to explore vegan cuisine, this place is just for you! Located in the up and coming Miami Midtown area, this restaurant serves creative vegan food that truly is delicious, regardless if it was vegan or not. This restaurant is an order and then sit down type of restaurant, which makes it pretty causal and straight forward. Parking availability includes street parking and garage parking, although the latter is more convenient.,Now on to the food: if you think vegan food could not be tasty, this place will prove you wrong! My party ordered a variety of things, my favorites being the Hawaiian poke salad and the pear flatbread! So many great flavors, all of which were very good at substituting what you would think would normally contain meat, like the Jackfruit Tacos and the BBQ burger (which had too much BBQ sauce in my opinion, but of course that is just preference). I also like that there was somewhat a South East Asian flair in their dishes, many of which used ingredients from that area of the world. For dessert, my BF and I took some Ube pie home, as we love Ube (a purple yam that is a staple in Filipino dishes)! However, it did not have the Ube flavor we were looking for, and tasted like the typical sweet potato pie you eat on Thanksgiving, so unfortunately it did not wow us.,Last few things about this place, price range for each dish is from $7 - $20, and prepare to get several dishes since the majority of them are tapas style. Interior design is neat and clean, but there isn't as much seating inside as outside. Service is great too, very friendly staff! Other than that, I'd say if you ever want to dine vegan, then this is the place to visit!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/1/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Delicious vegan food! So happy to have stumbled across this place. I haven't been to many vegan spots yet, but i had a great experience at Glam. The watermelon ceviche was my favorite. The spaghetti + meatless balls and farro risotto were also really good. Definitely stopping by again to try a few other dishes :), -,Edit: since my review I've been back a few times and tried the Verde flatbread, Nachos, vanilla almond French toast and the Ube pie (purple sweet potato) - all very delicious"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/4/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Searched yelp for a great vegan place to dine this past weekend. Came across GLAM vegan. ,After seeing the photo of the pear flatbread it was love at first sight! ,A quick service type of place. Seating inside & out. Adorable cart near the front door with self-serve glasses, bottles for ""water pitchers"", flat water, sparkling water, & gold utensils! It added a nice touch.,At the counter they have a little display case filled with sweets! Pie, cookies & truffles.,The young lady handed us a brunch menu but I was all about those hot entrees! Side note the girls that sat next to us ordered the French toast! Not only did I want to photograph her food, but I wanted to stick my fork in & grab a piece!! It looked scrumptious!!,We ordered pear flatbread, veggie burger with slaw & spaghetti with meatless meatballs. I wasn't going to order a drink but since the sangria sounded so enticing I ordered a glass.  Sangria was a blend of sake, rose', pear & pineapple. I don't mind paying $9 a glass but I did ask if it was a decent size.... to my surprise when it came out it looked like a little shot in my huge glass! ,My husband & I looked at each other & smiled....,When we make sangria or usually get it it's a tall glass! In any case it was delicious. Just wish it was at least half way filled for $9.00. I wouldn't order that again....,Spaghetti dish was out of this world delicious! Portion was perfect. Plated beautifully I would 100% order this over & over! My husbands veggie burger was fantastic! Daughters flat bread was so unique! Every bit of wonderful! When you love & appreciate good food & stumble upon something wonderful you want to make sure people really know about it!!! ,Staff was so attentive & friendly! All smiles! ,We had an amazing experience They even sampled their daily soup which was black bean. Each day they feature a different soup. I really wanted to try a dessert but I was too stuffed lol,Highly recommend this place for everyone not just vegans! ,I came away with one question! When I return do I get what was so absolutely perfect or venture off and try something new ;-)~"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/24/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Pretty impressed with Glam. I have to say it's one of our new favorites in the vegan food world. The spaghetti is phenomenal and I was surprised the serving size was pretty substantial which was a definite plus. Not sure what the ""meat""balls are made of but whatever it was- more of that please. We also tried the tres leches and I was surprised to say I think I like it more than it's original dairy sibling. The ube pie is pretty glam for the 'gram and taste nice too by the way. ,Everything that we have tried has been exceptional and definitely has not lacked in flavor. Looking forward to soon returning and trying out the BBQ burger and the risotto!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"FIRE. I had the pesto pear pizza OMG AMAZING. also the tres leches??!?!? HEAVENLY. This place is high on my list of best vegan spots in Miami. ,My friends got the bbq burger I believe and the chickpea masala or something? The Indian dish was great but I personally didn't care much for the bbq burger"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"The food was so amazing. It is all vegan but it doesn't feel like you're eating vegan in that everything is extremely filling and the textures of the food mimic that of non-vegan food so well (like the ""cheese"" and the ""burger"").,I would 100% recommend the flatbreads and the avocado toast. The pear flatbread is amazing and I will come back to this restaurant just for that dish. Also the jackfruit taco was the best imitation meat I have ever had. I'm not convinced it's not real meat, it's so similar! ;) They also have pretty good sangria and desserts!,This is a casual inside/outside sit down place where you order at the register and then indulge at your table. Everything is eco friendly and absolutely delicious. The wait staff is super friendly too!,I am not a vegan - in fact, I am a meat-eater. But I would eat here more often than not if it were closer to my house. If I was gifted enough to cook this at home myself I would go vegan in a heartbeat."
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/22/2018,$$,4,GLAM Vegan,Probably my favorite go to vegan restaurant as I've tried many of their dishes. Everything is extremely delicious but I always come back for their purple Ube sweet potato pie which is so yummy. The ambience is great as you can sit inside or out. I prefer outside on days like today we're the music is good and so is the weather.
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/20/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"Deliciously filling vegan food located in Midtown. I'm not vegan myself but I do enjoy eating vegan dishes on occasion since they always make me feel so light and refreshed. I ordered the Chana Masala dish with chickpeas, mango chutney and quinoa. It came with a big crunchy piece too, not sure what it's called but imagine it being a really crunchy piece of roti. Either way, it was delicious. I didn't find it to be too spicy; however I eat spicy food so much that I probably didn't notice the heat. My friend ordered the zoodle salad with avocado and kale pesto, and the couple bites she generously shared with me were delicious! The kale pesto didn't taste bitter at all! ,For dessert, we ordered the choco-cado mousse and matcha tea custard - YUM! The mouse was very rich in chocolate, topped with pieces of crispy coconut and berries, and didn't taste one bit like avocado! As for the matcha tea custard, the green goodness was topped with passion fruit and mango cream, which made it a little tart but it was juuuust right. I chose to mix the cream on top into the custard itself so I could have a little tartness with each bite. Can't wait to go back!"
"3301 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/29/2018,$$,5,GLAM Vegan,"When a friend recommended vegan for a lunch spot my first reaction was... Eh, you can miss me on that one, I'm not a vegan. But I was surprisingly a fan of this feel good healthy lunch option!   The food was FRESh, made in house + most importantly tasty! ,I had a zucchini noodle pesto salad with the Harvest Squash soup of the day which was exceptional! ,The ambiance is intentional, the soundtrack makes you feel as if you are in a trendy yoga studio... which was both relaxing and fun.  ,A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, and this food is worth it."

"2423 Galiano St, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/4/2018,$$,5,Stephanie’s Crepes,Absolutely positively delicious crepes. Vegans: Order the Veggi Edamame (without the aioli); it does not disappoint! And the Protein Choco-Nana is made with Vega protein powder and almond butter...so good! And my bros loved Scrambled Eggs with Cheddar; they even ordered another after devouring the first!

I arrive with a couple of my aunt, cousin, and sister. The friendly staff of the location immediately welcomed us.,We share some empanadas and sauce for our appetizer. This is of the few times that I do not repeat the sauces, I don't know what they add to it, but the taste and texture were incredibly delicious. Las empanadas were good too, it saw like in Miami almost every restaurant know how to make homemade and traditional empanadas.,For my main plate, I order La Picaña (The Picanha) is a cut of beef that is very popular in Brazil. In the U.S. it is little known, but referred to as the rump cover, rump cap or culottes. North American butchers generally divide it into other cuts like the rump, the round, and the loin. ,I order this cut of the beef because I was told by my sister that is the best cut she has taste and she describes how delicious can be.  This cut is big enough to feed two people, it comes with two-piece of beef cut, the picanha was delicious! The meat was very tender, the flavor was wonderful, juicy, everything about the cut was perfect everything like my sister told me, I truly recommend it, more if you looking to share a plate with someone."

I love this place it's just a shame it's so far from me . I would totally be a fat ass if I wasn't.living in Homestead. the menu has a goood selection and a little pricey but they offer. 2 things with it quality and quantity so worth it  Do not bring you vegan friends here  I had the South Florida burger and loaded  tater tots. so yummy I dream about it. I'm a sucker for anything with Brie on it, but it doesn't stop there  they add pork belly , red onion marmalade  and truffle  aioli.....oh wait I added Bacon  Mind you all that sits on a burger. Then I added  loaded  tater tots comfort food at its best ladies and gents.  Bacon is a definite part of the menu and they offer it in everything including their drinks. I was not so brazen I was too involved in the main course . The food it's awesome and I cant wait to go back it's way better then anything Sunset place has to offer."
"5800 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",3/3/2017,$$,3,ROK:BRGR American Kitchen and Cocktails,"It's worth it on a Monday lol. Idk if it's worth the 20+ bucks each per person you know? Waiters are whatever. It has a nice aesthetic, clean. Unique burgers. Have yet to go for brunch though  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options. My favorite is the turkey burger. Fries are good."
"21 NW Miami Ct, Miami, FL 33128",6/4/2014,$$,5,Cane A Sucre,"It is important to note that I hardly take the time to write a review, but this jewel is worth every minute. I am a born again Vegan and their vegan sandwich tops every restaurant in downtown's radius. I used to go to Fratelli di Milano for their portobello sandwich and pay a bleeding $10.00, but  today I found my new love, CANE A SUCRE. I am so hooked on their menu, that I go through the stress of downtown traffic just to have lunch there. Miamians do not waste your time and money going elsewhere, this is the spot that will educate your palate."

"185 SE 13th St, Miami, FL 33131",1/31/2018,$$,5,Raw Republic,This is the best vegan restaurant in brickell by far! The service is incredible and the food is so delicious :)!
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2012,$,4,La Latina,"This place is super cute!  It is a small, unassuming place on the outside, but very warm, friendly and inviting on the inside! They use gluten free products and meat without any hormones, etc. and they are starting to serve vegan mini cupcakes from Bunnie's.  ,Hubs and I tried a variety of things - Pabellon empanada, cheese & sweet plantains empanada, the Reina Pepeida and the Pelua arepas.  My favorite was the Reina Pepeida arepa.  It's seriously filled to the brim with a creamy chicken salad (creamy from the avocado - heavenly!),The decor is like you stepped into your Abuela's (grandma!) house and you're plopping down at the kitchen table for an afternoon snack.  ,Tasty, cheap and fun."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We LOVE this place. The arepas are INCREDIBLE; it's fast, so cheap, AND they catered a big party for us and were extremely professional / organized / on-time. They even have a vegan/vegetarian menu (although, it's kind of lost on me.) They don't skimp on the meat/cheese and the sauces are OUT of this world."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/1/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We came here after the House of Roots kava bar. Although small, don't let it fool you, this place makes incredible arepas for various eaters from vegan to your average meat eater. My boyfriend had the beef arepa as did his friend. This was a nice stop along way before heading over to the Secret Garden Halloween party. I ordered the cheese and avocado arepa. It was so fresh and just mouth watering. We also shared the cheese sticks that his friend ordered. ,I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area even though I'm not a fan of where the restaurant actually is. We didn't have a hard time parking but it's in an area where cars are zooming past and since its Miami, of course, certain drivers can be a bit reckless from time to time. It also didn't help that it was raining like crazy. ,The decorations of this place are gorgeous. It reminded me of what it was like back when I visited Mexico. The colors were pastel and beige. Everything just blended in so nicely. ,I highly recommend bringing a date, a friend, or even a small group before going out or even during the day when it's nice and sunny since it'll be better. There's also a brewery around the corner where you can get a drink after enjoying the delicacies of some avant garde arepas."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/13/2018,$,5,La Latina,"This place is a hidden gem. I ordered the bean and avocado arepa and it was delicious. They have vegan options available. The place itself it's interesting, they have cute old fashion hispanic decorations that takes me back to my cuban childhood."
"1100 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/10/2017,$$,5,Ohho Noodles Market,"This place is a Asian/Western Fusion/Authentic Restaurant. It is a cozy place that a lot of people from college students to professionals come to eat. If you don't like eating when it is busy, get there early, for lunch 1130 or 700 for dinner. Ohho has a large variety of not just Asian dishes, but some Korean, French and Italian as well. The way they use the different cultural dishes, makes this place fun to go eat at. You pick from the menu and go pay at the register. The staff brings the food out and refills your drinks. Water is free and Refills are free for Regular Ice Tea. If you want dessert after, repeat the process. All of the food is fresh and has Gluten/Vegan dishes as well. My family and I enjoy coming here to eat. Ohho also has Free Wi-Fi."

I ordered my arepa with avocado and plantains, my husband ordered his arepa with black beans and avocado and a coffee. After we placed our order they let us know that they had no ripe avos! :( I'm part avocado so not having ripe ones is a big deal... We both had to settle for the black bean and sweet plantain arepas, which were pretty good just not what either of us initially wanted. ,Three stars for not having ripe avos AND for bringing my husbands coffee out after we had practically finished our arepas."

"117 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/15/2017,$,4,La Nonna Italian Restaurant,The food was decent. I'm also a vegan so there wasn't much option....but I was with a party of 3 and everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. I was recommend this place because of their affordable prices for great portions of food.
"97 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/4/2018,$$,3,La Moon Restaurant,The food is amazing. They even have some vegan options. The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because the server will take her time. It will take the server extra 20 mins to come back to you table. Ever time I need her I saw her chit chatting with a coworker. Had to even get up several times just to get her attention. Besides that the food is amazing. I recomend takeout if you don't want to wait.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/29/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Where do I begin? A friend recommended this restaurant. I came in and met Ruth and Damian, the owners, who were absolutely pleasant. I am not normally a ""vegan"" person, so I let Ruth guide the way as I ordered a few bowls to bring home to the family. ,At our table of five, we all agreed that the food was DELICIOUS. Each and every item--Korean Fried ""Chicken"", Chipotle Cashew, Creamy Combinasian--has its own distinct, bold flavor. ,I am adding this spot to my list of favorites."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/24/2018,$$,4,CombinAsian,"Happy to report, there's a new vegan kid on the block... Actually, CombinAsian it's our first vegan Asian restaurant in Sun City. We are living in modern times, my friends!!!,The place it's cozy and easy to find... No doubt, Wynwood is where most interesting things are happening right now.,Portions are huge and prices are super reasonable. They offered mostly bowls and Big Rolls. And ladies and gentlemen, the big rolls are on steroids: Enormous.  It's like a full meal rolled into pure goodness.,I tried the Tasty Teriyaki Big Roll for $9 . I chose jackfruit as my meatless protein, and  it comes with lettuce, red onions, carrots and green peppers mixed on a teriyaki sauce. It was delicious. But now that I'm thinking about it, the only missing items were wasabe, ginger and soy sauce to complete the 'sushi' experience. ,I'll definitely be back... This is exactly the type of food I'm craving after a night of drinks in Wynwood. ,Happy hour, anyone??"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/16/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"CombinAsian is where it's at! I tried this restaurant for the first time last week. Being a NON-vegan I was a little skeptical about whether or not vegan food would taste good and be as filling as my typical meaty meals. I first tried the Cilantro Lime Bowl. It was packed with fresh veggies and sautéed tofu and topped with a refreshing cilantro lime sauce. I was impressed with the balance of ingredients, the overall flavor, and the fact that I didn't miss eating meat with my meal! I enjoyed my meal so much so that I decided to go back later that week. This time I tried the Kim Bap Pow Roll, which was also fresh, delicious, and filling. I ate it with a side of fried kimchi that added just the right amount of spice to my meal. The awesome food is accompanied by friendly owners and a relaxed atmosphere to eat."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,This was my first time at Wynwood and I knew there were a few vegan spots I wanted to try and I happened to come across this place by accident and was so happy I did. My sister and I got the creamy CombinAsian bowl which filled us up so quick. It was really really satisfying and yummy. They also had Chloe cupcakes which were so amazing I fell in love. This place had pretty loud edm type music when I was there which was cool and they had different types of board games on the tables which was great so you're not on your phones.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/23/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Best vegan option I've had in the area so far. excellent KFC chicken. Cool spot. Get you crispy on. Filling and satisfying.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/7/2018,$$,4,CombinAsian,"my family and I stop by this place about eight days after it opened. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. The food that was available was excellent. Finding nice vegan macaroni and cheese is difficult but my kids asked for seconds at this place. ,We ordered three different bowls, all of which were fantastic. ,Being a new restaurant, there were a few things that are still being settled i.e. running out of rice. But overall the food is very tasty and we would definitely come back again if in Miami in the future.. The restaurant has a great concept and I hope more people come out to Wynwood to try it."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Let me start off with I'm not vegan or vegetarian just so you have a clearer understanding that literally anyone can stop by and enjoy a heavy or light meal. First time here and me not ever trying tofu I was blown away with the scramble I had rice beans scramble and some Korean noodles wow the options are amazing and the owners welcomed me in with open arms. The dumplings are FIRE as in good crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I will be back and thanks again for breaking down what everything is made with and all the preparation it takes to make a good vegan dish. P.S. load up on the pineapple sauce you won't regret take my word for it.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/25/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,I am so glad i found this place! This is the tastiest vegan food ever a must try for sure! I love the environment and the fact that they have wifi  i am def coming back
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/9/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Awesome little place, a little slow but they'll catch that rythm. Definitely worth checking out even if, like me, you aren't vegan."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/5/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Pleasantly surprised. I am not a vegan, but I enjoy fresh foods.  I went for the ""Super Bowl"" - a combination of many items. Delicious and fresh. The sauces we had were also amazing. Excited to try the rest of the menu!"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"My family and I checked out this place the other day and we're so glad we did! It's hard to find authentic Korean food in Miami and the potatoes, spicy pickled cucumbers and japchae (Korean noodles) were the closest to the real deal back home in DC! I love the Asian/Korean spin on vegan burritos and bowls. It's sometimes a hit or miss with vegan foods, but I'm trying to eat cleaner and this bowl right here didn't let me down! I'm definitely a sauce girl and tried all of them. All four were delicious but the teriyaki along with sesame dash complemented my bowl quite well. I got the tofu scramble, ginger broccoli and japchae in my bowl and shared the Korean braised potatoes and spicy pickled cucumbers with my sister and cousins. They ordered different burritos (kimbap and customized) and they were all delicious. The interior is really cute and I love the stadium style seats. I've only seen it a couple other times in DC and love the chill laid back yet hip vibe at this place. Did I mention there is also a DJ?! Only in Miami! So happy that Miami now has a spot for vegan/Asian/Korean food for when I visit my cousins and hope to see more Korean dishes in the future!"

But yes, I am vegan and I according to the cashier their whole wheat patties in the vegetable, callaloo and tofu variety are vegan! Unfortunately there weren't any tofu ones available when I went today but I had a vegetable and callaloo one and can you say FLAVOR EXPLOSIONNN! Would be a five-star review if they had more of a selection veggie/Ital-friendly food."
"7030 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2016,$,3,Dogma Grill,"good location, fast service, not to friendly service though, pricey for items selected.  i am vegetarian, i had the vegetarian dog, with onions and fries.  The dog tasted good, like a regular hot dog to me.  The fries we slightly above average tasting.  My diet is mostly raw vegan, I dabble into fast food sometimes and high quality fast food is OK for me to eat.  After eating here I got a 24 hours stomach ache, which is a sign of low quality ingredients.  The food was tasty and I'll give it another try.  I will update my review and remove the upset digestion part if it doesn't recur.  This place is right by my office, so I want it to workout lol."
"7030 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/31/2017,$,4,Dogma Grill,"First off , gotta say the vegan hot dogs here are still some of the best in town. They stay open semi-late (10pm ish) and food is prepared relatively quickly.My only issue with Dogma Grill is the callous cashier who can't seem to take an order without giving attitude. I ordered something VERY simple, had to repeat myself 3 times and she still got the order wrong at the end with a big side of attitude.At that point I was just annoyed and didn't care for her to try and rectify the order. I'll be back for some delicious hotdogs hoping she'll be in a happier mood."

Aaron was our server, an incredibly delightful, knowledgeable and professional man! He's truly a gift to the establishment. 2 of us were vegan, 1 vegetarian, and the other pescatarian. They were extremely vegan-friendly and accommodated everything to our preferences. The noodles, eggplant, and dumplings are to die for. It has a great ambience and very well designed. Thanks for an amazing time, we'll be back!!! 100% recommend!"

With their Granpa sauce (a VEGAN version of Big Mac sauce) which is to drool for. Love love love the vegan burgers so much I haven't gotten around to try anything else lol but I will!
"1040 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132",6/28/2018,$$,5,Almalibre Açaí Bar,"Place is an absolute gem. It has a chill theme and healthy vegan vibe, High quality ingredients, unbelievable açaí bowl ( Everest climber is my favorite). I love their chicken quesadillas and thin crust margarita pizza and their Mia and other bowls are top shelf."
"8841 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33176",2/10/2017,$,5,Gyroville,"I love this place! Everyone in my family loves this place! That's not an easy feat since there are 6 of us, and one is vegan, and another is vegetarian! I wish they had one further south. It's like chipotle, but with Mediterranean food! I rarely get to go since it's all the way in Doral. When I do go the food is great and the portions are big! It's very reasonably priced. The people aren't incredibly friendly, but I don't care. I go for the food, and it's not like you have to tip them. I'd go here every week, if I could!"

I am a vegetarian and got excited to see the that there is a whole section on avocado on the menu. First, basically everything under the avocado side sounds like the same thing besides the avocado halves and the wrap. I decided to try out the vegan pizza, which I honestly thought would be more creative than just a regular avocado toast. Also wasn't to tasty. On the up side great, friendly service."

My bill was $25 for these items and I felt that was a bit high. The restaurant is very nicely done inside, I will try it again."
"12590 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",1/19/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"Pincho Factory, no matter the location, always delivers! Each and every food item is a must-have. They are most popularly known for their Toston burger, but I love the Toston chicken sandwich with queso frito added the most. You can't go wrong with anything though. They are also vegan and vegetarian friendly with their veggie burgers or the rice bowls they have in a myriad of flavors (packed with plenty of veggies). I love the chimichurri bowl with chicken! Packed with bold flavor and the chicken is cooked just right. ,This location is one of the most recent that opened and they are consistent in terms of food quality and service. I love it here and highly recommend coming by for a burger or one of their rice bowls. ,You can also choose to buy sides separately. The tater tots are a huge hit (with good reason) and I suggest trying it with their cilantro aioli sauce vs the Apple butter it comes with. You won't regret it!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/15/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,So glad I found this please thanks to a good friend who recommended it. I had the chicken wrap and it was delicious!! Love that there are gluten-free and vegan options for my husband. He had the black bean wrap with hummus and loved it. The owner and staff are very friendly. Hard to find a great place these days with great customer service. Can't wait to go back and try more things.
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/31/2014,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"HIDDEN GEM! Just had lunch from this precious little spot and absolutely stuffed my face. You know how raw vegan usually leaves you wishing you were a tad fuller? Well my raw zucchini spaghetti hit the spot. It was like a deconstructed sun dried tomato hummus sans the tahini laid over a generous nest of dressed zucchini noodles. Very lemony and savory with the parsley and chickpeas. I'm satisfied!  the juice menu looks delicious too, you know I'll definitely be back for an açai bowl!!!,YES, total yes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/15/2016,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Cute little place that sells smoothies, salads, wraps & acai bowls.  Great for vegetarians & vegans.  My daughter order a monkey bowl & added stawberries to it.  They charge $0.75 for a to-go container.  I think the bowl was around $12.  It was a little pricey for the size but she enjoyed it.  A lot of the customers were regulars and knew to call ahead.  They still had to wait but no one complained.  Will come back to enjoy other items on the menu."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/21/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"FINALLLYYYYY a juice /acai / vegan options place in Pinecrest. Place is TINY; they def need to expand; and it's like 3 people working there so it gets crowded fast, but the menu is on-point, fresh, wholesome, and varied enough to satisfy plant/meat eaters alike. They'll customize anything. My only complaint is that they need to get a bigger space!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/25/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I was in the mood for something healthy in the midst of all this Black Friday craziness and what I found was an amazing tiny whole in the wall. This little treasure is heaven on earth for all you vegan/vegetarian/organic lovers. Now I see people complaining about the price, but you have to understand everything is organic, wild caught, non gmo, and REAL. The price should verify the authenticity for you, there's no way you're going to find a cheap all organic green place. It simply does not exist. But this place is worth the price, the wraps and juices are a good size and are all extremely filling. ,I had the soup of the day and a lentil wrap with hummus and it was soooo good! Filled with veggies and my tummy and body were so pleased. I also had the I Am Raw juice which is a green based juice that was also delicious. ,I can't wait to try their Acai bowls!! ,And the service was great. Very warm and welcoming and filled with good vibes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/22/2017,$$,4,Raw South Juice,Love this place! The only issue I've encountered is the inconsistency of the food sometimes my vegan sandwich  is amazing and then the next day it isn't the same ... it's still good but not as good
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",12/7/2016,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"I started going here because of some health concerns.  Now,  every morning I get a delicious green smoothie here and for lunch I get a large organic salad with chicken. They also have great healthy snacks like their acai bowls and they are raw vegan cookies and chips. I'm not a health freak and I usually do not eat organic or vegan but this place is really good. Everything I've had there including the green smoothie is delicious.  I usually order online at their website and then just go in and pick it up."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Raw has filled a void in Miami for high quality delicious plant based food! I love that they're veggies are organic so I can finally have a salad outside of my house and not have to worry about  nasty fumigation chemicals or GMO's. My favorite thing to get here is their daily special. Even if you are not vegetarian you will like it. They are bowl style and no matter what they are, they are delicious! My favorite is their vegan ""turkey"" picadillo and the black rice! The salad portion in the bowl is always tasty and unique.,The lady at the counter is such a sweetheart, immediately makes you feel welcomed and answers any questions you may have. She has the best energy and I love to see her when I come here.,Raw South is the perfect place to go when looking for healthy delicious food!"

The owner is so nice and always there which is a great thing because she oversees it all which in my opinion is the best thing to me it means she cares customers are always satisfied.,Everything is FRESH! ,The blueberry acai bowl is sooooo amazing and she makes it look  beautiful I don't even want to eat it lol ,I've also tried the smoothie almonds forever and it AWESOME!!! ,Today I had the veggie soup, I must say it was very good! ,Everything is a must try! ,Updated 11/30 ,Still love the delicious food but a little disappointed with the amount of veggies I got in my salad that was $11. I got a decent scoop of tuna but not enough of the other veggies. I got a pinch of carrot (granted there is carrots in the tuna salad maybe another vegetable can be added) and maybe 6 tomatoes cut in half with 7 cucumbers. I still think it's Delicious but a little more veggies would be awesome. ,I paid $25 for a smoothie (mango pineapple with no banana) which was pretty good, tuna salad, and 2 chocolate chip cookies."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/17/2018,$$,3,Raw South Juice,"The staff members are hard-working, knowledgeable, and pleasant. It's helpful to have a vegan-friendly place in this area. However, I found the menu difficult to navigate because it does not clearly indicate which items contain animal parts/secretions. Benign-sounding ingredients in the monkey açaí bowl, for instance, are not vegan. Note that their peanut butter chips contain milk and their granola contains honey. When in doubt, ask! The açaí mixture was satisfying--and very cold, so I added coffee (which they don't have) from the bakery next door. That bakery also had some vegan desserts, like dates with cacao. A lovely match, which you can enjoy on one of the communal tables outside. This outdoor atmosphere is convenient, yet hectic. Be prepared to enjoy your organics amid exhaust fumes and honking from the intersection where the Palmetto Expressway, SW 77th Ave, and US1 converge."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/23/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"Ugh! Juice bars and vegan restaurants are so misunderstood.,OK. Here is an explanation for prices. Everything is organic/non GMO. Some stuff is gluten free, and sugar is not used. Also, no animal products are used, unless you are getting a chicken/fish item. That includes ingredients like coconut/rice/hemp/soy/almond milk, vegan cheese, tofu, all that vegan/vegetarian stuff. And it also means raw/unfiltered honey, stevia root and other natural sweeteners. Don't take my word for it though. ASK!,But most important, it also means that the employees are getting paid a decent wage. ,I could keep going, but I will start going into more abstract subjects related to holistic healing and stuff like that. Anyway, the smoothies not only taste good, they make you happy. That is the power of organic foods, they deliver a different experience than normal produce.,Don't believe me? ,I guess you must try it then..."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",2/28/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I'm finally getting around to writing a review! This place is in my general neighborhood, so I come here often enough. Yes, it is a bit pricey; that is to be expected at an all natural, non-GMO, non-preservative, fresh produce and juices based restaurant. But the food is well worth it. It's a great place for health conscious people and vegans, vegetarians, and anyone in between looking for a place to eat lunch. My only complaint is that I wish they stayed open later. ,I like to bike here sometimes and munch on their veggie wraps, or slurp on their almonds are forever smoothie. They have a good selection of salads, as well. Their monkey bowl is pretty good too; it's a pretty big bowl so it's more fun to share with someone else. They also have the strawberry bowl, blueberry acai bowl (with almond butter is yummy), tropical acai, and other options. Their food is filling, and is definitely a favorite. ,They have bike parking, and car parking is in the lot. No wifi, but it's a great place to just sit and enjoy a book. It's usually pretty peaceful, so big groups aren't recommended. If you do want to be noisy, there is outdoor seating. ,Overall great experience, friendly staff, and aside from the above average prices and early closing hours, it's a great place to have lunch, brunch, an afternoon snack, early dinner after work-anything that fits your routine."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,5,Raw South Juice,Really delicious and fresh food as well as smoothies. Order took about 15 minutes. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for fresh vegan food. A little pricey but considering the freshness and and flavors it's well worth it
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",2/16/2017,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"As a newly found vegan I have been struggling finding restaurants that will satisfy my taste buds and dietary restrictions. What's awesome about Greenlife is that their food is delicious, healthy, and fast!  On top of that their staff is phenomenal. Every time I walk in I'm greeted with beaming smiles from everyone. ,Okay back to the food... I've eaten the black bean burger wrap each time I've been here. What can I say, I'm a creature of habit and once I find something I like it's hard for me to break free from it. It's savory, has a little kick of spiciness, and is filling! I know there are plenty more options I can choose from but for now I'm satisfied with this option :),I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for a healthy lunch spot. I'm sure I'll be back again soon!"
"909 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/21/2018,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"Love this little place!!! Would come here on my lunch breaks or whenever. They allow you to build your own bowl, which I think is so cool make ordering so easy the carrot cake is the bomb taste so good is vegan also delicious"

Yea !!so yummy! local beer and international la Estrella beer amazing , vegan ice cream option just perfect ! they even let my puppy sit w us outside . 100 points for them."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/21/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"I never really cared for pizza until I found Paulie Gee's octopus pizza. It is seriously INSANE. I know it sounds weird but only until you try it, absolutely deliciiious. And btw, their vegan pizza are also really good, try the vegan ricotta and vegan sausage!!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/17/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,5/5! I absolutely love the fact that Paulie Gees has a whole vegan menu and not only accommodates meat eaters. I tried the Vegan Greenpointer and it was okay but In Ricotta Da Vegan was amazing!! The faux fennel sausage was hearty and the arugula and cashew Ricotta went extremely well with the combo. Definitely recommend this place and will be back. Service was great and the pizza was out within 5 minutes of ordering it!
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The do a good pizza here at Paulie Gee's.  It's not Steve's or Dominos, so if you are in the market for those this isn't your place, but if you want high quality ingredients done in interesting combos you don't see everywhere this is your place.  Add to that a very warm, unique environment and a friendly staff from the owner on down, and Paulie Gee's is a can't miss in Mimo.  You have to check out the octopus pizza, the BBQ Brisket pie and the vegan tomato sauce.  Check it out!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/12/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"So far so good, due to my ball and chain I've only had the Vegan pies but they've been fantastic every time. I'll eventually try the regular pies but I have to say the dough at this place is some of the best I've had. I def recommend giving this place a try"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,The vegan pizza was really good. I asked for a little bit of arugula the whole d@*m pie was full with arugula. When I picked off the greenery I had enough for a salad. The vegan cheese was great and the sausage was fantastic. Next time I need to try the dessert
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/7/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing Pizza, Service and alAtmosphere. The Chef talked to us since it wasn't that busy and he was so polite just wanted to know how we liked everything. We had the Vegan Pizza that came with HOUSE MADE  vegan sausage and ricotta cheese once again AMAZING! Will be coming back FOR SURE!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/28/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Love love love this place! It just opened and we have already returned three times. My boyfriend has recently turned vegan due to health restrictions but it's been a blessing in disguise. We have discovered holes in the wall places and experimented with off the beaten path dishes. We LOVE this place in particular for their vegan pies. The crust with the perfect char is what dreams are made of and the cashew ricotta dollops give me life! Inventive combinations of ingredients were meticulously arranged so substitutions are discouraged, I get that having lived six years in Italy the Italians too are very methodical in regards to the flavor arrangement leaving little to no room for changes. Don't take it personally, it's a science! Just walked out the door and already planning my return trip. ,I don't get way people are bashing this place on Yelp and my mind is blown by the comparison to Steve's Pizza and Spris... I have no bad reviews to pass onto either of those places but they aren't even in the same pizza league as Paulie Gee's. ,Try it! Forget all you know about junk-fast food pizzas... this place is purely for the artisanal pizza lovers!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/14/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing pizza with a great aesthetic. Seriously good pizzas and craft beer in an old Chinese restaurant that has been gutted but preserved. Lots of really cool Street art adorns the walls. They offer great vegan options as well, off street parking and good vibes."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/19/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The moon and stars were aligned tonight my friends. The mood, vintage china palace sign, and my appetite could only agree. The twinkle in her eyes gave me confidence we were in the right establishment. It was truly a magicaL experience. From vegan fennel sausage with cashew ricotta dipping sauce to a nicely portioned red, white, and greenpeaCe piZZa, Paulie Gee's came through in the clutch to say the least. My man Jason even gave us a run down of their trademarked triple proofed process of dough making. Can you say 95% gluten free crust? That's a true dough master if you ask me. Jason I will lend you my magical red boujee robe for some magical boujee vegan sausage. ,A simple candle light ambience was all that was needed to put the official stamp on a one of a kind dining experience. Hash tag magic happens here..."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/8/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"This is probably some of the best pizza in Miami, and hands down THE BEST vegan pizza in Miami. So happy to have found Paulie Gee's! Not to mention the awesome staff."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/3/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie Gee's is one of my top 3 favorite places for pizza. Me and my wife drive all the way from Ft. Lauderdale just to have their pizza. They make excellent Neapolitan style pizza with a vegan twist (they serve both vegan and non-vegan pies). Their house made vegan sausage and cashew ricotta cheese is amazing! Also, the place itself has a really cool vibe and great for a couple's night out. My only ""complaint"" is that they do not accept American Express."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2018,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've driven by this place a bunch of times, but stopped in for the first time tonight. My partner can't eat dairy, and we were told that they have a good vegan pizza, so we thought we'd finally give it a try. Her pizza was delicious! I got the spinach pizza with garlic and it was awesome! The crust was perfectly crispy and chewy, fresh from the wood burning oven. The veggies were super fresh. The ricotta I added was creamy and tangy and a wonderful addition. Service was SUPERB - which is so refreshing to experience in Miami. We'll definitely be back!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/24/2018,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've ordered a couple times from Paulie Gee's. Mostly because it's a close and quick delivery when we're hungry. We've tried a vegan (In ricotta da  vegan) and a regular pizza (Green Pointer) and both were ok. Not your regular cheese slice and they have a creative twist on ingredients.  I like the chewy crust but need to try other options , next time one with more sauce.  The two I've gotten have had a lot of arugula. Too much that you can't really taste any of the other ingredients or flavors. Find it a bit pricey for these gourmet pizzas. It's not the New York Pizza I was expecting but I get what they're doing.    Also, ordered the eggplant parm which contributes to the 3 stars. Super disappointed. There must of been only 2 or 3 slices of eggplant and such a small portion for $22. I shouldn't of assumed that $22 meant an entree , the portion was more like an appetizer. I should of know better than to order eggplant parm from a pizza place.  Ironside pizza is close by and I personally think a better option."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/16/2014,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,The staff is really friendly and they have the best view in Doral . The selection is very healthy. The pizzas are well done and the salads are delicious . They serve almost everything in to go plastic bowls and cup. I love this place I just wish they were more Eco friendly and have more vegetarian/vegan options ( vegan cheese would be great)
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",12/21/2015,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Healthy and tasty food. Multiple choices for the vegan/healthy conscious oriented eater. ,Friendly service, nice location with a pretty view and they cater and deliver! ,Delivery is fast and accurate. ,Regular customer; will indeed go every day!   ,Will love for them to have a frequent  customer program... ,Great place! Love it!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/8/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Great spot! Healthy. Fresh food. Good view of the water. Would love to see more vegan options, but otherwise A+! :)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/10/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Delicious, great service and chill vibe. We had the avocado tuna salad and vegan colorful salad. Both very yummy. My kids had the pumpkin soup and adashah bowl, which they enjoyed. This was our first visit, but we will be back to try out more if the menu."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie gees delivers excellent, creative, flavorful pizzas in a scenic, art filled establishment. The staff is friendly and the variety is out of this world. I appreciate their vegan pizzas and desert options. I saw the dominoes across the street and couldn't help but laugh at how much more authentic this pizza is. How'd they manage to fit so much creativity into one business?! Do yourself a favor and try this!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",3/2/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,So healthy and so delicious I cant stop eating. Vegan options and all natural and very fresh. Staff is very sweet and welcoming. Love this place.
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/16/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Vegan Nutella pizza... NUFF said. ,This place keeps it real, NY style pizzas right on Biscayne blvd baby. Love the passion and character that PG's gives off, from the funky art all over to the beautiful leopard charred pizza crust. ,The owner also has a strong background in NY style pizza and when you mix that skill with catering to vegans; well... what you get is pure art. Homemade cashew ricotta, homemade vegan fennel sausage, Vegan Nutella pizza? Come on who even thinks of these things? Nucking futs.,Oh, and it's BOGO pizza every Wednesday + karaoke. ,Yes, You're welcome."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/24/2017,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Tried one of the vegan pizzas. ,Pros: ricotta is delicious, dough is excellent and perfectly cooked. Sauce is fresh and yummy. ,Cons: entirely too much arugula. Enough to make a side salad. ,I paid $3.00 to add mushrooms to my pizza and got a couple of stems. Total rip off. ,Also ""sausage"" was very sparse. Pretty yummy so I wish there was more."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Awesome service. Such a cool and funky spot, bring friends who are into that. Vegan here-- awesome vegan pizza and the cheese is actually good and unique! Vegan nutella pizza!!! Have yet to see that elsewhere, give it a try. Non-vegan approved too!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/22/2016,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Hey! What do you know? Vegan pizza?,A friend of mine told me about Paulie Gee. I searched in my database and I remembered the NY pizza guy that is pretty famous in NY, actually had won some of the best pizza awards over there. ""Yes, that's the guy"", my friend told me. And with that introduction, I move on to my review.,The space is brand new, and it sits few people (as of the date on the review). One community table for about a dozen, and three tables for about another dozen. If you don't mind eating at the bar, I am sure you don't, then add another dozen more. At the bar, they serve local beers from MIA, Wakefield, Funky, etc, so that is a big plus for the pizza/beer combo.,The pizza is pretty good, but it is hard to rate. The toppings and the combinations are really good, and the dough is burnt and chewy. The pizza sauce is delicious, the cheeses are really good quality, but the dough may feel pedestrian and average. It has a very subtle flavor that is really hard to catch. I would compare it to naan bread, but it tastes like pizza. The good thing about it is that you can fold it easily (it actually folds itself!), and you can chew on that stuff forever, on and on and on.,The salads are excellent, and they have many vegetarian choices. Also, they have a whole list of vegan pizza which I found very enticing.,The people here are very friendly, very humble. The kitchen is just an open oven, with locals working around diligently. I really liked the atmosphere.,Big plus: One retro pinball machine in the back. Drop a dollar."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/22/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've eaten here a couple of times and overall the food is hit or miss, and the service is a little on the slow side. Parking definitely sucks but it is one of the only places offering so many healthy choices especially for people who are vegan/vegetarian/gluten free. The avocado toast is good but there have been times I've gotten a soggy piece of bread with the smallest crumbles of goat cheese on top. Definitely give it a try, especially if you are trying to eat healthy or looking for vegan options! It's a little on the pricey side but everything in Miami is."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",7/20/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"On a vegan kick lately and this casual high quality food concept is great. I love this trend of healthy food done right places to eat.,I had a pumpkin soup and a super foods salad. Really clean and fresh flavors with combinations I've never had before.,Price is fair considering ingredient quality."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2017,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I'm sure that vegans/gluten free people around the world as over joyed over this place! It is very creative and has a variety of items on the menu. However, if you are not vegan, gluten free, low calorie and are on vacation wanting to eat ALL of your calories- choose another pace. Lol. This was great- but this week I am not counting calories so I was an it underwhelmed that was my fault none of the restaurants. Most of the waiters speak Spanish but our waiter was nice explained the menu and we got a picture of mimosa. Oh and the outside view is great(part of the reason why I stayed even though the menu was looking a hit healthier than I anticipated)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/22/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,AWESOME for a gluten free and vegan diet in an area where my options are all fried nonsense and heavy dairy. LOVED this place. Kind service too!
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/6/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,Small place on the lake in Doral.  Very fresh food with good service and decent prices.  They have many Vegan options  which I've tried and enjoyed very much.  I highly recommend for lunch in Doral.  Check in via Yelp for a free glass of wine.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/6/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"The place is a little crowded due to its small size, but just go outside and enjoy the beautiful deck they have in the back looking to a lake. The food is nice, I ordered a tuna salad, then we ordered smoothies, but I think that the salads neither any plate they offer is to eat in the restaurant. Everything is served in plastic containers. All the drinks came in plastic containers also, not to environmentally friendly in a restaurant where vegan people and green people come to eat. Other wise the experience was nice, a little bit slow the service to get your initial order but after that everything is fast."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,"We decided to visit Delirio Fresh on a Saturday late afternoon for a juice and a wrap. Their menu had many vegan and gluten free options to choose from and we were excited to discover a juice place that had so many food options. ,We ordered a Green Love Juice from the Green Juices section of the menu which has kale, spinach, cucumber, mint, ginger, and lime. We also ordered a Vegan Love Wrap and an herbal tea. While they were out of herbal tea I was pleasantly pleased that the waitress was able to provide me a small sample that was delicious! ,The wrap was good with a hearty amount of roasted vegetables and the portion size was generous. They offer gluten free wraps however, on this visit we chose the spinach wrap. ,The Green Love ""Juice"" was NOT a juice at all. Instead, what I received was a smoothie . Upon reviewing the menu again, the picture does look more like a smoothie than a juice. Furthermore, I missed the note that they're sweetened with Stevia .  Needless to say, it wasn't what I expected and I would not return with the expectation of having a juice here. ,The service was good, the menu variety is great, the ability to dine on their patio with a view of the water is nice. We'll likely be returning to try other menu items. Overall, I'd recommend giving this venue with plenty of vegan gluten free options a chance at least once. ,Happy Eats!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/30/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Had to go to Doral for school, and had to check out Delirio Fresh while I was there! I was completely surprised by the gorgeous outdoor water view. I first heard of the restaurant from Instagram, and I'm a huge healthy food fan, so I was excited to come and try this restaurant. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order, because all of the menu items looked delicious here. This doesn't normally happen to me as a vegetarian who likes flavorful and healthy food! I eventually settled on the Low Carb Vegan Bowl, which contained adashah (locally produced vegan based lentil protein), roasted veggies, mashed roasted pumpkin, avocado, chopped cilantro, sesame seeds and Delirio vegan dressing. I loved it, and found it reasonably priced. Also discovered when I was here that they have a location in downtown Miami, which is very close to me! It's called Delirio Fresh express (not exactly sure what makes it express), and I can't wait to try it! If you like plenty of creative healthy options at a reasonable price, and/or a nice setting to meet with friends, Delirio Fresh is your place!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/20/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Definitely a phenomenal option for people that like healthy and/or vegan food. This is a 5 star food and rockstar place with such a great lake view!!!! The only star that I can add there is the parking....... is few more business attached to their place so please be sure you wait in line for parking or park right in the front of the restaurant. If the bars beside or shops see you walking to the restaurant they are not friendly because is a very limited parking options. So sad because food and the place is AMAZING!!!'
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/28/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Great place for healthy alternatives. I'm vegan and had a few choices to pick from which is usually not the case. I went for the veggie sandwich without the cheese on gluten free bread and it was scrumptious! The water view in the back makes the place even more inviting! Will definitely be my go to place in Doral!
"601 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/6/2018,$$,5,La Centrale,"One of my overall favorite dining experiences ever occurred at Stagionale, the vegetarian/vegan restaurant in La Centrale. The entire experience was premium and holistic. The staff was friendly and we were checked up upon the perfect amount of time- not too much nor too little. The manager and owner thanked us for the patronage and made sure we enjoyed our experience and the server was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. ,The food was amazing starting with a kimchi shot for digestion. We decided to do 1 miami spice menu but chose both the jackfruit tacos and a side of edamame sliders. The entree for the miami spice was the gnocchi which was also good. The waiter suggested the carbonara with bacon tempeh (not on the menu) and it was one of the best vegan dishes I've had in my life. The dessert was also good as well. It ended with pills of turmeric and wheat grass and the experience has me craving more... we'll be back! ,P.S. 18% gratuity was added at the end but the service was definitely worth it,P.P.S. The menu was recently changed a few days before our visit and it is great!"
"59 W 3rd St, Hialeah, FL 33010",12/13/2015,$$,5,La Fresa Francesa,"My first time in Hialeah and I loved it! My favorite part of visiting the city was eating here. The staff was attentive,courteous and more than helpful. The owners were more  accommodating for me being that I'm vegan and created a masterpiece that tasted just as good as it looked.,The owners are so hospitable and really care about your experience at their restaurant and go above and beyond to help even create something that works with your diet. They also recommended an antique store and it was a double win for me. It had such a vast collection of all types of antiques and they were actually very well priced and realistically . The lady who owns it was more than friendly as well.,All in couldn't have made a better choice but to eat here. The decor inside is so well embellished with accenting pieces that all work beautifully  together to create a place that almost feels like you aren't in Florida, anymore .  Everything was thought out from when you first walk in to even the ornate tableware  itself .,I really Loved my whole Hialeah experience !"
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/7/2015,$$,4,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"The place is small, and just what I wanted. It was a yelp find, and I couldn't be happier. They have vegan/vegetarian options, which is fantastic. They have wine, beer & tequila for their Margaritas. Right away, I was enamored with this restaurant. You wouldn't think the food would be so good. But it is, it's a Mexican hole-in-the-wall in the middle of Cuban Westchester. Go, try it, you'll love it."
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/20/2015,$$,5,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"Excellent food, and for a vegan very accommodating when I asked for no cheese or sour cream. Only set back which I did not count against them; was the poor girl was running around as the only employee besides the kitchen staff. Very quaint and fairly quiet and intimate for a date night.  It is small so don't be deceived by the first impression."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/31/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A hidden jem in Wynwood, Miami. After being really disappointed in another restaurant (Kiji Cuzco) in Wynwood my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Love Life Cafe. From the moment I entered even after being starving and cranky from the last place I was in complete bliss the aura alone made me happier. The cafe offers a great vegan selection and Miguel (the cook and waitress) was such a cheerful person  to speak to. It was my boyfriends birthday and I really wanted to treat him to a nice meal. Being that we're both vegan it's difficult to find a place that we could eat anything on the menu and this place for filled this, as well as make filling food anyone would enjoy. I ordered the Plant Powered Arepas (they are to die for) and my boyfriend ordered the Best Burger (I have never tasted a better burger). There's Holistic health and Yoga I wish I was here longer to take advantage of! Overall great environment and vibes."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,best vegan spot in wynwood! the burger is honestly better than a lot of regular burgers i've had. new favorite!
"78 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/14/2017,$$,4,The Lunchbox,"Great place with high quality ingredients. Not for everybody though. Their dishes are rich in raw vegetables and natural kind of flavors. With their organic-local concept, it deserve the visit. All the beef is grass fed, the chicken is cage free and the pork is humanely born and raised. Vegetables are from local farms that guarantee the freshness of the dishes. Highly recommended for organic, healthy, vegan and gluten free customers!"

Best Vegan Burger around by far. 100% vegan menu so you dont have to worry . Place has such an awsome energy and vibe dont take my word come find out your missing out.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This food was amazing. A great variety of vegan food and I was in heaven haha. My husband had the Veggie Burger and he said it was extremely good. It was gone very quickly. It came with sweet potato fries with cilantro garlic aioli that was VERY good. I ordered the Walnut Lentil Tacos and was extremely impressed. We each ordered smoothies that also tasted fresh and delicious. No complaints at all. ,You order at the checkout line and they bring the order out to your table. Very relaxed and casual environment."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/29/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I love the food here! I usually get delivery since its near my office. The Love Life Salad is great! I also love the Taco Salad. Both are incredible salad option. Curry lentil soup is pretty good, although on some days its better than others. This doesn't bother me though because that means they make it fresh everyday! The zucchini noodles and meatless meatballs are also my favorite. The sweet potatoes fries are really good too. They taste baked, so not too oily. Can't say anything negative, the food is amazing and I feel great eating so many veggies. I'm not actually vegan, I just enjoy vegan food!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/24/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Amazing food. Good vibe. Try the Crema (cashew cream) with whatever you order. It's delicious. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but this place has become a favorite.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great vegan restaurant with a little shop!,Well organized space with a high ceiling.,The waiters are really friendly and ready to give advices and little extra herbs or anything.,Ingredients are fresh and prepared in front of you. There's also a good range of choices for a vegan place!,Good pop music.,Only downside is the location a bit out-centered and near the highway but you don't feel it inside."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/19/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,I really love this place even though it is pricey! The arepas are my absolute favorite and I love the desserts that they offer! My husband (who is not a vegan or vegetarian) said the burger is one of the best burgers he's ever had!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/20/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,AMAZING vegan food. My favorite by far is the award winning vegan burger.. definitely recommend even to my non-vegan friends!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I would of never found this place if not have trying yoga here! But they have the most delicious vegan food, the menu is well thought out, the ingredients are super top notch, its a super homey feel, the salads are amazing, and the burger is literally the best! Its also pretty convenient and quick considering its made to order right in front of you! LOVE everyone and Love Life Wellness they feed your belly and your soul ;)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Tastiest vegan pizza and burger, and the salads are ummmazzinng!!!! Everything is soo good and fresh, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/12/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"One of the BEST vegan places I have ever visited! Delicious bowls, great service and chill, yogi ambience! Definitely recommend it and will come back during my stay in MIA, I love love life!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"As vegan meals go, these people got it right. Fresh made on the spot. Wholesome ingredients and well balanced flavors. Really good. ,  Warning: from the outside you see yoga sign and the symbol that's it, had to double check, but when I went inside the place clearly was a studio for gathering with the kitchen being more an added bonus, but WOW, great bonus."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/30/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Don't walk - RUN - to Love Life Cafe. Tried it out today with a friend who is more vegetarian/vegan for lunch today and was super impressed! The lentil curry soup is TO DIE for and I literally want them to sell it by the gallon so I can eat it every day. I also had the Love Life salad which was HUGE and so filling. I could have just ordered a side salad with the soup or just the big salad and been fine. Service was amazing and it is a whole wellness center. Looking forward to trying more of the great food and trying the other non-cafe services that they offer. Will be back!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A little hard to find but trust me, well worth the find ! The food was amazing and delicious ! Highly recommended this place for a great vegan lunch !"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/7/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,I ordered  my lunch on UberEATS from love life cafe. I had the burrito which came with a small salad and I also purchased a cookie for dessert. Everything was delicious! I could only finish half of the burrito and left the other for left overs for later. I will definitely be going to the cafe to check out the ambiance and try more of their delicious vegan food!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/14/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Happy to be the first review for this hidden spot in wynwood. Although I am not a vegan, I try to focus in low processed - plant based foods. The arepas and the tacos were very good. And the Kale salad was awesome. Friendly staff and cool looking center."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This veggie burger is seriously delicious. It's actually become a problem that I live only a mile away and become a regular. In adventurous moods, I've also tried the incredible pizza (best vegan pizza I've ever had) and pulled jackfruit sandwich, which was similarly delectable. I won't lie that the prices are a little steep, but the ingredients and care with which everything is prepared makes it worth the price. The staff are all friendly and the space is interesting. Ultimately, do yourself a favor and go because you won't be disappointed by the burger (if you're vegan or otherwise)."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/20/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"REALLY like this place, not quite 5 stars, but still really yum. I am happy to finally see the vegan food scene starting to gain some sustainable traction in Miami - it has taken a LONG TIME.,That said, not all vegan food is health food per se. So, you still have to be conscious of what you are eating.,Overall, I think Love Life provides a solid balance of healthy vegan food with indulgent vegan food. The prices are a little high, but not extreme. (Except for the bottled drinks - those markups are pretty extreme),So far we've tried the veggie burger (*really good* Best in America? ), Walnut meat tacos (tasty, very filling, but pretty bland), the arepas (also great, super filling, but missing spice) and The cuban burritto (ditto).,The sides really stand out as the most well seasoned and delicious - the kale salad and the sweet potato fries are winners.,My biggest desire for the food here - is for it to have more flavor. To play more with seasoning, textures and sauces. (Vegan ""aioli"" is as over-played (and unhealthy) as the real thing.),I have not tried any of the desserts yet. But they are on the list!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/17/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"This place quickly caught my eye as more than just a vegan cafe but a wellness center. They offer spiritual talks and yoga classes which I appreciate very much. I think its very commendable for a food place to get involved in the community going above and beyond by showcasing what they preach. ,The place is on the corner of 27th and 6th. Its a huge 2 story place with couches and large tables to host large groups. They also have a large studio for their yoga classes and not sure whats upstairs. ,I came around 9 am on a Monday morning for a few hours and the first thing I tried was their bodytek smoothie which is a green smoothie with  vanilla vega protein. It was good but didnt leave a lasting impression. I would have gotten a cold press juice if I went back. ,For food I ordered El Burrito and their award winning vegan burger. El Burrito was great! Fresh lettuce and beans with a nice cream sauce- got it for a nonvegan and he loved it! ,The burger comes with sweet potatoes and a salad. I must say the burger was THE BEST vegan burger i have ever had! The vegan cheese wasnt too smokey and the burger was exceptional. It was delicious! Highly recommend! Loved it ,The reason I give it a star less is because of the service. The 2 people behind the counter making the food were great, freindly, and very helpful but I couldnt help but notice there were so many people who seemed to  work there. There was about 5 or 6 people going behind the counter grabing cups and puting things away all without acknowledging me. Very very laid back environment. Mind you I was the only customer buying food there and I was there for 2 hours...,In fact while the young lady was making my food a women by the name of Veronica kept interruping her to ask her questions about stock and if she put the kale away etc..All food prep talk that should be taken care of when there is NOT any customers around and esp when the customers food is being prepared, please let her focus on the magic she is making. ,Meanwhile, there was an artist walkkng around placing his artwork and another young guy rearranging the flowers as if they just opened this week. Then I ask and they have been open for a year! I think decorating and food prep should be done behind closed doors or before the place opens. And awknowledge your customers!,I think this place is really on to something with their concept of full body all around wellness and off the wall food. I just think with a little more organization and better customer service it'd be just right."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow, we found our new favorite Vegan Cafe. That didn't take long at all. Either did our wait for perfect clean food. Wow. ,Curry Lentil soup, a super clean veggie soup. Carrots and celery added perfectly. A veggie burger on a pretzel bun with massaged kale, incredible. Moist and so well balanced. The hummus and dressings are perfect and the baked spicy sweet potato fries (not fried) JUST WOW WOW WOW! ,Pictures will be added next time we go!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"By far my favourite vegan cafe in Miami. I'm celiac and now vegan as a result of health issues. I've ordered from here twice in the last two days on Uber eats and have received BEYOND what I asked for. All meals are exactly as ordered with accommodations made, and the staff is SO kind. I cannot wait to stop by in person and pay them a visit. Everything is local, organic, and made in house (a rare find for food that arrives so quickly). This to me, seems more like a movement than just a cafe which I truly have a lot of respect for. Keep it up, and keep loving life"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Best vegan place in the wynwood area! Fun, creative spot where they do yoga/wellness classes. Lots of gluten free options as well. I'm not vegan, but thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Big portions!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My first time coming & it won't be my last. I'm always in search of a great vegan/vegetarian spot, and this one made it to the list. I had the avocado toast with the kale salad on the side. I was speechless, the flavors came together perfectly. I will recommend this spot to my friends : ) ,(A plus: you can take yoga classes in the second floor)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/15/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Good was amazing! Had the vegan burger with gluten free bread - super yum! My husband had the Cuban wrap and he loved. Can't wait to go back!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great spot in Wynwood! They have really tasty Vegan options and you wouldn't even know how healthy this food really is, cause it tastes so good. Don't expect super fast service if they are busy, but its worth any wait time!"
"2960 SW Coral Way, Miami, FL 33145",7/3/2016,$$,5,Jardim de Portugal,"My husband had a craving for bacallao so we came here. They did not disappoint. I'm vegan and they actually had a small vegetarian menu. I ordered the rice with vegetables and it was absolutely delicious. The food was excellent,so was the wine and the service.  Definitely coming back here. No hassle to park. Free parking right next door."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/24/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My latest favorite vegan restaurant. As a foodie I think it's important that even healthy vegan foods should taste great. Not ""good for being vegan or healthy"" and unfortunately sometimes healthy and/or vegan food lacks flavor. This is NOT the case for Love life.,I've been coming here since I tried their best veggie burger at a veggie burger battle last year.,They continue to experiment and improve their menu. ,Located in Wynwood this is a shared space with a yoga studio(studio is located upstairs). It's a casual boho vibe with one large communal table and a few small tables. My current favorite is the chamo bowl which is listed under their specials menu (temporary menu) near the register. It's a latín inspired bowl filled with brown rice, black beans, shredded seasoned jackfruit that looks exactly like pulled meat, plantains, avocado and some delicious sauces drizzled on top. I'm salivating as I write this btw. I hope they never remove this from their menu because it is delicious. In addition they have veggie burgers, salads, bowls, pizzas, soups, acai bowls, smoothies and desserts. There is something for everyone. Keep sharing the  love, love life we see you! ,P.s they teamed up with happy vegan bakers and are now offering some of their pastelitos . Does life get any better than this?"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/7/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This is hands down the best vegan restaurant I've been to in Miami. The service was on point. Everyone was super nice. The food was out of this world. The tacos were the perfect combination of spices. The gluten free Mac and cheese was moist, cheesy and delicious. Kale salad was perfect. Sweet potato fries were fantastic with this amazing sauce that I couldn't get enough of. You will not be disappointed. This is my new vegan spot. Oh AND dog friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This review is based solely off my experience with Love Life Cafe via Uber-eats because I have YET to visit the actual location, but they've easily become my go-to vegan spot when I want to order takeout. I've had a few items from their menu and they were all great: the best veggie burger in america (delicious flavor for a plant based burger), the pizza Diabola (first vegan pizza i tried and i'm hooked) and the Pizza Verde (also very delicious and healthy). I need to stop by in person soon :)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2018,$$,3,Love Life Cafe,"I was really excited about this place and I'm not going to say it's not a good spot, but I will say it is pricey and there might be better options out there.  I had the best vegan burger in America and while I felt the title was optimistic I had other feelings about it.  I've been to several vegan restaurants so I feel I have the right to compare.  I'm very happy to see this type of restaurant in the Wynwood area and I'm happy to see that it's a community type place.  I would love to see freshly brewed ice tea or other drinks here and not just everything in a bottle.  Good menu and certainly a place to start for someone trying to make the switch or trying something new.   Closing it out at a 3.5 rating."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/22/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Following a doctor's appointment at Boscom Eye Clinic (eye surgery), my husband and I desired some good 'ole vegan food. I conducted a Yelp search and found Love Life Café, so we jumped in the car and headed about 3 miles away. As we drove I became a little nervous by the neighborhood, but didn't say anything as my husband couldn't really see after his doctor's visit. Had he been able to see he would have said, ""keep on driving"". I am one that is up for interesting places to eat, so I thought it would be fun to eat in a place located in an industrial park that was probably once a garage to fix cars. ,I was pleased with the décor. It is an open space with couches, chairs and tables. They do all sorts of classes during the week, so would be an interesting place to go outside of the food. That being said, on to the food....,I placed our order at the counter and sat down. I ordered a ""cheeseburger"" and my husband a regular Best in the World or something like that, burger. it was delivered rather quickly and was absolutely delicious. My ""cheeseburger"" was better than my husband's ""best in the universe"" burger. I wasn't overly happy with the fries as they were limp, apparently they needed a good dose of Viagra.,I would have loved to give them a 5 star even with the ED fries; however, the customer service was lacking. When we walked in the young man at the front desk didn't say one word to us. As I mentioned earlier my husband had an eye appointment and was unable to see so I had to read the menu to him. I then had to guide him to the table so I told the cashier to give me a minute and I would come back and order. He looked as though he could have cared less...and didn't say one word. No ""what can I get you"", no ""no worries"". Nothing. It wasn't just the lack of verbal communication it was his presence. He acted as if he could have cared less that we were there...and in fact there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant so I would hope they would want their staff to be extra friendly. ,We had an opportunity to go back the next day since we had a follow-up appointment but decided to give another restaurant a try and experienced better customer service."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Ooooooommmmmmmggggggggg. Came here with my girlfriend because she's vegan and I'm not. OMG amazingggg. I will start eating here regularly. Take outs etc .... you need to come to this place ...
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/10/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow! Hands down the Best veggie burger Ive ever had. I'm always looking for new vegan/vegetarian places and this is definitely in my top favorites. ,Really awesome spot, small menu and the food is just really good - flavorful, and best of all healthy...the veggie burger, wraps and salads are all great. The vegan carrot cake is outstanding.,My least favorite thing are the arepas. They were really bland tasting, texture was just layers of mush. I added hot sauce for more flavor. All in all love the food, staff is super friendly will be back!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/21/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Just passing through Miami and was looking for a vegan restaurant. Thanks to Yelp we found this gem!  Food was fresh and delicious. Staff was very friendly. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable. I had the pizza verde and my daughter had the sunshine spice smoothie both were awesome!  If you are in the Wynwood area, check them out. PS-they are also pet friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Love life cafe is the best began cafe in Miami! The menu items are unique and priced reasonable considering they are organic  & have a gluten free option. Super tasty and always fresh. Don't expect your food to be out in 5-10 minutes if you're in a rush. They take their time to prepare a delicious meal but trust me you won't regret the wait!! The desserts are to die for especially the vegan carrot cake YUMMM!!!
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/21/2017,$$,4,MIAM,"Best breakfast/brunch of my recent trip to Miami. Very cute cafe in the super trendy/hipster Wynwood area. You order at the counter but there is table service. The menu featured several gluten free, dairy free and vegan options. The coconut chia pudding topped with nuts and fruit was even tastier than it was beautiful (and you'll probably agree that it is quite Instagram worthy). My only small complaint was the cold brew was terrible. I'm hard pressed to call a coffee terrible as someone who loves coffee so maybe it was an off day? Regardless next Miami vacation will no doubt include a visit to Miam."
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/15/2018,$$,4,MIAM,"Wynwood overall is pretty trendy so Miam does not fail to give that cool wynwood vibe. It was easy to find parking, there wasn't a long line. My partner tried their breakfast burrito and I tried the vegan version which was the exact same thing only that his had bacon. Breakfast burrito was good but not filling. Vegan donut was good but you need to pair it with a cup a coffee, it makes it taste better. ,Try their chai tea latte iced, loved it because it's not as sweet as others I've tried. Service very friendly!"
"860 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/7/2018,$,3,Eastside Taqueria,"I was very excited for them to open up as it's right out front of my house so takes me one second to walk there! I like that they have options outside of only meat however, I wish they had a vegetarian option not only vegan. I'm fully supportive of vegans however, I'm not vegan so bring on the cheese please!!! They have a note on the menu that you cannot make any substitutions which I do abide by of course, hence this vegetarian suggestion :) ,My first order with them was a little upsetting, it was Cinco de Mayo so I knew they would be busy. I placed my order on their website and waited about 20 minutes to go get it assuming they would be behind. When I got there I found out that they never had received my order because they didn't turn on the website feature that day. Instead of quickly getting my order together because they were sorry I proceeded to wait almost another hour, I understand it was a very busy day for them but I probably won't go back just because of their lack of reaction. The food is very good and definitely recommend trying it out if you're in the area just don't trust ordering online!"
"1700 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33129",2/14/2016,$,5,Le Marché Cafe,"This place is amazing! The ambience is very laid back and the staff is so friendly, they make you feel welcomed. They have so many different options suitable for all diets: gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian and meat lovers. The coffee is awesome and they have different milk alternatives for those who prefer. The croissants are scrumptious and the soups are to die for. I would definitely recommend this place!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/7/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I ordered the gluten free Sergio for the first time today. I ordered it to go. The owners (from France) are both kind and helpful in explaining all of the options they have. My crepe was DELICIOUS, ORGANIC, and uniquely vegan. Though it was a crepe i didn't feel I sacrificed my clean eating approach. So lucky to have found this spot I will be back! Their vegan cheese is home made from veggies and so is their dressing!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/14/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,I spent a day in Miami and eating here was by far the best experience I had while I was there! The food was delicious. I had the crepe raw and I would definitely recommend it. I'm a vegan from Los Angeles so I was afraid of how limited my options would be while in Florida but this place did not disappoint. If I ever find myself in Miami again I will definitely stop by Eden in Eden again!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/10/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I am vegan and this is a wonderful place where I can eat things that have been a distant memory like quiche and crepes! Authentically french and wonderful food and service. Great for everyone, not just vegans."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/19/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"I came in here one morning and ordered one of their crepes and ordered a salad (which are huge by the way!!!). I never had a crepe before and it was really good. They give you options of having vegan cheese and it was just a bit too much for me. if you're a cheese lover, you will definitely love the crepe.,The salad was so yummy and fresh! The owner and her daughter were super polite!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/28/2018,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This is my first time in Eden In Eden. It has a pretty good menu considering that it's a veggie/vegan place. It has quite ambience and good music playing. We ordered a burger and create your own sandwich. Both of them turned out to be pretty good, although the French baguette was very hard to bite. I won't have a chance to visit this place again I would love to try crepes at this place. Definitely recommend this place."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/17/2018,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"My visit to this cute french vegan restaurant was great. I ordered a crepe with kale, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes and it came with salad and avocado. I have never had a non vegan crepe so I cannot compare. However it will filling and tasty. The service was great. I will be back try more menu items, especially the vegan croissants."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",11/28/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I've had this place bookmarked for quite awhile but I don't live near so makes it tough for me to go. Finally went yesterday and it was worth the drive. I had the vegan tuna sandwich and it was the best tuna sandwich I've ever had! I already want to go back for more. Also ordered 2 empanadas, mixed veggie and soy picadillo, they were both delicious. The place is very nice and clean, wasn't loud at all and the service was great. Will be going again soon!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/3/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Vegan and gluten-free French crepes, quiches and galettes? Yes, please. A concept that is one of a kind in Miami. We ordered delivery, so I can't speak on the restaurant itself, only the food. ,The carrot ginger soup is a skip. Too watery and no flavor. ,The vegan mushroom quiche on the other hand, was delicious. The gluten-free crust was flaky and pretty darn perfect. The cheese substitute on top resembled grated parmesan somewhat, but if you ask me, it didn't need it. The filling had tons of umami. ,What really impressed me was the gluten-free vegan apple pie. Again, it's all in the crust. Hard to believe they can make a perfect pate brisee without butter. Incredibly crispy and flaky. Topped with simple apple slices that were just soft enough but still had some bite. ,The buckwheat crepe was delicious all on its on, with just a light sprinkle of sugar. Soft, delicate, simple. Highly recommend."
"5929 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/25/2018,$,5,SUR,Amazing! As a pescatarian I'm always on the hunt for a delicious tuna sandwich. This was by far the best tuna sandwich I've ever had ... I literally figured out my yelp password JUST to post this. Super impressed by this place! I will most definitely be trying their vegan empanada next!! Cheers to these guys!
"3444 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",8/30/2017,$,5,The Bookstore and Kitchen,"I lost my E-card tonight at The Bookstore and it was amazing. Imagine introducing marshmallow fluff to a 10 year with overbearing vegan parents. That reaction =my face.,I was on campus for a work event with full intentions of going to Versailles on the way home. Waiting for the event to end, ATT said I used all,My data this month, sooooo YOLO and I opened Yelp, fat fingered my way to events and found this.,First- thank you to the CM for letting me crash. ,This was actually overwhelming initially. Walk into a room with 50 strangers, bound together by the fact we all have enough free time (and lack of face to face convos) that we post on the internet. I kid, I kid. ,This is actually a bookstore, so a huge thank you to the owner for keeping this alive. Hopefully you'll add VHS movie nights soon? ,We're given a menu for the evenings tastings, paired with white and red. Im sure the actual wine is described, but I'm not that refined, nor attempt to be. ,5 separate sharing courses:,Arugula salad with figs and fancy ham (autocorrect and I don't know how to spell prochut),Smoked Fish dip,A tomatos and herbs on bread ,Chilled shrimp sandwich ,FRENCH TOAST ,100% executed perfectly. ,I hope I'm not the only one to think this, but kudos to the new chef for planning this meal they way she did. Every dish was designed to be simple, bold flavor and texture, and fool proof. ,What I mean by fool proof is that every dish was technically meant to be served at room temp, or slightly chilled, French toast not included. The menu is designed to allow refires if needed hat won't hold the kitchen up...... a moot point considering she killed it. ,Lastly, I can finally feel vindicated in the ever lasting argument with my gf that French toast is actually a dessert  and not breakfast. ,I'm not in MIA often but very much looking forward to coming back"

I may make it a weekly thing since the vegan burger is only 6.99!!!  Oh, they also have some vegan grocery items and since they are french, my daughter loves that there are eiffel towers everywhere!  Monique will sometimes have her kids there and so it is so family friendly.  Go now!!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/22/2015,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Rare to find vegan french, everything we ordered was delicious and healthy.   The quiche vegan sausage was very good and so was quiche sergio"

The vibe is also very nice, it is owned by a small French family and they are all so sweet. ,Check them out!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/6/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,A delightful amount of love and expertise went into my Salade d'Automne...who knew that vegan turkey could be so tasty!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/10/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"This is a cute clean restaurant with light tasty food and a variety of options. I took a group here and everyone found something they liked. The Chausson appetizer (particular the one with veggie ham) is like an empanada and is quite tasty. The vegan quiche was to die for! It has a whole wheat crust so you don't feel as guilty eating it. My friend had a salad that came with quinoa and veggie ""turkey"" that she enjoyed. The carob crepe for dessert was a hit with the non vegans in the group, including the one who lived in France. The staff is very nice. I would definitely go back here again...and soon! They also have a little fridge where they sell some vegetarian products, ex: nutritional yeast, almond milk."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",11/6/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,The owner is from Paris & the food can be vegetarian or vegan.  I love the concept & I love the Crepes!  They also sell vegan products. I tried the Vegan ice cream (Dolce Peccati) & it was surprisingly delicious. They also make fresh vegetable drinks.  A great find!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/7/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,Everything about this place is perfect. The adorable family that owns it. The music. The location. The easy parking. And of course the delicious French vegan food. They have vegan crepes and quiches. Great juices. Delicious soups. Perfect salads. A must for any healthy eaters in the area!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/2/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This place is an amazing local vegan restaurant. I had the best seller, the croque monsieur and it was great. I also had the crepes with fruit and it was delicious as well. The ambiance is good for a small restaurant. It was also very inspiring to see the owner and her family running the place. I highly recommend this place. ,Follow me on IG - @mike_baptiste"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/4/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Amazing vegan health food! The service is warm and friendly, the food is mouth watering and the ambiance is quaint and homey. Do yourself a favor and try the crepe Sergio and croque monsieur. The acai bowl is also very tasty. Best acai in town! The freshest most delicious juices in the land"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/29/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This was my first time here and finding vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Miami isn't the easiest! I am vegan so I was quite excited. First I ordered the Eden Salad, I'm not a huge fan of Kale, but the way they chopped it up and mixed it with spinach made it yummy! There are also roasted veggies on a skewer on top which is seasoned and cooked perfectly. The salad dressing was yummmy!,I also ordered their soup of the day, which was lentil. Delicious. I should've taken some home it was so good ,Overall, it's a cute, clean, and small place but I definitely am coming back.,I highly recommend!"
"7235 NE 4th Ave, Miami, FL 33138",7/6/2018,$$,5,Bousa Brewing,"Bousa Brewery new food tent.  Holis Grill serves authentic Venezuelan arepas.  Made to order!  All fresh ingredients.  BBQ Ribs Arepa is mighty tasty.  They have a nice selection of homemade  sauces. I also had the vegan arepa (veggie arepa with no cheese or egg). It was stuffed full of fresh spinach, tomato, and acacado.  Everything tasted super rich and flavorful."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/3/2016,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Delicious and unique vegan options!,French pastries with fake meat? Yes, please. Eggless quiches? Oui oui! Definitely a different kind of vegetarian restaurant that deserves your attention. Portions are good (hard to find at a lot of veggie places) and everything there is vegan-friendly so you can go WILD. Highly recommended!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/8/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"What a wonderful place!!! Is very much needed to have an oasis of home made food in this area. The food is carefully made, it has love and the most important thing is that is all the food is prepared to the highest Vegan standards. ,It is all well paired together and the combinations available are phenomenal. ,The ambiance is casual, colorful and with a French flair. ,It is just wonderful to have a healthier, animal-free option in such a good location.,Highly recommended..."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/20/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Nothing short of sinfully delicious for a simple herb and cheese crepe. I highly recommend this spot for lunch, they're incredibly mindful with your time and craft insanely tasty treats that could fool non-vegans. At first impression I wondered how this spot could pull off Parisian inspired cuisine on a vegan whim and was delighted with a generously portioned melty gooey crepe with vegan cheese, leeks and herbs.,You could of fooled me into thinking it was Gouda. It wasn't insipid or lacking in texture like most vegan attempts in the area.,They also have vegan ham and turkey..a fridge with items for sale..and delivery!!,Will return again! Tres Bon!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/30/2014,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Because I'm vegan, I rarely frequent French restaurants. Eden & Eden changed that for me! I enjoyed a mushroom crepe and a chocolate dessert crepe. Both were delicious. The atmosphere is bright and airy, small but not cramped. It is a perfect place for a lunch date. The service was a bit slow, but everyone was friendly. There is ample street parking out front. I like that they sell some vegan goods on the shelves (almond milk, cereal, chia). I will definitely be back!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/16/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,The food is delicious. My favorite is the gluten free quiche. The owner/chef is awesome. I love everything about this place. Right down to her French accent. Yes. Yes. Yes. To all. Vegans and non vegans will enjoy the tasty organic French foods.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/3/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,We need to go back!!! Best vegan crepes! Monique the owner is such a beautiful soul!! We got so many things and everything was simply delicious! can wait to be back!
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/19/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Absolutely delicious!! Everything is freshly prepared. Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options. It's a must!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/1/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Very good vegan place. I am a vegetarian but often find myself looking for options to eat out other than the regular ""salad"" or pasta dish that traditional places serve. I ordered the spinach quiche and it was great! Definitely returning to try other items in the menu."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/14/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,The most delicious vegan food I've ever had. If you're vegan or thinking about becoming one this is the best place to go. Everything is fresh and top notch quality.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/18/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,I had the vegan croque monsieur. It was very flavorful. My friend and I were both impressed. The lady who runs the restaurant is from Paris and indulged my poor French. She was very nice and clearly passionate about her food which was refreshing to see. I highly recommend this restaurant.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",1/19/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I stopped in this evening after driving by a million times thinking ""I need to try that place sometime.""  Wow, am I glad I did!  I have a very long list of food allergies including: wheat, corn, milk, nuts, yeast, citrus, spinach, tomatoes & soy (to mention a few.)  The owner worked with me and I was able to enjoy a gluten free crepe with vegetarian cheese & onions - it was awesome. With it I had the small Parisienne salad without the vegan chicken. And last, but not least, an apple pie.  Something I haven't had in years.,I will be a frequent customer from now on!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/23/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"We were originally going to a spot next door, but changed our mind when we saw this place. Vegetarian and vegan food? Yes! My boyfriend and I both ordered the Croque monsieur. Delicious!!!!!! I can't wait to come back :)"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/5/2014,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"I was excited to come this place since I am vegetarian, but I am not mainly because of the price and the service. When you walk into a new place that has opened and you are the only ones in there, usually the staff might greet with you a warm welcome and questions like is this your first time, would you like some recommendations, something. The guys barely got a hello out and then I asked him for his favorite thing on the menu and he said the CREPES CHAMPIGNONS which I got. My hubby settled for the QUICHE VEGAN with spinach.,The food came out pretty quickly and was served a sauce that we dipped our food in. The crepe was ok, nothing spectacular and I wouldn't call it the best thing on the menu. My husband's quiche was pretty good and I would come back for it. The only problem I have with the place is the lack of excitement from the staff and the prices. On their website the prices are $8.50, but we were charged $13 for each item which I don't think the ambiance and the food is worth that."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/17/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,A vegan or vegetarians paradise. I had the taboulet salad which was very generous in portion size and delicious. The vegetarian white ham in the salad was so tasty and really tasted like ham. So large I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Really recommend this place.
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/30/2014,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"My fiancée and I were very impressed with the food options and great service at this quaint little cafe. I give them kudos for being innovative and bringing up this new concept..French/Vegan cuisine. It was refreshing to step into a vegan place that offered more than just salads and wraps. We had the vegan sausage quiche, ginger/carrot soup and a smoothie. They all were all delicious. I also liked the fact that the portions were fairly big (compared to most vegan places) and the quiche was warm, hearty and filling so it definitely hit the spot for me. I'm sometimes left feeling a little hungry after eating at some vegan spots, but not the case this time!,The place was clean and had a very positive vibe to it. You can tell they put a lot of effort into opening and managing it. It's a family operated restaurant so it seems like it's been a labor of love for the owners which is always great to see. It's located in the silver bluff neighborhood, which is up an coming with great new restaurants and things to do everywhere. Overall...it was a great experience and we will definitely be going back. Great food, interesting vegan options and quality service = FIVE STARS!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/20/2015,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"I love this place!  The food is delicious. Staff is kind and helpful. Crepe Sergio is my favorite. Very interesting concept, French Vegan. It is a little pricey for a juice spot but the fresh ingredients and quality is worth it. They also deliver, which is a great."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/9/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"At first I was a but hesitant since some things stated raw in the menu, I was thinking this would be the super healthy veg place. After eating I was surprised by how delicious and flavorful all the food was. We tried the vegan sausage quiche, made our own tofu sandwich, and tried the eden burger. All where delish and their sausage isn't like other vegan places that use Seiten and taste like cardboard with sauce. This was amazing and flavorful with its own flavor. We also tried two smoothies which were heavenly and not too sweet. I would come here again, if I lived here I'd stop by a couple times a week."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",5/10/2016,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"French Vegan CAFE. That's pretty unique, if you asked me. No froufrou restaurant here, but a casual place that does what seems to be primarily crepes (although they have other things going on in the menu too).,And as far as vegan crepes go, it was pretty good. And it was also surprisingly large (but it should have been, if the one I ordered was $12.50 anyways). But I'm not sure if I would go back to order it again - partly because I love well-made non-vegan crepes too much. These were made without eggs and dairy.,And would I come back for the quiches? Well... again, these have no eggs and dairy. And with so many quiches being available around town... yeah, I wouldn't... but it's not you. It's me. I'm sure they're great for those who have forsaken the cluck-cluck of the chickens. But I'm sure I'd be willing to take a bite of my vegan friend's order, if we do end up here again.,I had the CREPE SERGIO which comes with kale, mushrooms, spinach, dried tomatoes, and avocado. All healthy, and pretty tasty. And it's a good option for vegetarians/vegans in case if they're looking for something different."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",7/5/2017,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"Great idea but just wasn't blown away and found the service to be poor and the prices to be unreasonable. They had a vast selection of vegan options which I thought was great, but if I can summarize the dishes using one word it'd be ""meh"". The flavor just wasn't there. My partner and I ordered the raw crepe and the croque sandwich. You do get decent portions but you're paying over $10 for a crepe so I would hope it was a decent size. Overall, it was a decent stop and glad to see Miami has vegan establishments but it just didn't hit the spot."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",3/5/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Hole in the wall , literally due to the size and location.the food is interesting , lots of options and all vegan or vegetarian .super tasty with aFrench influence .it is a little pricey so beware and lastly it does take forever so don't go when in a rush or press for time .instead bring a book and come enjoy some fresh ingredients and colorful good meal and one of the most hospitable service ever .ps:parking isn't easy"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/23/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"This is probably the healthiest place to eat in Miami, if your looking for raw vegan food and raw vegan treats this is it They also have some yummy vegan cooked items like vegan empanadas, soups, and even crepes! its a french place so cute :D"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/12/2016,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Vegan food can't get any easier than this! I ordered delivery via Yelp, while also getting an eye for what others had posted pics of and reccomended. I ordered the cleaning smoothie ($8.95) and the crepe champignons ($10.80), then was charged $4.00 delivery fee. I don't think that's too expensive, especially compared to other restaurants with delivery in the area. The food arrived within 45 minutes, and the delivery guy actually made the effort to come up to my door (which is rare at my complex). The cleaning smoothie is pretty much the greenest smoothie you can get, because of the kale. But it's not bitter, you can still taste the fruit (banana, pear and pineapple) in it. It was a great tasting smoothie (and I am hoping healthy!), but I wish there was more ice put into the blender. It was less like a smoothie and more like a thicker juice - think of milkshake consistency. The crepe champignons was so good, you can't even tell the cheese is vegan cheese. It tastes just like parmesean. It has a great blend of ingredients and was a really large portion, I couldn't finish my entire meal so I had leftovers. I am excited to order from here again and try different options!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/12/2017,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"Definitely the best smoothies in the area. The food is excellent, and very healthy. AmaZing place if your a vegan or health nut, but great for anyone as well. The owners are very nice French people. A hidden gem on coral way!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/8/2016,$$,5,Eden In Eden,"The place is kind of magical place with music from fairy tales, We tried  5 different vegan restaurant in Miami, this one offers something different, with French atmosphere style every dishes becomes dream, maybe because of the extraordinary service, or the wonderful chef but when you hungry you will be pleased  after eating.,First We took the Carrot-Ginger soup that was o.k but not enough salty so added ""herbamare"" that was on the table and then it was great.,For the main we took special scrambled Tofu with onions and mushrooms and it was delicious. ,We also took the quiche that was very nice and soft and warm with European Salad (for the health..) was very fresh.,Lastly we ordered the ,Bottom line:,The place is cozy small and warm and really inviting you like family.,The service is warm and wonderful and you can ask for anything they will be happy to make you. ,And lastly it offers something little different for vegans.,Go visit!"
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/11/2015,$$,3,Eden In Eden,"I set the standard pretty tall for vegan restaurants mainly because I visit so many of them in different cities. I'm also vegan myself and a decent cook, so by no means is my review to be interpreted as a negative one...just a snobby one. ,The restaurant serves mostly salads, juices, and sandwiches. I was in the mood for cooked food and found a mushroom quiche on the menu. It was very flavorful, but unfortunately not filling ($10 for a slice with a few leaves of salad). Perhaps that is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to vegan restaurants: small portions paired with high prices for meals that are not terribly complex. ,I would recommend coming here for a light lunch or appetizer or perhaps to try one of their many juice combos. The staff is amicable and eager to help you pick out a menu item."
"1248 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",2/12/2017,$$,4,Eden In Eden,"Extensive vegan menu, courteous service and my husband says the best fresh orange juice he ever tasted. Clean and peaceful atmosphere."
"150 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/11/2017,$$,5,The Local Craft Food & Drink,"I was incredibly surprised by the service here on a Saturday morning. We were a party of 10 hungover wedding goers from the night before that strolled in unannounced to this tiny gem. It was anyone's nightmare. To my surprise, we were greeted with a warm smile and they seated us right away. The highlight of the day was when the chef approached our table after one of our friends needed a vegan dish. He made sure to add all of the acceptable ingredients and whipped a magical salad for him. Funny enough, even the meat eaters were jealous of such a delicious and aesthetically pleasing dish. They won my heart immediately."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",8/9/2015,$$$,4,Texas de Brazil,"For all the meat-lovers out there, Texas de Brazil is everything you could want. I went to the Dadeland Mall location this past Friday for lunch and everyone in my party loved it, except my one vegan co-worker. The meal starts with a trip to the buffet which in addition to the usual salad bar items has a delicious lobster bisque, cheesy gratin potatoes, and a wide selection of cured meats. But the real fun starts when you sit back down at your table and flip your card to green. The staff comes around with a large variety of different meats for you to choose from. I cannot remember everything I had but I was a big fan of the flank steak, chicken breast in bacon, and the pork loin. Waiters continue to circle your table with different meats until every card is turned back to red and no one can eat another bite, if you can even move. For lunch it is only $27, which is honestly a great value. The only real issue is that you will find that your productivity will come to an end as you can hardly move let alone think when you return to work. I know I will be back."
"12560 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",7/30/2016,$,3,Jamrock Cuisine,Let me just say this review is a bit skewed because I do not eat meat. They only have 2 plates curry tofu & jerk tofu and no veggie patties available that day. I tried the jerk tofu chop. The rice and peas & salad were good but the tofu had no texture. I have eaten tofu prepared all kind of ways but this was just the block of tofu straight out the package. Maybe if I ate all the other plates with meat my rate would be higher. If you are vegan/vegetarian this is not your place.
"49 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",7/20/2012,$$,5,SuViche Brickell,Excellent Vegan roll with macadamia nuts.
"49 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",4/29/2018,$$,5,SuViche Brickell,Great spot! Super fresh and vegan friendly. The veggie sushi roll is the best in the area! I am also in love with the toasted corn they bring for the table. Outside seating is beat as this is a very small space.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/9/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I discovered this restaurant while I was looking for some quick and casual vegan options in Miami.

Great atmosphere! AWESOME food and drink! Meat if you like or VEGAN if you choose. Service with a personal touch. Definitely going back."

A wide variety of empanadas, pizzas, (even vegan options available) tacos and not to forget the guacamole which was out of this world!!! I will be back very soon!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/30/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"the vegan, gluten free pizzas tasted like the freezer that had been in :-(  nothing especially fresh or healthy."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2016,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Very nice place, cozy feeling and great taste. Artisanal baked empanadas, Argentinean flavour! Also a wide variety of pizzas, also Gluten-free pizzas, vegan meatballs and more."

The empanadas and pizzas are too die for. Can't wait to try more things on the menu  literally eating the new vegan empanada as you read this. I'm drooling hahaha
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/28/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,So many delicious vegan options! Even my non-vegans ate them instead. Staff is very informative and nice! A must when I'm in South Florida. My friend ended leaving with a half dozen frozen empanadas.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,I love this place. I've only been twice. But each time the food is so so good. The vegan chorizo pizza and the vegan empanadas are beyond. The owner is so cute and the spot itself feels warm & cozy. A must try and repeat!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,My son and I ate vegan today. We had berry guacamole and pizza. My son is helping me embrace this vegan lifestyle. He hasn't said no trying anything yet and he actually asked to come back to this restaraunt. Great job

We took the owner's recommendations and had their signature empanadas that are made in a wood burning oven. To die for!! We had a delicious coconut butternutsquash soup. We also had blackened grilled fish tacos that were bomb. They have an amazing vegan & vegetarian selection. The owner Fufi is super passionate about everything in her restaurant and it showed. This is definitely our new spot in Miami. 5 star!!"

"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"FUFI is a hip, fresh and affordable restaurant. Their happy hour (Monday- Friday from 4pm-7pm) is the most amazing deal I have yet to receive in Miami. You receive two homemade baked (not fried!) empanadas and one drink of your choice for 7$ total. I ordered a special eggplant curry empanada and a spinach mozzarella empanada. Both were delicious. The sangria I ordered was not to my liking, but it was a very generous drink portion, and came with an edible flower! I also split the vegan pizza and substituted mozzarella for the vegan cheese. My friend who shared it with me is huge meat eater, and even he loved it. The service at Fufi was great, and we received our food with a reasonable wait time. The restaurant isn't close to my neighborhood, but I definitely plan to be back, likely for happy hour"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/4/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Love their empanadas and this small little neighborhood joint in Buena vista. Fufi is always here and very welcoming. My favorite is the ""beef"" garden. How can something vegan be so good! To die for!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,Yummy Vegan food in Wynwood area.  It's a small place but there is outside seating.  Service and price is great.   I would highly recommend and will be returning.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/5/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"*vegans/vegetarians/folks with food sensitivities double check your food* ,Y'all. I was soooo excited to try this restaurant. Argentine-style empanadas? Yay! Vegan options? Omg! They completely had me before I stepped foot in the restaurant. I even made the drive down all the way from Ft Lauderdale. ,When I first arrived, the bartender/server was quite kind and very attentive. I placed my order for 2 vegan empanadas, a glass of their Argentine rosé and their soup of the day (potato leek). ,I was promptly served my rosé and it was delish. I couldn't wait to try my food! ,This is where things took a turn for the worst. Folks started to trickle in after me but their food came out before mine. I'm thinking, no biggie. Maybe the vegan empanadas take longer to bake? ,30 minutes go by and I haven't even gotten my soup. I'm a super patient person but at this point I'm a bit concerned. 45 minutes have now gone by and not even a mention of where my food is. My server has not acknowledged how long it's taken and everyone around me is enjoying their soups, appetizers, deserts and empanadas. What happened to my kind, attentive server?,At this point, I'm just hungry :( ,Finally my food comes out all at once. I'm almost finished with my wine. I would have normally ordered another glass but I'm a bit over it at this point. ,I try the soup and it could use a bit more flavor but it'll do. I try one of my empanadas, the vegan chorizo and it was okay. Again, it was missing a bit of something but it will do. ,I then bite into my second empanada and I don't even recognize what I'm eating. ""Oh, this is cheese"" I think to myself. ,*sigh* I'm super sensitive to dairy. ,I call my server over who is confused as to how this could happen. She assures me that she put in the right order (I completely believe her) and that there was a mixup with the kitchen. ,She kindly did not charge me for my empanada and gave me a discount on the wine. ,There seems to be other diners who have had this problem so I think this is something that Fufi should look into just a bit more. ,This place has the potential to be phenomenal but I just can't give it more than 3 stars after such a long wait for food I couldn't even eat. ,+1 for the private parking behind the restaurant."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/29/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Ordered two vegan pizzas for my birthday, they sounded really good and looked even better when they arrived. Only problem is that BOTH pies weren't cut, at all. We literally had to use my plastic cake knife and a butter knife to cut the pies. Wish they tasted better for all the hard work we put into cutting them!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Where do I start?! This place is amazing. I've been coming here for two years and I have only seen great growth. The hospitality and atmosphere is just warm and inviting. Florencia's empanadas are delicious and huge in variety, i am vegan and she has so many vegan options. You can't go wrong with anything it's all so delicious and nourishing. They even have a vegan apple empanada coconut milk ice cream dessert. I mean you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have a great happy hour 4-7 pm two empanadas and a drink. Mexican pizza is delicious. Just try it for yourself you'll love it!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/3/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Nicely welcomed our party of 8 without a reservation. Fufi was amazingly nice and explain the menu and history of the business. I got the lunch special of salad, soup, and chicken and beef empanadas. I loved the salad dressing and the lentil soup, but the empanadas were amazing! They have vegan, vegetarian, and meat options. The dough was crispy and the filling tasted great. Highly recommend!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"We came right as they opened on a Monday, so the place was very clean and the one employee that was working the front of house was extremely polite. We ordered one of each of the vegan empanadas, along with the vegan Mexican pizza. It took almost an hour to receive our food, there were also people waiting pretty long at the bar to pick up to-go orders. The mexican pizza was delicious, my only ""complaint"" would be the vegan cheese they use doesn't melt so it was falling off and quite messy to eat. The garden and beef garden empanadas were the best, so flavorful and piping hot. The curry empanada wasn't bad, just a bit bland. We used a bit of their hot sauce on everything though, which were so spicy and tasty, but even they didn't redeem the curry flavor. Our chorizo empanada came out last, yet it was a bit cold inside. The flavor was also blah, like a can of tomatoey beans inside dough, but my boyfriend actually liked it. But the crust itself on all the empanadas was spot on, perfectly crispy and delicious. They are also small, but not too pricey. I wish we got to try the apple pie dessert, but we were scared it would add another half hour to our stay. Overall, it was a cute small restaurant with lots of vegan options and great service, we will go again on our next trip to Miami."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/5/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I took my son's aunt there for her birthday - specifically for their vegan options. We were welcomed warmly by the owner and she really went above and beyond making my sister in law feel special on her birthday. Created  a special vegan birthday creation empanada just for her. ,We ordered the steak, bacon/Brie/date, and curried eggplant empanadas and they were all fantastic. We also got the Gaia vegan pizza which was just as delicious and berry guacamole. Chicken tacos were ordered for my son - and although he gobbled them up, I honestly would have just ordered the chicken empanadas instead since it's the same filling.,It was a great experience with options for both vegans and meat eaters to enjoy, and the owner was a joy to chat with."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/27/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Gotta hand it to Fufi. In this culinary wasteland called Miami, they're really trying to do their best for us vegans.,The empanadas here really hit the spot. Just don't catch them on a sloppy day or they'll be cold on the inside. Hit or miss I'd say. The waitresses also tend to confuse what's vegan and what isn't.,I've tried some other stuff on the menu and just like most other vegan options in Miami, it's a sad substitute that ""gets the job done"" for most people. But it's still expensive and bland.,Good enough."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I stopped by Fufi because I heard they had vegan options on their menu. That's an understatement - they have so many options for every craving and I was shocked at how many off menu items they had when I mentioned I was vegan. The service here may actually be the best experience I've had in Miami and the owners are so welcoming you'll feel like family.  List of absolute must try items:,Mushroom empanadas - mixture of three different types of mushrooms with garlic and onions (vegan),Vegan beef empanadas - vegan beef crumbles, peppers and onions with a special chipotle sauce on the side,Gaia vegan pizza - vegan mozzarella, roasted eggplant, onions, peppers, arugula and balsamic drizzle,Vegan apple empanadas with a side of vegan vanilla ice cream - don't be alarmed if a tear falls from your eye when you taste it"
"11865 SW 26th St, Miami, FL 33175",4/7/2016,$$,5,Sushi 2 Mee,This place is awesome. They listen to what you order and will literally deliver almost anywhere. Finally a place that doesn't compromise their quality of food and service. Plus I'm vegan and I can eat happily
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,The restaurant is very hippy like and very casual. I think it's a little to pricey for the type of food. I didn't like my vegan pizza meanly because it was way to greasy for my liking and it didn't have a lot of flavor. I wouldn't go back there. The service was nice
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Oh my oh my oh my the Vegan options abound at this amazing eatery! Let's start with the  delicious Malbec pairing with the berry guacamole which is so unique and delightful!! Guac with pomegranate and dried cranberries...sooo much more amazing than you would think!! We ordered ALL of the vegan empanadas and the faves were the Chorizo and the Beef Garden but my god all were fabulous!! ,Service is amazing. She is letting us just chill through this crazy thunderstorm. P.s. parking is in back off 46th Street!!! Come and try you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Vegan empanadas are great, just be sure to double check that they give you the vegan version!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/9/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"I was looking for a healthyish dish after one of my occasional gym jaunts, and was drawn to Fufi - I'm going to sound like our orange hued leader - but by a cute girl who was noshing outside as I drove by. I did chat with her, found she was not an employee and even (gasp) vegan. But you guys should definitely hire her for marketing =),As noted, they have outside seating and I learned they are dog friendly, so Princess Luna will make a visit sometime.,But anyway, back to my dinner. Fufi's has a menu with broad appeal to both vegans and omnivores. Trying to balance both worlds, I ordered their taco salad (with added chicken of course). You know I like my food seasoned and customized, and I wasn't disadppointed. For one, they took out the avocado (not allergic, just OCD against it). The cilantro dressing was rich and tasty without being overwhelming,  and there was plenty of cheese and tomatoes.,Me being me, despite the gym, ordered their apple pie (though I customized out the ice cream). This deliciousness has a thin crust, plenty of apples and nuts- see, fruits - and a light cinnamon taste. It's definitely a good close to my meal."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/1/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Fufi's is great for everyone. They have meat options as well as plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. If you decide to eat here I suggest the empanadas. That's what they are known for and they are excellent! (I ordered the pizza once, it wasn't bad but like I said stick to the empanadas). ,Fufi's is a small and adorable cafe located in Buena vista right next to Lemoni cafe. The owner is Argentinean and prides herself in making great empanadas. All of the vegan empanadas are delicious and she will test different flavors adding new ones to the menu which always keeps things infesting. My favorite is the garden meat (she uses the ground meat from Atlas) and the chorizo and bean. Other flavors include, eggplant curry, creamy corn, mushroom and goat cheese and many more. ,In addition to empanadas, she also serves tacos, pizza and apps. Their soup of the day is always vegetarian friendly and each time more delicious than the last. ,I recommend ordering a cup of the daily soup, a few empanadas and an Argentinean wine. Then sit back and enjoy yourself. ,P.s I took one star off only because almost every time my empanada order gets mixed up. Although they do fix my order, it's happened several times.,But I come back anyway !,Tips:,Yelp check in offer- one free empanada ,happy hour special. 2 empanadas and a drink for 7$. ,Outdoor seating available,Dog friendly"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/6/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"This is a great little hidden spot! The service was friendly and they made my friend and I feel really welcome. The decor was very quaint with a lot of beautiful plant life around the restaurant. It isn't very big but it is very comfortable and feels a bit more intimate that way. It is a bit pricey but quite worth it for the quality ingredients. The restaurant is also vegan and gluten free friendly, with clear markings on the menu listings.  ,Their empanadas are definitely what first attracted me to try them but other selections, such as tacos and pizza, are also great choices. ,The caramelized onion, mushroom and goat cheese empanada was listed as a ""people's favorite"", and I can see why! The flavors blended together perfectly. The eggplant curry empanada was also very rich in spices and flavor. We also enjoyed the berry guacamole; it was a combination I had never thought to try but the flavor contrast worked so so well together! A great start to our meal already. ,For my entrée I had the fungi pizza, containing mozzarella, truffle oil and several types of mushroom. It felt very sophisticated compared to your typical pie. It was not too oily and the mushrooms were cooked so they were flavorful and soft. Every option for pizza was very unique and I love the different spin they put on this area of their dishes. It turns an option that can easily be one dimensional and boring into something exciting with depth. ,For dessert I had the homemade tiramisu. It was creamy and delicious, while still not being too heavy. Cutting into it with the spoon was so easy and oh so satisfying. We were also pleasantly surprised with a sparkler and candle for our little birthday celebration! ,It was all very sweet and I definitely hope to return soon!! Quality ingredients and a great environment. Fufi easily earns 5 stars from me."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/19/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Mushrooms, caramelized onions and goat cheese is my favorite empanada! Pizzas are delicious and vegans have many options to try.,Great atmosphere, inside and outside, although a bit noisy."
"5335 NW 87th Ave, Doral, FL 33178",5/11/2018,$$,5,Bulla Gastrobar,"Wow! What an amazing happy hour!! The white wine sangria is amazing!  Only it isn't white wine, it's like a prosecco? Idk, it's delicious.  Equally fantastic is the beer sangria.  I must be a sangria girl because I was living for these drinks. The tapas were so yummy, too. DO get the patatas bravas.  Another hearty and tasty tapa was the ""Huevos Bulla"" - that was ""slap yo momma"" good.  The tostada de aguacate is delicious and vegan!  I wish I would've taken pics of the food but we were busy going in!! Our waitress was attentive and checked on us often!  The manager, Shelly, is the bomb!  She checked on us, made recommendations, was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, (duh, she's the manager), and was funny!  Honestly I haven't had a good night out like this in a while. I read other posts saying the place is expensive. Honestly, I felt like I got what I paid for and maybe even more.  The atmosphere, food, and service was on point! I look forward to visiting Bulla again."
"9005 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",10/8/2017,$,5,Lime Fresh Mexican Grill,"I love this place! I was a little worried they wouldn't have any vegan options but they can make anything vegetarian and with a few changes and some guacamole to the mix I had hands down the best bean burrito. Their variety of hot sauces was so amazing I couldn't pick just one. Don't even get me started on the bean and corn salsa! I wanted to take the whole container home. It's a big college student hotspot and a great after school, work, life hangout! With Great food and great hospitality this is my go too Mexican food destination!"
"11740 SW 104th St, Miami, FL 33186",4/5/2017,$$,4,Killian Cafe & Grill,"I have visited a few times for breakfast only and haven't been disappointed yet. I usually get the Portobello crepe which comes with feta cheese and spinach and a side salad(I know its weird for breakfast but I don't like eggs, bacon etc...) This is very tasty and filling as well. I also had their cinnamon & sugar crepe that was very good too. I would of given 5 stars if they had more options for vegetarians/vegan. All in all it is a very good restaurant."
"11740 SW 104th St, Miami, FL 33186",4/22/2018,$$,4,Killian Cafe & Grill,"So out for Sunday brunch on our new motorcycle I like to try new places to eat . I saw Killian Café had good reviews and thought to try it . We arrived and there was a little bit of a waiting line . Which I always think that is a good thing  . We were called to our outside table ,which was nice .  I am vegan and knew that I have to special order my food , which I did but unfortunately the waitress misunderstood and ordered my food with mozzarella. I explained again I am vegan and didn't want any cheese on my food . She proceed to blame me for her not understanding my order. I told her just give me sautéed veggies . She came back with only mushrooms with spinach . I looked at it and thought well she is not getting a tip.  Then I ordered a side of toast to eat with it . A gentleman ( which I mistook for the chef ) had come out early to offer coffee and see if things were good . He Had come out again  to see what happen . I explained and he offered to remake it . He was extreme nice , I decline as I was getting full from my mushroom and toast and asked if he was the chef . He explain he was the owner and apologies for the misunderstanding . He also took off the mushroom from the bill , Because of his nice hospitality and attentiveness. I give this restursnt 4 stars And tip her after all . Plus My wife's food came out fast and was good and filling. We will come back again for a 2nd try :)"
"709 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/4/2017,$$,5,The Anderson,"Totally recommend this bar! Awesome vibe with music at perfect volume so great for a first date or group gatherings. I can tell it's a popular place judging by how crowded it was by 11 on the Saturday that I went. Delicious cocktails that change every three months. Food was also a hit. I'm vegan so they made an awesome vegan wrap for me that I can't wait to order again. There's street parking but also for convenience, valet for only $5."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/3/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Groupon introduced us to this great experience of a dine. It was a little difficult to find at first but once we did, we were amazed how crowded the small area was that housed the food truck. All of the items on the menu were vegan. We ordered the Rachael on Rye, the Island Patty Melt and an order of the loaded fries. All were thoroughly enjoyed! We will definitely be coming back!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/6/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Great vegan food, great set up! Try their burgers and their fries are amazing! Expect to pay over $10 if you want more than a burger. They are friendly as well. The only downfall is the parking...but Im not knocking a star for that! Either you find free parking around or you pay for parking on 79th street. I highly recommend it."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/14/2016,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Delicious ! Delicious!  I had the nachos and the "" le bleu""   Sandwich and I was in vegan heaven! Highly recommend"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/22/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is awesome!! I heard about Atlas from a vendor at the Yellow Green Market (also amazing). Shortly after I saw a Groupon and immediately purchased it. I brought my carnivorous husband who usually hates vegan food and we both loved our homestyle vegan sandwiches. I got the buttermilk chicken which was the best vegan chicken I have ever had with waffle fries, ""cheese"" sauce, and a root beer. My husband got the tips  sandwich, which I tried but honestly tasted too much like meat to me and freaked me out, so there really is something for every type of vegan here. Vegans who don't like meat and want something delicious, and vegans who miss the taste of meat. The setting was adorable and the vegan community around was wonderful, it was great to talk to other people with a similar frame of mind when it comes to diet. The guy who took our order was wonderful, super friendly, best customer service I've ever had in Miami. This was such a treat. There are other vegan places I'm honestly not crazy about and this was just a great experience with amazing food."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/5/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,ordered the Kansas city burnt tips which were so finger licking good with loaded fries that made me do the happy dance. I also ordered the wood bone wings which wasn't for me. 2 minutes away from my house so definitely will be trying out more. Way better than other vegan options in the area.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/18/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Hands down best vegan burgers and food EVER. Forget the overrated, overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. Atlas has the most flavorful foods, it all tastes different. Best part? GREAT, if not perfect customer service, it's usually quite busy, but you barely have to wait for your food."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/19/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,SOOOOOOOO GOOD. Staff is friendly and the food is ridiculous. If there was more vegan food like this everyone would be down.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/27/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I ended up trying this place since I've been to a few local restaurants offering their products. I love how chill and relaxed the food truck is, it's very reminiscent of the Wynwood Yard! Plenty of parking in adjacent streets. I got the burger, which was okay! But my goodness are those loaded fries delicious!!! It's definitely vegan junk food at it's best."

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/15/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,I was in town for vacation and wanted raw options. Saw this place on HappyCow and booked a reservation simply because I saw they had raw options. I hadn't looked at the menu or even looked up the restaurant. Boy was I BLOWN AWAY! This was the best raw vegan dining experience I will probably ever have. The staff here is exquisite and elegant. The food is portioned very nicely and has such beautiful presentation. Most of the food is sourced locally and is organic. No gluten in house which is amazing! Also the atmosphere of this place is absolutely incredible. I've never been at such a beautiful restaurant. I had such a beautiful experience here and I am so happy I came.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/19/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Simply....outstanding. The setting is a beautiful zen environment surrounded by water, plants and trees while in the middle of Wynwood. The food is absolutely incredible, vegan or not. I had the celery root lasagne and my husband had the tamale. I honestly don't know which one I liked better! I wanted more of each. The drinks were delicious as well and great service by everyone there. It's not cheap but it's definitely worth every penny!"
"9251 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",4/18/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"This place is so amazing ! Free almost unlimited parking, and an outdoor seating area if you don't want to watch TV or hear the music. We were greeted right when we came in, the guy (I wish I got his name he is so attentive somebody give that boy a raise/promotion ! He was skinny and a little tall) I had never been here but have heard many great things and my boyfriend tried it last week and has gone back three times this week so I just had to try it. I'm vegan and he's not so I was a little skeptical if I was gonna find anything for me. I ordered their veggie burger minus the Cheese and pincho sauce. The veggie burger was amazing the only thing, it's not a burger. It's just mashed black beans with a couple other ingredients and it's just missing a little more seasoning. But I can't use this against them because they aren't a place who specifically caters vegans so im grateful to just have that option. Also the fricken sweet potato tater tots !! Oh my geez, why didn't I know what apple butter was before ? Who thought of this ? Whoever did I love you forever ! The flavors were so good and even though I'm vegan I can pin point good meat and my boyfriends steak pincho looked so JUICY. He also orders shrimp pinchos which looked perfectly cooked. Golden on the outsides and pink on the inside. I really love this place and the way the young man treated us ! This automatically became one of my go-to places in the area"

Don't even get me started about the cocktails. The barlotto was delicious, and they even custom made my order to be vegan as I told my server about my special diet. So happy I visited, definitely going back soon!"
"8405 Mills Dr, Kendall, FL 33183",3/29/2018,$$,3,Pisco Y Nazca,"The best thing on the menu is the grilled octopus and rocoto ceviche. The cocktails and beer selection are nothing to write home about. Not a bad vibe but feels pretty lounge/generic. Could be better but could also be worse. Also, very little in the way of vegetarian/vegan options."

I am so impressed with this place, that I am writing the review from the table... ,Honestly, the menu did not sound appealing to me, but still decided to give it a shot, and I am very glad I did. While the food was not ""out of this world"", it was VERY VERY good... and the ambiance and the service made it an overall experience of 10/10... ,Definitely recommend it... at first I though I shouldn't believe the 17 - 5 star reviews... but again... here I am... gladly leaving the #18..."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/12/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Fantastic, life altering, eye opening EXPERIENCE of a restaurant. You do NOT have to be Vegan to thoroughly ENJOY dining here. The passion fruit flan is REMARKABLE and we didn't recognize it was plant based until half way through and were truly mind blown because flan is literally made from milk!!!! The cauliflower is delicious, the mushroom ""ropa vieja"" WOW. My least favorite part, if I'm honest, is the watermelon drink. It tastes really fresh and refreshing, but WAY too sweet! So if you're not into sweet sweet drinks, try their mojito..... it's the bomb lol they offered us a tour after dining and it was incredible!!!!!! Check out the photos of this kitchenless eatery:"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/14/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,A completely off the hook Vegan Mecca Of place. The amazing food is worth walking from Alaska to eat. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/18/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"We are not vegans or vegetarians.  But we love Mobi's restaurant Little Pine in Los Angeles and decided to try this vegan hot spot in Miami.  Yum on all we had but the cheese board.  Not disappointed otherwise.  We had harvest dumplings, beet tostada, funghi noodles and banana leaf tamale.  Our two desserts were the baby apples with chocolate bark and the sweet potato pie.  The apple dessert was a huge omg.  An absolute must.  Smaller menu and more pricey than Little Pine.  Also, a bit less creative.  But for Miami, is great spot.  And unlike Little Pine where food is cooked, this place is raw.  More intimate and zen.  Outdoor seating definitely preferred here.  Zen garden with water and trees.  Very relaxing. An international crowd.  Wine list very good, considering all are organic.  Highly recommend.  Hear that chef owner is in litigation with landlord, so not sure if will be here longer.   But while it is, you should go."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/16/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"The presentation, flavors, and service make this place amazing. We came for a late night bite, and they didn't slack on anything. It was many of our first times having vegan food, and we were impressed with it all. Enjoyed the ambience as well. Would def go back, and I'm not even vegan."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/20/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"If you have not been to Plant Miami, you need to go now!!! OK so why go to a Vegan restaurant if your not Vegan? Ha! This place will convince you, you just might tolerate being Vegan. The food is delicious and the ambiance is spectacular. We visited on a Tuesday night and the stars where out and the view of the lit up buildings through the trees, sitting next  to the fountain  was magical. We had the castelvetrano olives to start which were delicious and the Beet Tostadas. For dinner we had the celery root lazagna. I don't like celery and I left nothing on my plate! We topped it off with the sweet potatoes pie and we were fighting for the spoon. All in all it was a great experience."

Please open a location in Boston!!"

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/17/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Great food in an excellent setting that both vegans and non vegans can enjoy. I started with the dumpling and the tamale (brunch menu). Both dishes were very good although very small portions. We then had the funghi and the kofte. The funghi was amazing and full of flavor which isn't easy to pull off with a raw cold dish. The kofte was also very good but outshined by the funghi. We then finished off with the papaya cheesecake , which was good, but not excellent and extremely overpriced for the portion. All in all, the food was great."

The portions looked small....no tiny!  Tiny food.  My daughter-in-law and I had the Moroccan bowl, one son had the Banana Leaf Tamale and the other son had  the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja.  I tasted all of them.  All were perfectly spiced and so delicious.  My favorite might have been the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja, and the Banana Leaf Tamale is a close second.  I have to talk about the cheese platter we had to start.  The cheeses were more of a pate texture (was a surprise to me, the non vegan) so good and delicious, also the compote but the pickles were a bit strong for me.   We all cleaned our plates and was surprisingly FULL!  WE still had the tiny dessert key lime brulee with the vanilla ice cream because.......we just had too!  Whoo!  They did not disappoint.  Oh my son said the 'Old Fashioned' he ordered was the best he ever had.,Now for the long drive back to Boca Raton, and I thought for sure I will need a little sumtin sumtin to eat when I got home....guess what, I was still satisfied and relishing in what I had just experienced.  This is absolutely the best vegan gastronomic experience I have ever had. Go and enjoy."

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Absolutely hands down a great place. The whole menu is vegan or plant-based and gluten free. From the freshness and great selection of their ingredients to the elegant yet chic presentation of their dishes and drinks this place sets the atmosphere for everyone to relish great healthy dining in a sacred hidden Miami Paradise-like location. Dishes like the harvest dumplings, beet tostada or the handmade cheese board will have your taste buds asking for more . Not to mention their great succulent fusion of flavors covering a wide variety of international dishes like tamales, cacio de funghi, celery root lasagna, sprouted almond falafel or the asian Bowl just to mention a few. ,This is a must try new experience for all vegan and non-vegans to see what is like to dine in a place that doesn't use any animal products in their recipes and serves in decent moderate portions defying the American conception of huge or supersize portions where one stuffs oneself beyond our limits"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/22/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,I'm a carnivore but my best friend is vegan and we had dinner here. Food was surprisingly amazing. I had the banana leaf tamale and it tasted like meat tamale. It was delicious and to know that there wasn't any meat was amazing.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/31/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"If you are a vegan and you enjoy experimenting with gourmet cuisine, go to Plant Miami. The ambiance is beyond exquisite, the service is perfect and the food is delicious.  It is on the expensive side however, it is worth it."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/13/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I was only in Miami for two and a half days and I came to Plant twice. The restaurant is beautiful and secluded making it feel like you are on a Zen retreat. Every single thing that came out was out if this world, order the cheese board and you won't be disappointed. The sweet potato cheesecake was one of the best desserts I've had and it was raw vegan. I think the menu is priced fairly for food that is so obviously cooked with love and exquisite attention to detail. The servers make you feel relaxed and the food comes out at a perfect pace."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/14/2018,$$$,3,Plant Miami,"The ownership changed but the head chef stayed. I love raw vegan food and loved a few specific dishes at this place. Unfortunately they changed the recipes and missed! The grounds are as beautiful as ever, the service very good and the servers knowledgeable about every dish. I hope they get it right soon as we don't have many choices for this sort of food around here. We stopped for lunch. Definitely too expensive for veggie dishes, over priced for sure!!! We had 3 dishes (small quantity) shared by 2 of us and the bill was nearly $100 without any drinks. Either you don't go hungry or you go ready to spend a lot of money to fill satisfied."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,AMAZING -- cannot say it enough that you need to go here today! Best vegan meal that will enter your mouth. You're palette will be screaming - YAS!
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/2/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This place was very unique with a great outdoor setting. Everything on the menu I tried was tasty. Must try if vegan, I'm vegetarian and this was very interesting for me, but everything was great."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/30/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Literally every little detail. Wonderful atmosphere. Excellent food, beautiful presentation. From the simple elegance of table decor; an air plant in a clear glass vase, to the water jug with big cork plug, the simple elegance is palpable. I had the sweet potato dumpling, Asian Bowl and the sous vide lady apple desert. I wanted to take the desert for carry out but they wouldn't serve it carry out; as not to compromise the dish or presentation. I appreciated that! I decided to order it any way.  I left stuffed. I don't normally eat that much out, but I didn't want to leave and NOT experience something from every course. My americano coffee was served with hot cashew milk; a really nice touch- and coconut sugar. I don't normally take sugar in my coffee, but I wanted to experience the  combo of cashew milk and coconut sugar. Excellent coffee. The outdoor dining beside a Grove of trees was really lovely- one tree, beautifully lit, looked like a goddess! When you eat there, look for it!  The interior seating and bar area was contemporary and hip. Can't wait to come back and enjoy another fabulous experience- this time with others who love Raw, and fresh and vegan. I was there on my own, but really wished others could experience it with me too! Next time! Thank you!"

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/25/2018,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"The bf loves to take me here on date night.  He is an omnivore, but still very much enjoys eating here.  It is very romantic and the food is delicious.  I love that they keep things raw, as I have not seen any other raw vegan fine dining establishments in Miami.  The aged nut cheeses are heavenly, as I have not tasted bleu cheese in years and this is as close as it gets.  I love a vegan restaurant that will create their own cheese, rather than throwing some Daiya on everything.  The attention to detail in each dish is awesome.,That all being said, their are a few negatives..  The parking situation is tricky if you do not want to pay for valet.  I wish the parking lot next door was just open for free parking.  The service is average.  The servers are certainly knowledgeable, but not especially attentive.  I have sat with an empty wine glass or water glass and not been asked to refill, when I would gladly order another (missed opportunity).  I also, like many other reviewers, wish the prices were slightly lower.  I understand that every dish is of great quality (not quantity), but I would like to dine here more often (certainly would if I had a higher ""dining-out budget"").,Tip:  Dining here during Miami Spice gives you a nice prix fixe option at a good price."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I'm not saying I'm going vegan, but if you are this is your place. ,First of all the setting is just amazing. Outdoor indoor seating with amazing palm trees. Very ""miamish"" you just have to visit to understand  what I mean. ,My friend is vegan and I gave him the liberty to order for me. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I know it contained ,Portobello mushrooms. Every thing was perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing. ,Weather you are visiting or live in Miami PLANT is a must,There is valet parking and also self park. ,Be advised that sometimes the have events and might be closed to the public make sure you call ahead and find out."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/29/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This place is a real gem. Located in the sacred garden venue, plant offers gourmet raw vegan cuisine.,Started off with the beets dish, very good but wouldn't recommend it to people who never had raw or vegan food. ,For my main dish I had the pasta and it was amazing. This dish could easily be served at a gourmet non vegan restaurant. ,Dessert was a sweet potatoe pie. Had better. ,Overall great food and real refreshing to see a vegan place with this quality of food. Will definitely be back!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",10/25/2017,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"Fabulous atmosphere hidden behind a gold wall. Not so easy to find. Great vegan dishes. We had a Ceasar salad, that our carnivore friend said was better than a a non vegan. It was large and cheesy with very interesting seasoning.  The avocado smash was also great with chunky chips.  My husband had a fantastic banana tamale which was warm and delicious. Our friend had a cold veggie lasagne which he devoured. ,I had the coconut ceviche tacos which I honestly was too full to eat. The were served in collard greens, which is my favorite. They were actually a little too lemony for my taste but that's kind of the ceviche flavor. ,The service was excellent as was the outdoor seats no area.  Vegans must give this place a try. Street parking by app or valet."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/12/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Wow, fantastic plant-based dishes! The taste of these dishes far exceed the vegan restaurant by my place in Maryland and I'm jealous.,Do expect to spend some money. This is an upscale place and portions are a bit small too. I had the Moroccan Bowl and while it seemed larger than some of the other dishes, it was so delicious that I really could have used another few bites! ,The other refreshing thing about this place is many of their dishes are whole/raw foods rather than full of dishes that really stretch to copy their animal-based originals. Many times, those types of recipes--in my opinion--are a flop because they try to be something they're not and they end up tasting funny.,To move on to the drinks, while you're here, order one or two! Even the nonalcoholic ones are amazing. You're already splurging by eating here, so why not have the full experience? The next time I'm in Miami, I will make a point to visit this calming, beautiful, and delicious establishment again."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/21/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This was an experience....an amazing one! The food was to die for and so elegantly displayed, a true form of art! from beginning to end the service was impeccable. I loved the Harvest Dumplings and the Cacio Di Funghi. Can't wait to return to try some of the other items they have. The seasonal and local fresh ingredients are so delicious and in most cases you can't even tell that it is a vegan restaurant. I reeeally do recommend the dishes I mentioned above, a must try for sure! Just an FYI, I am not a Vegan, and I loved this place!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Stunning restaurant! Amazing experience for brunch - we sat outside in a beautifully designed courtyard, listening to mellow Thievery Corporation, and ordered a couple of dishes and cocktails. The service was impeccable, very knowledgeable, insightful, and helpful without being pushy. The food was sooooo beautifully plated, it tasted divine, and even though it was vegan/raw, my husband (who loves meat and tends to shun anything vegetarian) and I felt very satisfied after eating.,The only negative were the shaved truffles - they were rather bland and tasteless. I'm a huge truffle fan, and these were kind of stale. ,Still I highly recommend eating here! It's pricey, yes, but it will be a very memorable experience. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/4/2017,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"This place was a really great find. Tucked away in a little hideaway in the middle of wynwood.  We had the beet toast, avocado toast, and tomale. All fantastic! Thr food is so good you dont even know its vegan.

I stumbled upon this place during a recent visit to Miami and it's making me want to extend my visit so I can come back again and again!! The food was delicious, light, filling and GORGEOUSLY presented! I didn't even want to eat some of it since it literally looked like art! The wait staff beautifully explains each dish to you as it's brought out and is incredibly attentive the whole time. ,I started with the harvest dumplings to share (sweet potato and kimchi), then got the cacio di fungi and ended with the delicious dessert special: a coconut flan! My mother got the celery root lasagna and ended with their chocolate forest special. We picked at each other's meals and it was all phenomenal. It's all RAW, healthy, tasty. ,Most vegan restaurants make up for flavor by frying, over-salting, over-oiling, etc. Not this place!! We got a tour through the kitchen after (an awesome service they provide) and there was no smell or anything bad. They have nothing to hide! Most food is dehydrated or cooked sous vide, or simply raw!,Everyone working is SO sweet and you get the chance to meet the chefs! They showed us some more dishes they were preparing which all looked phenomenal (attached photos of those too!). They also have an extensive drink list from their eco bar. ,Hoping to make it back again before leaving. It's a MUST"

I ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend (non vegan) ordered the burger. Both were delicious and she was surprised at how good the taste was. The fries were crisp and well seasoned and I even ordered from their deli some cheese so I can have some at home. Definitely check it out, especially if you do eat meat. It will shock you."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"What a neat spot with amazing food!!! Vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters alike will walk away satisfied.

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Once a year my entire family turns vegan for my brothers birthday. This is the spot he chose this year. He has frequented this spot. I have to say the services are part of what makes this place so great. We are a party of 12 and they definitely exceed their service expectations all the while being very busy as many people are coming in to pick up to go orders or place to go orders. The person in the front taking the orders (forgot name) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I wouldn't doubt if he is an owner and if he isn't, owners should know they have hired real talent. He took the time to explain the scientific process of how their products are made and was able to answer everyone's questions. He let us know what their specialties are and recommendations. Food was good. Ordered probably one of everything being that we have such a large party LOL. I recommend the mac & cheese, waffle fries, burnt barbecue tips, and burger. If you are a Vegan or just want to try some good vegan comfort food I recommend this spot. For me I have to say what made it so great was definitely the friendly and knowledgeable service. I hope that this will continue as they expand or move to a permanent location. Only reason why I couldn't give it five stars is because there is no bathroom. It appears that most people go for a quick bite or get food to go. It's almost like a food truck that's there permanently. However there is space for them to at least put a porta potty. So if you plan to eat there and don't live in the area make sure you scope out nearby public restrooms beforehand."

We tried the island Mac n cheese. My son loved it. He also had burger - *consensual meat of course*  I had the island patty melt. Last week I got the meatball with waffle fries and we had a float with vegan ice cream. You gotta try this place. The Two guys that operate the food truck are very pleasant and professional.

I have brought many omnis here, and they all love it, too.  My favorite item is the Kansas City Burnt Tip sandwich.  Tip: if you want it to go, order and pay online.  Whether you're vegan or not, try Atlas, you won't be disappointed.  :)"

As a vegan, I was excited to indulge in the fried chicken sandwich. It was pretty good but didn't blow me away. I found it a little bit greasy.

I had their patty melt and tried the burger. Both were phenomenal. They seriously give some of the better beef burgers a run for their money. The service was quick and friendly.

It's a cute, hidden vegan gem, however, I cannot give it 5 stars because some inconsiderate woman lit up a cigarette after finishing her food right next to other people still eating. Nowhere is there a nonsmoking sign and no one asked her to go elsewhere with her cancer stick. Again, food, service and ambience are great--just wish there were non smoking signs up for people who clearly have no manners."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This is my favorite vegan spot. I am so happy they finally opened a location in Miami. Located off 79th street they are currently serving out of their food truck, which is parked on their future permanent restaurant property, (currently being remodeled and crossing fingers will be ready in September).,For now, you can make yourself comfortable at one of their covered picnic tables and wait for your name to be called. My current favorite is the Island patty which doesn't look as impressive as the others but delivers in flavor. It is a burger patty served on rye with caramelized onions and their delicious island mac sauce. I also like the classic which is a big mac style burger and their fried chicken sandwich is very popular too except i find the ""chicken patty to thick for my taste"". They have added new items as well such as loaded fries and chicken tenders. You can turn any of your sandwiches into a combo with waffle fries and a drink (which you can pick out from one of their coolers). ,This is a laid back atmosphere focused on serving high quality, tasty, vegan comfort food. And I'm obsessed! if you don't believe me, Miami New times voted them best vegan restaurant of 2017! Need I say more?"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Finally got to stop here for lunch today! It's a food truck that's a bit hidden off a side street. We were hesitant on sitting outside in this insane heat, but between the umbrellas and all the fans they had going we were actually quite comfortable. Great customer service followed by yummy vegan comfort food!! We started with the Island Mac and Cheese... I've had many vegan Mac and cheeses and this one was definitely unique and tasty! Then we got the classic burger and the Kansas City burnt tips sandwich, both served on a delicious pretzel bun... Both were really good but the the Kansas City burnt tips was definitely my favorite of the two. They were extremely filling despite what some would think of vegan sandwiches. We left stuffed!! I definitely want to come back to try the chicken sandwich!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Oh, how I love meatless (vegan) places that aren't ""raw"" or just some wilted salads.  This place is AMAZING and I finally got to try it today (they have new, better hours).,The place is quite charming.  A food truck with a little garden area with picnic benches, a big fan, and nice people.,I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  OMG, huge portion for a very reasonable price.  The ""chicken"" was perfectly cooked and was real stick-to-your-ribs food.  It was really more than I could eat (consider sharing).   I also had a side of delicious fries (for like $3 more you can add a drink and fries).  There were a lot of people there today enjoying this meat-free, delicious food that no animals were harmed for.,I have nothing bad at all to say.  The guy taking the orders was very nice, and the chef was also super-nice.  I ordered a couple things left off my sandwich (cheese and some garlic stuff), and he perfectly accommodated that request.  I can't wait to go back and try something different.  All good!  Love Atlas!,p.s.  There's plenty of free street parking across from it, and also several places in front of it."

If you have ever thought about being vegan or just want to eat a healthier lifestyle, check out this little place. We had the meatball sub and the burnt tip bbq sandwich. They were both so good and you would never know that it was veggies!"

No trendy over priced tiny portions, the sandwiches are giant and reasonably priced! The ""chicken"" is so fluffy and savory. Fries are a bit over seasoned but def get the garlic aioli to dip them in! Cute backyard spot just wish they were open later. Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/21/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,All I have to say is... O.M.G. This vegan comfort food was so freaking great! They make everything from scratch including their dipping sauces and cheeses. Definitely should check em out if you're in Miami!

Took a few non-veg humans out here and they just adored it :) As a vegan, this is now easily one of my favorite spots! We got some great recommendations from the host and they were perfect. Yay for genuinely delicious vegan fake meats!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/31/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Amazing vegan food! I've been here a few times and would highly recommend the loaded fries and the fried chicken sandwich. Yumm. I also love that they always have deals going on Yelp and Groupon. The only downside I noticed during my last visit was that there was a significant amount of fruit flies swarming us which made it hard to sit and enjoy the food. It had just rained earlier in the day so that could be the reason but it's definitely an easy fix for them so don't let it deter you from coming here.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My favvvv place in Miami ever!!!! Annnnnd my non vegan friends enjoy it too which is deff a plus. My favorite is the buttamilk chickn sandwich with loaded fries... their garlic aoli is super bomb so i don't mind paying the extra fee. Super reasonable prices. Thank youuuuu for providing the best food in town
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/30/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I usually have their vegan comfort food at the Yellow Green Market in Hollywood, but today I worked half day, and decided to stop by  their Miami location. Well, food truck that is...,They have limited hours (11-3pm, tue-fr), so to finally been able to catch them open, was a hit.,Geezzz... Miami heat it's unforgivable... I was planning to eat right there, but the 96 degrees were brutal. They have 2 large picnic tables, where patrons sit family style. One tiny fan didn't do it for me. They are serving from their food truck until September 2017, when their brick&mortar place will be ready next door.,They got busy very fast and suddenly we were like five people  waiting for our orders... ,So, I got their classic single patty burger with fries and a bottle of water for $13. ,Vegan burger was super delicious, super moist, filled with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  However,  next time I'll get the double patty. I wanted more, like a vegan vampire. ,I always want more!!!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is the perfect spot for vegans who still love American classics! Everything on the menu is vegan, but closely resembles your favorite dishes (the loaded fried, classic burgers, Mac and cheese, and soda floats are our favorite!) ,Even though the location is a bit tricky for find, it is worth the search. Free street parking is located right outside of the eatery (which is rare in Miami). The outside eating area is great for sunny warm days, and the truck also offers daily happy hours deals from 1-3pm. On weekends and during lunch time I suggest ordering food to-go on their website or calling it in, to avoid long wait times. , ,Prices are a bit expensive ($15-$20 a person), but for miami that is expected, and for quality vegan food I'm willing to pay up.  South Florida is in need of some tasty vegan food and Atlas delivers!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Very flavorful classics but substituting the meat for meatless. I had the meatball sub and it was exceptional! Really great and I did not miss the meat at all. The meatless meatballs were amazing! This isn't your typical vegan place as many will think. They have bread, fries, sodas, so it's not one of those ultra-healthy places. Definitely a place I will come back to. Right now they are a food truck but soon to open a brick and mortar. I can't wait!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/27/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Wow, this humble looking spot is absolutely amazing! I would give more stars if I could. I went to Atlas meat-free deli yesterday because one of my best friends was visiting and she is a vegan, my boyfriend and I are not but all three of us loved our lunch. Everything is delicious, fairly priced and our food didn't take long at all. I would suggest the loaded fries! The ""meat"" on them has great flavor and texture, and their ""Mac sauce"" is super tasty as well. We also got the patty melt which I loved and the classic burger which has a nice ""meaty"" texture to it. My friend got the Mac and cheese, it tasted clean and creamy. She also got the hot wings, which are very spicy so be aware. I can't wait to go back and try their other enticing menu items. If you're looking for vegan comfort food this is your spot! Adorable food truck set up with charming ambience and tables. This is a must try!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"OMGosh! So delicious. My boyfriend and I had a Groupon and decided to try it and I am so glad we did. We tried the Buttermilk fried chic'n sandwich with coleslaw, vegan cheese, pickles in a pretzel bun. Amazinggggg. We also ordered the Island mac and cheese, it was creamy goodness with a very unique but perfectly executed twist on your traditional mac and cheese. Atmosphere is really quaint and surprisingly private. Overall it was fantastic. Will be back soon!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/18/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is a literal diamond in the rough! Don't let the area deter you from trying out some of the best vegan food you'll ever find. The guys at Atlas do a phenomenal job at preparing some of the best deli style dishes that keep me coming back for more. From their Deli sub to their loaded fries, everything in their menu is delicious. This place closes a little early, and sometimes certain dishes sell out, so Postmates comes in the clutch sometimes. One of the other cool things about Atlas is that you can purchase their vegan ""meats and cheeses"" by the pound, amazing! Try out the vegan cheese and enjoy the nice seating area to soak in some Miami sun. One of my favorite places in Miami!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"We found this hidden gem while running errands in the area, and all I can say is wow! While health is very important to us, finding a balance between food that's good for you without compromising taste has been tough. My ex carnivore boyfriend has had trouble fully transitioning to vegan because he still craves meat! Atlas has the perfect solutions for him, a vegan place with a full bbq menu! It's nothing fancy but it does have a cute little courtyard to enjoy your meal at! This place was a great idea and I highly recommended it to anyone who is trying to make the transition away from meat!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is an amazing example that vegan food isn't boring! They kill it with their entire menu, but my favorites are the fried chicken sandwich, loaded fries & deli style sub sandwich. My partner loves the burnt tips!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/29/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My kids are extremely picky and they love Atlas chickn tenders and classic burger. You can't go wrong with the Kansas City Burt Tip and the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n. They are vegan comfort food at its best!
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Really friendly staff, the sweetest staff I have met. I was recommended the vegan fried chicken sandwich and it was incredible. The sauce on the chicken was the perfect tangy counterpart. The sandwich was so hefty and filling. Their french fries were also so flavorful. It was the best vegan comfort food that I had have in a while."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/22/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I've been here a few times and they have the most delicious vegan food I've ever had. Their ""chicken"" sandwhich is my go-to, and I will never get tired of it. Their mac-and-cheese is spectacular and their loaded fries are also amazing. Thr wait is usually a bit long, but if you order ahead of time, you can save yourself the wait. The food is completely worth the wait though!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/1/2017,$,3,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This was the next stop on my vegetarian/vegan chronicles. I was a little more pumped for this place because the pictures sold it as classic comfort or junk food. ,Ordered with our eyes, per usual.,Got the chickan wings- and I have to say, it was cute. Wrapped the doughy concoction on an ice cream stick to resemble wings. Taste did not match appearance. It was like bread slathered in buffalo sauce. Spicy bread on a stick. They were out of ranch sauce too, that is like a problem. Spicy anything needs a cooling agent.,Got the island patty because they were out of the meatball sub.,I am not typically a fan of rye bread so maybe my bias was on high- but I didn't love this sandwich. The caramelizad onions were good but the sauce is just not great for me. I didn't hate this, I would maybe try again on regular bread. Not sure.,We also ordered the loaded fries. Obviously this was my favorite thing. How do you go wrong with potatoes? Waffle cut style was great. I didn't love the sour cream or cheeze sauce they covered it in but whatever they use for the pastrami burnt ends that was pretty good. ,I don't love that water bottles here are small and over priced.,Maybe if my vegan friend demands we go again I'll try a second time so long as I can order the meatballs and give those a go."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Delicious all vegan food. The island Patty and the loaded fries were a perfect remedy for my hangover
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/8/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"If you like good comfort food, go here. If you are vegan, go here. If you are not vegan, still go here. If you want an idea of how good the food is here, we went while around the area in the pouring rain and there were STILL people waiting, soaking wet, for their food. The cashier guy taking our orders (bless him) had a smile on his face the entire time and greeted us warmly, despite being soaked and probably near hypothermic. I do not recommend coming here with a large party or on a really hot/rainy day seeing as this is a food truck with a small outdoor sitting area. We ordered the sausage and peppers sub and chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese not really knowing what to expect and I couldn't be more glad for that! I had zero expectations and was so pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious and so close to the real thing. The mac and cheese was a little demurely seasoned and could have used some more salt but overall we were happy with our orders. Atlas is representing vegan food the way it should be represented!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Come here hungry and leave satisfied. Their burgers and sandwiches are everything. I've had a lot of good vegan sandwiches in my life and I'm going to say that for now, the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n has to be my fav.  The loaded fries were on point too and I appreciate the seasoning. ,The food did not arrive as fast as I am used to, but it was well worth the little wait. There is enough shade to block out the sun, and it feels very intimate and cozy, almost like I was in the back of a family cookout or something, but everyone there were strangers of course. It was just the vibe."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/7/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Stopped by Atlas with a friend to grab some hearty vegan food before hitting the beach. I'm glad I wasn't in too much of a rush, because, as a food truck, Atlas is small and gets busy fast--my friend and I waited almost an hour for our food. Normally I would knock a star off for such a long wait, but it was evident that there were a lot of orders and not a lot of time so 5 stars it is!,Since I wasn't planning on getting in the water or wearing a bathing suit, I wasn't afraid of having a food baby and decided to go big and order the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (at the suggestion of the cashier as well). It was the best decision EVER. ,First of all, the sandwich was the perfect size and so incredibly filling. For $9, I was thoroughly satisfied. I was absolutely stuffed at the end of this meal. The breaded and fried ""chicken"" cutlet was hearty and, although I usually don't care for fried foods, delicious. The slaw and rest of the sandwich toppings complemented it perfectly and gave the sandwich a fantastic range of flavors and textures. ,Overall, going to Atlas was an awesome choice, and I will definitely be back again. Would recommend!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/25/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I can take my non vegan friends here and they find the meals enjoyable: perk #1. Food is decadent to say the least and packed with flavor. They make everything in their kitchen as they have heir own vegan deli: perk #2. Love the waffle fries and the  buttermilk chicken, classic burger, LOADED FRIES, meatball sub and must definitely try the rest of the menu items, so plenty of visits left unless I plan for a Mukbang . Recommendation: go early or order ahead as in my experience they sell out of the popular items pretty quickly. Perk #3: Prices are right. ,Big yay for atmosphere and service with a smile.,Hoping for more locations in the South Miami area."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/20/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"SUPERB!!!! That's all I have to say about Atlas. I was shooketh of how flavorful a lot of the food were since it's vegan. The cheese sauce is so good!! I wish I can just sip it with a straw (jk but that's how good it is). The buttermilk ""chicken"" sandwich almost tastes like a real chicken sandwich. The loaded fries are delicious too. I think my favorite would have to be between the meatball marinara and classic burger! Both were just kicking my tastebuds with all the flavor and tasted almost identical to real meat. The meatball marinara has a strong taste of thyme (I think it's thyme, I don't mind it though). They also had a special sandwich, the Chimichurri Steak Special, and it was good! It was such a hit they're planning to add it to the regular menu. The server who takes the orders is so nice! He came back a couple times to check how we were doing. ,The only thing though is both times I've gone, I go a little late around 3:30-4ish. So by the time I go, a lot of things are sold out. I definitely recommend going earlier! The Mac and cheese ended up being cold. But everything was still delicious. ,Parking is a bit difficult if it gets packed since it's all street parking.,The sauce for the buttermilk tenders was a bit bland. I hope they can made a better sauce to go with it. ,Overall, I think it's great. I would definitely come back. Groupon also offers a deal for $12 on $20 worth of food! Check it out!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/25/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas Meat-Free began in the humble settings of the Yellow Green farmers market, but due to their popularity among the vegan debutantes they eventually branched out into Wynwood and then relocated to 79st. ,It was at the the YG farmers market that I first encountered Atlas Meat-Free, but the couple of times that I came I left unimpressed. Both times I ordered their much coveted marinara meatball hoagie that unfortunately lacked in any depth in flavor.,My yelp budette Nathaly L. who's a Liberal vegan activist was shocked that I didn't like the food here. She guaranteed that I would like this place, and that she personally was going take me there for lunch.,Fast forward a few months later, I get a text from Nathaly asking me to meet her at Atlas for lunch and that she was treating. Typically I don't allow Beautiful Latina women to treat me, I personally prefer to devoutly serve them, but I accepted her offer.,Finding this place was kind of annoying because they're located in a food truck hidden behind the building with their business address.,Nathaly asked me what I wanted and I told her I'll have whatever she's having ,Ordered :,2 Island Patty Melts - atlas ground burger with caramelized onions and island mac sauce, grilled pressed on rye ($9),1 Loaded Fries - seasoned waffle fries with garlic aioli and island mac sauce, topped with atlas burnt pastrami tips and jalapeños ($9),We got two free bottled waters with the yelp check-in.,Wow portions are huge, especially the fries, we couldn't even finish them.,Outside of Treelion and Konatas, this is the only other vegetarian/vegan place I know of that serves such generous portions.,The Patty melts were impressive, everything about them was tasty and filling, especially the caramelized onions.,The fries were delicious, almost perfect, this is actually the first time I've been able to eat fries without ketchup.,So my attractive little vegan debutante friend Nathaly L. won this round.,A note to consider: VEGAN does not equal GMO-free, pesticide free, organic or preservative free. I haven't seen anywhere on Atlas-free's website nor menu's stating it's free of any of the above aforementioned. Neither do they mention if their bread is free of HFCS or Potassium bromate(this crap causes hypothyroid).,In reality vegan just means that you're not eating another living beings foot or tail Etc."

I would first say the location of this place is not very good, but they do have a very cute set up. I got a burger and although it looked very presentable there was something in it that tasted a bit sour. I only ate about half of it and had stomach pains the rest of the night. The fries were delicious though ...they also did not have many drink selections. This is a vegan fast food as the food is vegan but not all too healthy."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/31/2018,$$,3,Le Pain Quotidien,They need to work on the availability of the menu items. Being vegan it's hard to make this a go to because they are quite often out of the vegan choices. Also the hours of operation are not early enough for a bakery or late enough for a restaurant....figure yourselves out and adjust your hours accordingly!

My neighbors directed me to B&M and it remains my favorite Caribbean food source in Miami.,Experience: Delicious every time. Inexpensive. Fairly fast. Super friendly folks. Try the veggie plate (ask for extra cabbage and pumpkin). The fish stew is also divine.  ,Bottom Line: B&M is one of Miami's hidden gems."

Food is solid Persian, great portions, AMAZING sauce and a lot of options from different veggies to falafel to chicken, pork and beef (even fish). Really tasty and fresh, nice clean location. The only complaint was that one time I went there during rush lunch hour and the kitchen was having a delay and they told us the wait would be 45 minutes, so we left. But that was only one time, and come on, those things happen everywhere once, so obviously we just came back another day and enjoyed deliciousness once more. It's quick without being a fast food and healthy (MAJOR PLUS). I would recommend the hummus, grape leaves and falafel but I bet meat eaters would love everything else the same. :)"

They have vegan coconut yogurt which makes my dietitian heart sing, and an array of other plant-based options (the lentil soup was divine - love the little tiny French lentil variety) and combined with the zucchini noodle pad thai was a sumptuous lunch. I've also had the cheese plate, and again, as a dietitian, that makes me one happy chick - since I studied abroad in France and had this every day for lunch (plenty of protein and relax - cheese is good for you). The service is divine and friendly and the price is perfect. I'M SO IN LOVE."

So she was able to order some vegan noodles which she was happy with and ate all of her food. We had a side order of tostones, you can't go wrong with tostones.

The banana quinoa muffin is my favorite and a must try. They have many vegan and vegetarian options as well. The food is a bit pricey, but you are getting quality in all the dishes!"
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2017,$$,5,OTL,"First, the food. I came here for lunch hoping to have a light and healthy meal to keep my day going.  I ordered an Avocado Toast (Vegan) and a Banana Quinoa muffin. It was delicious, you can taste that the avocado was freshly made this morning and the muffin was freshly baked as well. ,Second, the location and decor is simplistic yet very well suited for the area. Located right in the heart of the design destrict next to stores such as LV and Prada. Meter parking can be a little difficult during peak times but there is a garage down the street if you can't find parking. ,Third, service and staff were great. Lots of smiles and prompt responses to my requests. I felt like I was talking with a friend when interacting with them. Even during a rush hour, staff was attentive to the needs of their customers. The manager also come by with a smile to make sure my experience was going well. ,In conclusion, I can't find many problems with this cafe. You can go from a casual lunch, to a business meeting, to study time or a romantic dinner date. The place fits most situations very well and I will be recommending it to others."
"160 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/11/2018,$$,5,OTL,"OTL is in the heart of the design district in Miami, and is such a great place to grab a bite and read your favorite book. The atmosphere is absolutely precious, and the food is just as great! I went with my best friend, she had the Manchego & Pear Sandwich (all of their breads are provided by Zak the baker. Yum!) with matcha lemonade (Delicious. Not too sweet. It was perfect), and I had their Avocado toast, Genmaicha, and a Vegan Chai cookie. ,My avocado toast was perfect. It was a bit hot from the Chili flakes, but overall delicious. The radishes really add a nice bite to the toast. If you're wondering what Genmaicha is, it's a green tea with toasted rice. It may sound weird, but try it! It's a must have if you're into tea. ,Now for the star of the menu, the Vegan Chai cookie. I'm not sure how it's vegan, because it taste better than most non- vegan cookies. It's spicy, salty, and sweet at the same time. So delicious! It reminded me a lot of a snickerdoodle cookie. I highly recommend it."
"901 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",8/30/2015,$$,3,Balans Restaurant & Bar - Brickell,"411 on Mushroom Tofu Burger - delish, but for u vegans out there, u may be sorely disappointed (or pissed off) that there is HAM in the kale and sweet potato side! Two huge thumbs down  for a crappy combo of a vegan burger and a meat-infused side. We like Balans and will return, but please fix this discrepancy."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",1/18/2015,$$,3,Ironside Kitchen,"This establishment is such a diamond in the rough in a transition neighborhood that I was excited to explore this place before going to see a movie at nearby O Cinema Miami Shores.  The outside patio and table lay out is casual, rustic, inviting and artistic (5 stars); the friendliness of the manager is genuine, sincere and delightfully Italian (5 stars); the service - is a work in progress - inconsistent and sporadic (3 stars), but in the end a pizza place must be judged by its pizza.  While the flavors were fresh, and the thinness gave it a crispy crunch, taking the first bite gave me a sense of below average amazement.  I kept taking bites to figure out what was missing and while I thought it was a general under seasoning of garlic, upon further taste bud analysis - the sauce became the culprit. It was missing its zest, it's tomatoey base from which to build upon a potential mouth watering experience (2.5 stars).   Now I applaud the gluten free and vegan options available, but in the end it may be that here they serve Roman style flatbread and I'm used to American NY style pizza.  When the next craving comes, where will you pizza it up?"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",11/22/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Doesn't get better than this. It began with the manager Matteo actually coming out of the restaurant and onto the street to help us find a parking spot. Then came the most amazing food. We are vegan and gluten free and can never find great places to eat. The gluten free crust wasn't your typical bland soggy yuck... It is homemade with special flour from Italy. Best crust we've ever had! Matteo served us wine (free because as he explained he was sorry it took so long to find a parking space)! The salads were beyond description...the spinach and the arugula ones. Basically one of the better meals us vegans have had in a long time. Can't imagine how fantastic it is for all of the folks who eat it all! Run to Ironside!
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",12/28/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This is my new favorite restaurant. First off all, the atmosphere is great...you feel like you're at a cafe in Europe. You would never know you were in miami. The service was incredible, with the owner checking on us multiple times. They also served a complimentary dessert...Nutella pizza. Did I mention of great the pizza was? Probably the best and most authentic pizza I've ever had in miami. Also...there are lots of vegetarian and vegan options. I am vegan and ordered the vegan pizza and it was delicious. The rest of my party were meat eaters and were equally happy with their dishes. I stumbled upon this restaurant randomly online and I'm so glad I checked it out. I will be back very soon!!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",7/3/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Just came by for the 1st time. Great Experience! Great Service! Great Food! Very fresh, by far my new favorite pizza place in Miami.  My wife also loved the vegan cheese option!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",10/29/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This place is a much-needed addition to the neighborhood! Fresh, authentic pizza tasted amazing, and they even offer vegan cheese and gluten-free crust. I had my pizza with both of these options and it was honestly incredible. The service was great, and the vibes were awesome. Great setup and perfect for a low-key date night... let's keep this place alive and thriving."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",8/11/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"This place is delicious! Almost drove right by it. thanks to another yelp review and pictures I knew to look for the faces. I got the gluten free crust with vegan cheese, soo good. The crust was delicious! Also the Nutella pizza for dessert.. Yumm. Cute little place, Very friendly staff. Definitely will be back."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",2/4/2014,$$,4,Ironside Kitchen,"The good: food and service were great, isn't that what really matters?  The atmosphere was nice as well, tucked in a funky block with plenty of nature and nearby vegan dessert place.  Ordered a vegan pita and vegan calzone, bread/crust was really excellent, toppings were very good.,The questionable: place was dead however there are 2 important considerations - the place had only been open a short while so will take a while for word to get out, and  it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday,So there you have it.  A solid place regardless of diet, and exceptionally solid for vegans."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",10/1/2016,$$,3,Ironside Kitchen,"I came here like 2 years ago and the pizza was soupy. I finally came back last night and I actually really enjoyed it. I love that they offer vegan cheese for no additional charge. I had an Italian nona and their pesto pasta reminded me of hers. Three stars because although the food was good it was pricey. Made In Italy has INCREDIBLE pasta and for less. Also, when we first walked in we expressed we wanted to sit on the other side where the pizza oven is but the owner behind the counter insisted so much we sit in the cafe that we felt forced to sit there. Even though he meant it with good intentions it was a bit ""ugh"". Also, their manager a bald guy is boisterous and loud. He walks around nervously trying to handle stuff and accommodate people and yells a lot of ""prego's"" and ""grazi's"" which make the place somehow feel more authentic. Besides that the restaurant is pleasant, clean and I enjoy their cute cafe during the day. I must also ack that I could taste the difference in the food now compared to the last time I was here. I also like that it's located in a more hidden part of the area. You're more than likely a local if you're here."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",3/25/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Really good vegan cheese. Probably one of the best vegan pizza I've ever had.
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",1/24/2014,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Vegan pizza WIN. The chewy crust, the flavorful sauce, the Daiya ""cheese"", the impossibly fresh veggies! Taken together, they made the absence of dairy totally unnoticeable. Who knew vegan pizza could be better than the regular?,Pair this deliciousness with shady palms, comfy couches and the laid-back tenants of Iron Side, and this is a hell of a place for a lunch date.,It's spots like this that make veganism a joy. ,Did I mention House of V cupcakes right next door, for vegan dessert? Happy dance!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",5/29/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Best vegan pizza in Miami!!! Their crust is also amazing!!! I love that they don't, like a lot of other places, charge extra for vegan cheese. The atmosphere is lovely and the people extremely friendly. Can't wait to go back and eat more!"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",4/15/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Great place! You can bring your own wine and no charge for it. I even saw people bring their own 24-pack of beer. They have vegan options and price is fair. If you are sitting outside eating and it starts pouring they got you covered, no need to move from your comfortably spot."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",5/10/2016,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"-- Vegan-friendly pizza --,A review for any vegan out there searching for authentic, Italian wood-fire pizza in Miami. This restaurant, located in an unassuming area on the outskirts of Biscayne, is one of the few authentic Italian pizzerias that cater to plant-based, pizza-aficionados.,-- Morelli's advice -- ,I first learned about Ironside through an Italian cafe owner after enquiring about the ""Best Pizza in Miami"". He mentioned Ironside and its pizzero, then, a six-time world champion pizza-maker in Italy, and how he was running the show. Say no more -- I'm there. ,-- Champ nowhere to be found --,Days later, I am there - at Ironside. So I head to Ironside ecstatic to have my own pizza made by the champ himself. Unfortunately for me, by the time I got there, the six-time world champion was nowhere to be found. In fact, he was no longer even working there. My server gave a hint that it was ""politics"" - ""things just didn't work out"". He shied away in giving an any real explanation, but it was understandable. ,-- How's that pizza, you dirty pizza-punk? -- ,In any case, the pies here are authentic and delicious. ,Look, vegan pizza doesn't have to suck. I mean, it won't be too long before plant-based cheese can perfectly replicate your favorite cheese on a molecular level. ,But the crust and thick tomato sauce alone was making me fiend for more. The icing on the cake was the legit EVOO straight from some vineyard in Italy and the homemade peppers and capers in a Mason, glass jar.,Pizza * 10/10,Service * 9/10"
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",7/2/2017,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Delicious pizza! Bring your own wine. I am a vegan, and they have plenty of options for vegans."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",3/21/2018,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,"Great little place that is absolutely PERFECT for dinner parties. Mostly outdoor seating - in a very cute courtyard. BYOB with no corking fee. Delicious pizza, comparable to Anthony's but perhaps better. Wonderful salads and pasta is good. The eggplant appetizer is a favorite of everyone I know. Great service, especially for a dinner party (10 people, lots of orders, and nothing came out wrong). No charge for birthday cake slicing/plating either. Vegetarian options, as well as technically ""vegan"" if you get the salads without the cheese. I was impressed by their salad and antipasti selection - I was under the assumption it was a mostly pizza/pasta place. A true gem in the middle of what seems like nowhere! This is also a pet-friendly place (from what I gathered - 2 people I've seen bring dogs) if you sit outside. Casual atmosphere. Cute for date, family dinner, or parties. They also have an ""unlimited"" menu for parties of 8 or more where you pay $30/pp to order any amount for the table of what is on the prix fixe menu."
"7580 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33138",6/2/2018,$$,5,Ironside Kitchen,Went with my boyfriend with some whiskey! I ordered the gluten free pizza and vegan mozzarella and WOW! The service was great as well. Thank you!

"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/12/2016,$$,5,grown,"Wow! Can't even begin to explain how special this place is. From the food, the vibe, and especially the owner, Shannon! We had the vegan & gluten free soup which was incredible!!! Also sampled the salmon burger & eggplant sandwiches which I'm craving already. They have many community events and specials so check out the instagram page. (That's how I found out about free yoga & yummy bites afterwards). The owner is incredible. Her mission is so clear and that is to spread the word about an organic lifestyle and cater to those who believe so deeply in it like she does. She literally went around from to table to table to speak to guests. If you aren't aware, she is Ray Allen's wife. The reason I bring that up is because she doesn't have to be running this restaurant, she has money. She does it because she truly has a passion and cares! She orders everything from the restaurant herself and makes sure it is locally sourced and organic! From the fruits, veggies, & meats! She also stores EVERYTHING in BPA free containers. Why would she do that? It is triple the amount of money and nobody will ever know. Again, because she CARES! What a beautiful lady , inside & out! Can't wait to go back (especially to try breakfast). By the way, GROWN caters to EVERYONE! Vegans, gluten intolerant, meat lovers...oh and wine lovers too! Check them out, you won't regret. P.S: For those complaining about price.. organic food (especially how they order) is pricey, you will not find that anywhere! Your body is a temple, take care of it! No amount of money can replace sickness or disease. There is no price on good health."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/24/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"I don't want to give this review as a recent convert to veganism, but as someone who has traveled quite a bit and has experienced different cuisines from all over the United States, Latin America, and Europe. I purposely seek out small family owned restaurants and shy away from chains.,Buffalo Bob is probably the best pizza I have ever had. The chicken was very tasty and was not overpowered with buffalo sauce. The cheese was just perfectly extra on the pizza, and the crust was fantastic. We followed up with ice cream. I had the Brownie Sunday, which after I had customized it was more like some hardcore chocolate on chocolate action. ,On the owners advice we returned the next morning for pancakes and holy cow! The banana blueberry pancakes were fire. The scramble was not missing anything (coming from a recent non-vegan background its hard to fool me) but my favorite was the sausage patties.,Ethically sourced food this good makes the conversion to full veganism a no brainer. Why not promote peace and love for our fellow creatures and inhabitants of this fascinating rock hurtling through space at 26 thousand miles an hour through some damn tasty food?!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/13/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"Knowing how great Choices Organic Café is, we knew we had to try this pizza place as soon as it opened. The outdoor seating setup is the same casual Grove dining as Choices, and the order by tablet option was quick/painless. While we ordered with the tablet, all of the staff were super nice and updated us as we waited on our pizza. Speaking of the pizza (Helen of Napoli): it was absolutely incredible, made to order with fresh ingredients, and worth the wait. We both agreed that it was the best vegan pizza either of us had ever had. It's essentially potatoes au gratin/loaded baked potato over a spectacular, risen-crust pizza. It was perfectly paired with a cup of delightfully sour mango lime kombucha to wash it down. Do yourself a favor and get some of this pizza in your mouth!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/1/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,Calling all vegans and non vegans!! Best vegan pizza hands down. The dough and cheese were both delicious. Comfort food pizza at its finest. I came with a big group and we got all the pizzas. The blueberry one was delicious. Definitely more savory than sweet so it was a nice surprise! Coming back next weekend for the opening of the ice cream shop!
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/9/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"Hands down best pizza I have ever had, vegan or not. The first time I showed up they were closed and cleaning up and still offered to bake up 3 pizzas and make 3 smoothies from Neo's Blender (in the same VShops Food Hall). Paid parking lot next door is easy but I have heard they boot if you are even a minute late, but for $3/hour ($1/20 mins), pay the extra :),I have had the Buffalo pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/29/2018,$$,5,Next Generation Pizza,"It's in the building with the blue umbrellas. Holy crap was this phenomenal vegan food. Just order the blueberry pizza.

First of all, the staff is so friendly; the owners are incredibly accommodating with a kindness beyond compare and the food is to die for. Everything from the warm toasted paninis to the delectable ice creams. It's all so amazing. There's a cozy back patio, too. And vegetarian \ vegan options too. At Cream Parlor, every experience you have is a memorable one. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"

The place is cozy with a few tables inside and there is a very nice outdoor patio in the rear that I loved. I enjoyed convo, icecream and the Avocado vegan toast there and felt very relaxed and comfortable. definitely a go to on an easy beeezy Sunday night!,I had a scoop of the unicorn poop + a scoop of the rum raisin and they were both delicious...nothing out of this world flavor wise but ice cream is ice cream.,Very family friendly place and I might be a bit weird but I wish they served some wine here for the grown ups too, while the kids enjoy their cones. the food menu needs some work as it relates to a more varied options but overall. I loved the ambiance. Wine, would make it truly official in my book.,."
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",8/30/2017,$$,3,Cream Parlor,"This place is good place to enjoy some very delicious ice cream, if you are not vegan then you would love Cream Parlor they invent new ice cream flavors every week which I think is amazing plus their food is also very full of delicious flavors, I would just say that the food is vey greasy so you might want to watch out for that ..."
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/10/2018,$$,5,Cream Parlor,"Oh my god! This place so so cute and has awesome food and service. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the curry bowl and the hummus makes it so BOMB!!!!! So flavorful and tangy and slightly smoky. Excellent vegan or vegetarian option. I also had the prosciutto toast with the apricot jam and goat cheese. Ugh, the flavors in my mouth...I saved a bite to have as the last thing in my mouth. My friend got a smashed potato with eggs bacon and cheese and she loved it. They take a whole baked potato and press it in the panini press until it becomes crispy and delicious and then topped it was eggs, cheese , and a mountain of bacon. And then the dessert. Make sure to try their ice cream flavors and then get an out of this world Sundae or malted milkshake!"
"8224 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/27/2017,$$,4,Cream Parlor,"Feel like I found a gem not far from home!

They are always willing to accommodate my request to make certain dishes vegan and answer any questions I have with regards to a dish and what it contains. I have the pad thai with tofu and their coconut soup. Their food is always delicious and I would highly recommend trying them.

"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/17/2016,$$,4,grown,Excellent food overall. Had the free range chicken wrap Capri Salad Style along with a vegan minestrone soup. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion for a fast food type of place.
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",5/25/2016,$$,4,grown,"A nice fast food restaurant. The employees were very friendly. They greeted each customer immediately at the door. The sitting area was very cute. The tables were a little small but I think that for a fast food restaurant it is not a big issue. We ordered two smoothies, a salad with Havana vibe and salmon, and a wrap with salmon. The food came with soups - Chicken tortilla and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup. The food was very good. All ingredients were fresh and tasted delicious. The only thing that surprised me was the bill. The food is a little bit too pricey for a fast food restaurant. The total bill was $58! But I guess they have to pay the Pinecrest's rent!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/30/2016,$$,5,grown,"Only been open a month and is doing very well! Everything on the menu is incredibly fresh , the ambiance is adorably cute, and there is open-air (covered) seating. I had the Grown Simple Greens wrap and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup which were delicious. The silverware and plates are made of renewable materials and the juices are amazing. Try the Love Greens!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/4/2017,$$,5,grown,"Food that tastes great and makes you feel good ordering. Everything is USDA organic. This is also an excellent place for vegetarians, vegans, people with dietary restrictions, allergies, etc. ,The salmon was fine dining quality on a paper plate. I recommend trying the Mexican corn. ,Since it is was our first time, the manager, Chris, walked us through the menu and gave us samples to try. Bonus points for excellent service. ,As others have mentioned, this place is more expensive than other counter service restaurants, but I would argue the food quality and taste is MUCH better. We enjoyed dinner so much, we splurged for dessert (something we rarely do). Excellent too!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",1/4/2017,$$,4,grown,"I enjoyed my visit here when I came early on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend. The food was tasty enough, and there were plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. The reason why I give this restaurant four stars instead of five is because it was extremely pricey for the portion sizes we were getting. We both left feeling hungry after spending $xx amount on our breakfasts. I wish they had bigger portion sizes. Also, it gets very crowded on weekends, mainly with local families coming after a soccer match, etc."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",3/30/2017,$$,5,grown,"I loved this restaurant!!  I had the wild salmon on a gluten free wrap with the simple greens, soup was included and I had the chicken and mushroom. My soup was very tasty and my wrap was scrumptious!  I was only able to have half of my wrap because it's quite large so next time I'll order an extra soup and share the wrap. I didn't have dessert but on my way out saw they had vegan and gluten free desserts which I will try next time. Can't wait to visit them again. ,Ps- I was very impressed that they had Rudi's gluten free bread, wild salmon and free range chicken. I wish I would've had access to a ""fast food restaurant"" like this when my kids were small. I'll definitely be taking my grandkids!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/16/2017,$$,5,grown,Stopped in for lunch for the first time.  Simply amazed! The owner Shannon was very wonderful and informative on the healthy styles of eating. We were offered a complimentary dessert that was vegan delicious.
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",6/5/2017,$$,3,grown,"I heard a lot of hype coming into this place, and while the food is fine, it's nothing all that outstanding.  I came for breakfast, and it seems like a great deal that you can get home fries, bacon, and fruit for $5, until you see that it's less food than you would've gotten for the same price at IHOP.  For all the gluten-free, local-source, vegan-friendly, blah, blah, blah, you see, the food was pretty bland and basic.  I'm not saying the food isn't good.  I'm just saying that their cage-free, macrobiotic, whatever, whatever eggs taste the same as what I have in my fridge from Publix.  Now, I'm not going to lie, their juices and smoothies are really good, but they set you back about $10.  If paying $10 for a great smoothie is something that wouldn't bother you, then grown is right up your alley."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/1/2018,$$,3,grown,"So, this place is delicious and healthy and yes everything tastes extremely fresh and natural however ridiculously overpriced. TWO wraps and a cookie came out to $42!!! What?! Kind of insane. I was shocked at how expensive it was. I tried the Mediterranean wrap and the Havana wrap both with chicken- they were delicious I can't deny that. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was also amazing- very flavorful and yummy. Decorated very cute. I wish there were more places like this- they even have a drive thru. My only complain was the price and it's a shame but I wouldn't return because of it."
"3401 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/22/2012,$$,5,Sakaya Kitchen,"The vegan BBQ tofu special - brown rice, baby bok choy, and Miami's best Brussels sprouts - is incredible and unmatched by anywhere I've been since my last visit, including my own kitchen (though my pan-fried tofu is better). With sides of cucumber pickle (kirby cucumbers sliced in what I thought was sweet rice vinegar) and kimchi (better than what I got in the farmers' market at Fort Greene in Brooklyn): $13.90 before the tip. ,I ate here twice a week for about five months, and it was always a treat! You must try the fried shrimp. It's only the second place where the shrimp was so nicely fried that I could eat the shell, which can be really tasty. ,Props on the tunes! And shout-outs to Malika and Maylin and the entire team."

I ordered the ""vegan salad"" and their hummus, I know doesn't seem like much, but that meal was delicious!!  The salad was super fresh w baby arugula and the hummus and some of the best I've had around downtown Miami! But heads up, you can't add tip to your receipt once the meal arrives, you have to add it in advance. The deliverer was also extremely nice, and I owe him a few more bucks!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/28/2018,$$,5,ITAMAE,"Start off with a fresh tatami small plate, and work your way through the entire menu please - you won't be disappointed. Vegan or gluten allergies? No worries, Chef Fernando always got your back. My favorite dish is the Nikkei Bowl. Favorite sushi is the Lost in translation or the Sansho (creamy a.f.). Pro tip: pair it all with their japanese bubbly sodas."
"228 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",12/19/2016,$,5,Freshko Gourmet,"Delicious soy cappuccino. I subbed the mozzarella in the veggie panino with their balsamic vinegarette to veganize it, and it was super yummy. Great service. Reasonably prized. Perfect ambiance for a relaxed weekend brunch. No wait to be seated on a Sunday afternoon."
"228 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",8/21/2017,$,5,Freshko Gourmet,"This place is pretty cool the food was fresh and the service was okay being that there was only one server. The vegan salad is arugula, quinoa, tomatoes and cucumber was delicious."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/6/2015,$$,4,Burger & Beer Joint,"It's a decent place with a nice outdoor seating area, plenty of craft beer on tap and the staff is awesome. Of course, being Vegan I thought it would be difficult to find something here but they had a great Kale and Quinoa salad option. Only problem, they were out of Kale which I'm told happens often. If you're going to offer something that people will like as an option why be out of it since Kale is not plutonium. In other words, you can get it in every supermarket! They substituted with Spinach which was fine and the quinoa was awesome. I would definitely come back but they better not be out of Kale again."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/10/2018,$$,4,Burger & Beer Joint,"For vegans: There's a veggie burger (quinoa, beans, peppers), a quinoa & kale salad, and sweet potato fries/ skinny fries. They also have ""duck fat"" fries.... make sure to differentiate. The others in my group had plenty to eat, and enjoyed it. I had a nice glass of wine. The food was ready very fast and was reasonably priced."
"5600 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",3/20/2017,$$,5,Andiamo,"I was stuck on a field trip and a classmate recommended we sneak away for pizza. I was game since I'm vegan and didn't want to struggle to get vegan options in Little Haiti. Our server, Jennifer, was great. It's never fun to be the vegan asking about what's in the crust, etc. But Jennifer was nice and patient and checked things for me. I loved my pizza! So delicious! My non vegan classmate's pizza looked amazing! The other classmate got a salad which looked ok. Thank you Jennifer!"
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/3/2018,$,4,Spoleto,"Been to Spoleto at Dadeland Mall twice and loved the fresh options, generous portions,  homemade pasta and Flatbread. They make everything in front of you from scratch!  Food is definitely better than anything in the food court and much better prices than the larger restaurants.  For the most part a very committed young staff. Make sure you are very clear when you are specifying vegan or vegetarian."
"3000 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/4/2017,$$,5,Mabruk,"Amazing food,falafel was tasty and fresh! Cheaper than other places in the area. Hummus was delicious and so was taboule salad , great customer service our fave new place ,great option for vegans !!"
"3791 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33146",3/6/2018,$,4,El Rinconcito El Chele,"Good  (not great) food. Staff is a bit rude on the phone. If you do not speak Spanish they will hang up on you. They have a nice selection with options for vegetarian diets, vegan diets, and those with food allergies. Delivery time can take a while but over all decent for quick meal."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/23/2015,$$,5,Seasons 52,"One of the absolute BEST restaurants in South Miami. Everything here is perfect, the service, ambiance, and food are impeccable, and I am never disappointed. I took my parents here when they were visiting, and as huge foodies my dad said the veal was the best he has ever had, while the menu also has dishes for me (a vegan). The price is more than fair for the quality of meals, and you will NOT be disappointed. Season's 52 has my highest recommendation possible."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/15/2014,$$,5,Seasons 52,"This was the perfect location for my medical school graduation lunch. Service was great, food was delicious and we loved our experience. I would definitely go back and have another meal. I also liked the fact that they had a vegan menu for my Aunt and they are über accommodating for those with dietary needs."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/27/2015,$$,5,Seasons 52,"This is a great restaurant for those who care about healthy food and, especially, for vegetarians. Ask for the vegetarian menu. There's also a gluten-free menu, and a vegan menu -- you just have to ask. The options are extensive and include a Winter Vegetarian Tasting plate. Highlights from our meal today included the Warm Roasted Tomato Caprese Salad, the Roasted Basciani Farms Mushrooms, and the vegetarian soft taco. My partner had the trout and was very pleased. For dessert, our favorite was the Blueberries with Lemon Curd. I also recommend the cocktails -- Meyer Lemonade is very tasty. Our waiter, Camillo, was fantastic -- kind and attentive."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/15/2015,$$,3,Seasons 52,"Overall, Season's 52 was a solid experience.  My husband and I were looking for a vegetarian restaurant (in addition to my gluten and dairy allergies).  Their menu was a little bit inefficient since they have separate menus for gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan.  It was a bit overwhelming for me since a majority of the gluten-free menu was non-vegetarian.  However,  our server quickly found someone who could manage it and make recommendations.  We ordered the duo hummus for an appetizer, and I found the texture to be a little rough.  We had the warm beet salad, which was good and the vegetarian entree which was good as well and the restaurant accommodated my food allergies greatly in this meal.  ,If you go to the restaurant, i would recommend sitting in the main room or room adjoining to the bar.  We were put in an add-on room, which was freezing.  I complained several times, and 2 other tables near us complained about how cold it was too."
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/8/2016,$$,5,Seasons 52,"Delicious menu and great ambiance! They have food for everyone! Gluten sensitive, lactose free, dairy free, sodium friendly, vegan and vegetarian!! Plus they have 52 glasses of wine by the bottle!! Not to mention the service was amazing!"
"321 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/25/2017,$$,5,Seasons 52,"I've come to Seasons 52 a number of times and it does not cease to disappoint when it comes to the seasonal menu, the freshness of ingredients and the atmosphere are all great reasons to keep coming to seasons. And lets not forget their stuffed shrooms, which are absolutely a must try. I would come back and just order them and nothing else. I think their flatbreads are also pretty great and a surefire way to get in a good meal, however I wouldn't vouch for their brunch flatbreads. I would have been fine without the smoked salmon flatbread. I would come back again though, but would come back more so for the dinner menu. I would also recommend this restaurant for vegetarians and vegans, has pretty decent options. Their desserts are also a small but filling indulgence that doesn't make me feel too bad for breaking my diet."
"7378 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/1/2016,$$,5,Bangkok City Thai & Seafood Restaurant,"Bangkok City has been recommended to me by COUNTLESS people since I moved to the area about a month ago. I thought to myself, not everyone can be wrong about this place so I'll give it a try, even though I already have my usual Thai restaurant. I started with the basics - tom-coconut soup, pad thai, and red curry tofu, ALL were out of this world. The curry dishes in particular really blew me away. It's not just the cuisine here that's incredible, but the staff is so welcoming and nice that it almost makes me want to stay and eat there when I'm picking up a to-go order! As a vegan, I now eat here at least three times a week since I can get veggies and tofu made in so many different ways. Bangkok City is now my go-to spot for Thai or sushi."

I ordered the brown rice, cauliflower, eggplant lasagna, and the pumpkin spinach. EVERYTHING was delicious and flavorful. And the best part was how nice everyone was! In Miami it's so hard to find truly kind people who appreciate thank you's and are actually happy to have you in their establishment. We will definitely be going back very soon!! Thank you soooo much!! O and their fresh juices are made to order !"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/21/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Honestly, I was so turned off by vegan food before coming here. My friend encouraged me to come and try and have fallen in love with the food here since. Although it's small, the food is fresh and surprisingly DELICIOUS. I never feel bloated after eating here in comparison with so many other restaurants. This restaurant is as tasty and healthy as it gets. The owner is always there and so attentive. A little pricey but worth it."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/24/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Outstanding! Hands down, my favorite vegan restaurant. And I am a meat-eater! The staff is warm and makes you feel like family. They will have already run out of some of their best items around 1 p.m. so get there at 11 a.m. and you will get to try everything on their daily rotating menu (don't forget the soup!). They even have a ""cabana card"" for frequent eaters. I have eaten at some really good vegan restaurants, yet BOTH the taste and price of the food at Vegan & Juice are completely untouchable!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/26/2012,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I happen to be vegan, but I would still eat here even if I wasn't. The food is DELISH! The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. Also, they have an option to purchase meals for the week --which I want to try out here soon. The staff is inviting and kind.  The atmosphere is cozy and don't  leave without trying one of their vegan baked goods. Mmmm Mmmm Good!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/22/2013,$,5,Vegan & Juice,A vegan gem in the middle of Sweetwater of all places. The wraps are delicious and the chocolate blueberry cake is amazingly moist. Can't wait to go back to try more things!

The soups are tasty (and not heavily seasoned or salted); their quinoa is yummy and filling and their plantains / boniato or sweet potato mash are all sensational... They offer freshly made items every day and the veggies taste divine (always) cooked to perfection, never overpowered with lots of condiments. ,I have been doing their vegan diet in the evenings for just 2 weeks, and I feel more energetic, much less-bloated (no heavy salts nor fats in their food) and all-around healthier. ,Try their delicious dishes, you won't be sorry !!! ,(And the family that runs the biz could not be nicer or warmer with customers!)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/13/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I love this place! Their hot food is always different everyday, and all of their dishes, including the salads and wraps are DELICIOUS! They also sell juice that they make right in front of you. The people that work there are very friendly, and I couldn't ask for a better vegan and juice spot. Reasonably priced too!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/11/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"All vegan restaurants should be like this one, affordable and delicious! Great service too. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to eat something healthy and tasty. They even filter the water in which they cook with, something I do at home. The desserts are also a must when you visit this place. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/8/2012,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is a hole-in-the-wall kind of restaurant that happens to be vegan. It seems their ideals and meals are centered on the vegan lifestyle (which I love) but that is not the first thing that comes to mind when entering. Rather than taking the typical vegan-holier-than-thou approach, they take a ""welcome to my kitchen"" approach. ,The menu changes daily, has a hispanic tendency, and is always so so delicious. It's filling, comforting, and fresh. They make deliciously fresh juices and smoothies and have absolutely amazing desserts (sometimes raw too!). ,I'd recommend going no matter what your eating preferences, if you're into wholesome and warming foods. If you're vegan and you want to take a non-vegan to eat this is the place. My sig. O loves it and he's not vegan in any way."

This my favorite vegan spot in all of Miami and I'm lucky enough to live real close by them. It's cheap, flavorful and the variety is endless. Be careful though, their eggplant lasagna is vegetarian ( contains cheese) and they have vegetarian pizza too. The rest is vegan. My favorite dishes are the ceviche tofu, lentils, spinach taco, stuffed peppers. It goes on and on!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/27/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Hands down my favorite plant-based restaurant in Miami.  They serve Latin vegan food with unbelievable flavor they can make simple cabbage taste amazing.  They also have amazing homemade raw pies & cheesecakes available.  The best part:  a plate full of your choice of four dishes from their hot menu & a piece of pie is only $13!!

You often see the owner(s) bringing in the fresh produce and they are extremely hands on with their establishment. The place is small and tends to get very busy during lunch, so if you can go just before 12:00PM, you will be IN & OUT! I have yet to have some of the hot meal offerings, but the hummus wrap is great! Also, I have had the detox juice everytime I have visited! The place is also very clean & service is great!"

"5 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",3/3/2018,$$,4,MOMI Ramen,"This plAce was very authentic. I liked the place and the food was very tasteful. However when we got there we actually dis not know that the place had a cash only policy and prices where not as displayed here any ramen bowl was over 25$ I felt it deserves 3 $$$ signs. You are getting a decent bowl of food too but I just feel it is a but overpriced no matter how good the ramen is. One good thing is that the price i think includes a drink, we got a bottle of water as usual. I just believe the price is set very high it may be because of the location. However, food is delicious and very tasteful. Vegan option is a rockstar just remember to tell them you do not want the egg in your plate lol."
"7919 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/28/2018,$$,5,Cake’s Thai Kitchen,The greatest Thai food in Miami. They are SO NICE and have many vegan options. I highly recommend the eggplant chili miso tofu as well as the Chinese broccoli. The Tom Yum and Tom kha soup are both delicious. I could honestly eat this place for breakfast lunch and dinner it is so good!!  For an additional experience ago and it's a little bit hidden and worth it for delivery every single time

"301 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/15/2018,$$,5,Tap 42,"First timers. Prompt friendly hostess. Clean, cool, environment. Loud,but not rowdy. Danny was our waiter, very polite and did a great job! The decor is interesting. My husband and I ordered Golden Quinoa superfood salad (minus the feta), Grilled salmon Zen bowl, Asian Slaw and Roasted Brussel sprouts. All plates came out looking appetizing, each dish unique and full of flavor. Our favorite was easily the Asian Slaw! My husband is convinced that the grilled salmon would've been amazing on top of the Asian Slaw! This is a great spot if you want great service, delicious food and a loud atmosphere. We didn't drink, but maybe in the future. Thanks for a great experience, we consider ourselves a little difficult with food! In the future I'd love to see more Vegan options OTHER than salad!"

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/13/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Wow! Is all I have to say! Most people expect vegetarian/vegan food to be tasteless and dull yet in Vegan and Juice they are able to season all their foods to perfection. Their juices are made fresh in front of you and they use a masticating juice which retains all the fibre in the fruits and vegetables. I thoroughly enjoyed their lunch menu. I had whole grain rice, beans, veggie empanada and zucchini stuffed with tofu. To end on a good note my boyfriend and shared a banana cake which was also absolutely delicious. Will definitely come back!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/23/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"5 stars for quality and value. I was craving veggies, a good vegan mean, and wasn't ready to spend $15 on one. I yelped and ended finding this gem. The staff was friendly, told me about their menu and pointed out their hot bar, too. I opted for the Avocado Mambo wrap, and indeed it was a ""mambo"", HUGE. I saw the staff cut the veggies right in front of me, peeling the onion, opening the avocado, preparing this delicious vegan feast for me. For $6.96, you can't find a tastier, fresher wrap. I'll be coming back for another wrap and a fresh presses juice."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/15/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is absolutely excellent. Not enough good things I can say about it. The restaurant is impeccably clean and the food is mouthwateringly delicious. I am not vegan or vegetarian, I am a total meat eater, yet I love this place. I've had the cooked food, the wraps (avocado mambo) and their juices (abc and reggae) and everything has been amazing. It is family owned and you can tell they take pride in their product. The prices are excellent for the quality and freshness they provide. The location is sketchy, but it's sweetwater. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone, vegans to diehard meat eaters alike, you will not regret your visit."

But I have been flirting with the idea of reducing my meat intake, and Vegan & Juice has only sparked my curiosity even more! The menu changes daily. When I went last Saturday, I opted for a broccoli/carrot stir fry, malanga mash, and lentils. I don't know what these people do to their vegetables, but broccoli and carrots never tasted SO GOOD. Their juices are also perfectly made and very fresh, and the owners are very sweet. I can't wait to come back here to see what else I can catch on the menu!"

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/18/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan and Juice is truly a gem. Its simple and unpretentious location is no indication of it's amazing food. The owners create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere while providing excellent food options. ,This little restaurant is owned by a Dominican family. The infamous Dominican flavors are prominent in all their dishes (prepared daily). Not only is their menu healthy and varied, it's also incredibly affordable. The owners keep the restaurant extremely clean. And of course their menu VEGAN."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/7/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Very tasty and delicious food. The folks who run the place are very friendly. The food options are varied and all taste great. The juices are equally as good. The 39 dollar cantina is a great bargain if you frequent Vegan.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/4/2013,$,4,Vegan & Juice,Tucked away in a little shopping mall is this vegan spot. Everything looks fresh and the juices are made to order. It is a little on the expensive side (why is it that healthy food always is?) but now and again my body just needs some love. They serve hot lunch and big salads.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/20/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Where do I begin? This place is great. All vegan. All Latino deliciousness.

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/7/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Being vegan in Miami makes it pretty hard to eat out. Whenever I find a restaurant that caters to vegans it's a miracle. I had been dying to try out Vegan & Juice for a couple weeks until I was finally able to and it did not disappoint. I had the avocado mambo wrap and a leafy lemonade and my friend had the same wrap but the Mamey strawberry and papaya smoothie and all of it was phenomenal ! From the service to the food It was all great ! I was just a little disappointed that by the time o got there their hot food was already sold out. So if you're going for a warms lunch its first come first serve. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try it. If you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth though make sure to also get there before they sell out when I got there the only dessert left was the cinnamon roll and chocolate pie which was fantastic !
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/24/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Best vegan food in town!! Everything I tried in this place is delicious!! From the ""pastelon the platano"" to the eggplant lasagna the pumpkin puree, the key lime pie the leaf lemonade ... There are so many awesome foods but those are my favorites. The owners Francisco and Jennifer are super friendly .The place is not fancy but don't be fool by the simplicity. Vegan and juice is a first class food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/21/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Little whole in the wall place, but food was fresh and tasty. I liked my avocado wrap and my boyfriend his salad.  Raw vegancinamon roll was great. Closing eyes on the location part everything was good."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/30/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is great! Friendly staff and delicious food. Everything is fresh and delicious. Can't believe I've lived right around the corner to this place and never came. Will definitely be coming more often. I suggest trying the raw vegan cinnamon rolls, they're amazing!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/17/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I love this place mainly because it's vegan comfort food for me. It has that Latin feel I love and I haven't been disappointed yet on their selection of ready to eat meals. Also, their juices and smoothies are amazing and fresh but at a reasonable price. You also get a big portion of food like Latins tend to do haha. It's not the most appealing decoratively but I honestly don't care as long as the place is clean, which it is, and the food is good, which it definitely is."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/8/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Absolute gem for vegans in West Miami. The plate is the way to go for those who have an appetite for varieties. 4 sides of delicious vegan dishes. Lots of different options to choose from. Great juices too!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/28/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Most vegan restaurants in the area are really expensive and upscale, but this one is super laid back and also you cant beat the prices! Great food, great wraps :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/1/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place! I've been to various vegan/vegatarian restaurants and this is definitely one that stands out from them all. very affordable! i have paid 12/13 for a full plate of full with extremely limited amount of food, so for them to charge 8.50 its pretty amazing with various options, i was a very happy camper. The plate is filling, healthy and of great quality. It breaks the paradigm that people have of healthy food being only ""salad"", ""boring"" and ""lacking in flavor"". That is not the situation here. The staff is friendly which most definitely also adds to the experience overall. Hopefully the increase into becoming available in various locations. Very happy that its near where i live. I recommend it to anyone trying out vegan/vegetarian food. The owners had health and budget in mind when creating this and I'm very thankful they went through with their vision. Their product is fruitful."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/30/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Every single thing offered here is delicious and makes you feel amazing after, no matter how much you eat! And the staff is polite and helpful. Definitely check this place out. Go vegan!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/6/2012,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Ever walked into a restaurant and felt like family? Well that is the atmosphere once you walk into this Family runned business. All smiles and wholesome food. They have about eight different types of selections a day to make a meal, not including the pizza's, veggie wraps( my fav) and desserts(sometimes they run out fast. Also the epic freshly made juices and smoothies that aren't pulled out of a fridge and handed to you. They're made in front of you so no sketchy ingredients added Lol. Promise you won't regret having lunch here, its a great organic non guilty meal without the cardboard taste that some vegan meals can have they have a Hispanic kick to the food. Love it!,Here is there facebook page, they have updates on the menu: "
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/9/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I'm so glad that I found this place! The staff is warm and welcoming, the food is delicious and extremely close to FIU, and the menu is always changing. The owners are Dominican like myself, and even though I'm an ""aspiring"" Vegan - it was great to taste their food and feel like I was getting a home cooked Spanish meal without the meat. Get here early if you want to take advantage of their menu! I will be returning frequently."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/18/2015,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Very tasty vegan and vegetarian dishes, I had the quinoa and eggplant lasagna, very good and healthy and they have a $8 special! ,Great place for healthy eaters!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/13/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Out of every vegan place in Miami that changes up its food every day, this is the very best one and definitely worth checking out! The juice is phenomenal, of course, as well as the food. There has never been a time where I hadn't liked something that was being served but even if that does happen to you, the wraps are also worth a try! The curry wrap is my favorite. Also make sure to buy the desserts! I give the brownies to my non-vegan friends and they love them."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/9/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"The first time I came here, I tried a juice and it was delicious! I made sure I came back a second time to try a wrap and it was so good! I had the avocado mambo, it was filling and delicious. While I was there, i overheard that they have been open for 16 years. I definitely recommend this place. Even if you aren't vegan, it's worth a try. The wraps are amazing."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/29/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Extremely affordable vegan lunch restaurant. Food is delicious, always pleased with my experience. Sometimes the lasagna isnt vegan so it's always important to ask. Manager and staff are incredibly warm and helpful. Make sure you don't leave without trying at least one of their dessert!! Vegan or not, I strongly recommend this restaurant."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/16/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place gets 5 stars; not because it is some Miami high end cuisine or because it has specialty imported products. It doesn't embody either of those things. Vegan and Juice is family run community service. These people work hard to bring healthy vegan food to people that want or need it.,This also isn't the kind of place you go to just once. Rather it is the kind of place you continue to visit because you know deep down that their yummy delicious food somehow resonated with what your body was really craving."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/11/2014,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Few times I can find a vegan cafeteria in Miami worth re visiting. Vegan and juice is just that! Juices run for 3.75 (traditional apple, mango, orange,,carrot etc) with power juices for 4.50. My favorite is the fat burner (grapefruit apple pineapple). ,Wraps and sandwiches are avail within the 6-7 dollar range, all mostly a tofu based sandwich. I have also heard many good things about their pizza Thursdays (3$ a slice). ,As I'm sitting here writing this I have just consumed a yuca puff (filled with spinach mushrooms peppers and tomatoes), so good no time for a picture. Menu changes daily to reflect 8-10 specialty dishes. Special of the day includes 4 vegan sides all for a total of $8.50,They have a variety of vegan and gluten free deserts including various cakes, cupcakes, ice cream, cookies-even pastelitos ,Service is fast efficient and always friendly. Very comforting to see the same faces frequently who know what you want and how you want it. I cannot praise this place enough :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/5/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This place is awesome and the avocado wrap is as good as it sounds. I highly recommend this place for all you vegan needs.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/3/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Easily the best vegan restaurant in south florida! I come here whenever I get the chance. The avocado wrap is 2 die 4. The smoothies are perfectly sweet. The hot food is my favorite, you rarely see the same two dishes and they're all very creative, innovative meals. Staff is super friendly. The desserts are deliciously decadent. I've never had a problem with this place (aside from the fact that my inner environmentalist despises all the plastic and styrofoam used, but a vegan diet is pretty green so I suppose that cancels out the waste). Can't say enough great things about this place!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/25/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is fantastic. When you first enter, people are always hesitant to try the food because it's not your regular vegan food, but do it anyway! I love plantains so everything they do with them is always fantastic. Their juices are also delicious and nutritious. I always want beets in my juice as a pick me up and I love the reggae and recover. Their desserts are also to die for! My favorite is the tangerine, but they're all so good!! Be bold and check them out, you won't regret it!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/26/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is a godsend in this area. The food is incredibly delicious, I'm not even a big vegan eater. The juices and smoothies are so fresh and the prices are great."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/12/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Can I please have a moment of silence for this gem!!!!! Totally in love with this vegan restaurant. First time coming and for sure it would not be my last! Specially when it's located so close to the FIU engineer campus! I ordered the eggplant lasagna  with cabbage and sweet potato mashed! Perfect combination of colors, flavors, amounts! I also order a juice so I can complement my amazing lunch! If you're coming on a Saturday make sure you come before 4 since they do close earlier! I noticed that the a big portion of people that was siting around me where elder, which is good! That tells me that they feel at home eating here! Also a lot athletes come here!!. Even if you're not vegetarian, you should definitely come and try it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/27/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"So good!!! This little hole in the wall is one of the very best vegan places I've ever been to. It's super homey, and the customer service is on point. All the juices here are ,. Try the avocado wrap; it's heaven in wrap form. They also have a hot entree area, which I haven't tried yet, but it smells amazing. It's not the cheapest place, but considering all their ingredients are natural and wholesome, it's worth the price. Check them out!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/29/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Such a teeny tiny space that packs a punch of awesome vegan food! Everyday they have a new menu but they also have the their usual favorites. Did I mention it's all decently priced??? And they have pizza Wednesdays! Its first come first serve :) And it's conveniently located near FIU so I can pick up some food after class! Great, delicious, and healthy food!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/6/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Outstanding restaurant! Wonderful service, even more wonderful food. Very reasonable pricing. Never a disappointment when I come into Vegan and Juice! :)"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/18/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Excellent customer service. Plenty of flavors and options. Price is on point. Juices, wraps, sweeties and nice cooked food. It doesn't get better than this. This place is a good example that vegan food doesn't have to be boring or expensive. I wish I lived closer."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/14/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Went in with my mom to get some authentic vegan food which is hard in Miami. Had the veggie wrap and hummus pie which was fantastic. Also the spinach taqueria were incredible. Would come here again !!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/9/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is the best vegan spot in Miami! I am so thrilled I found this place on yelp. Everyone was amazing friendly and sweet and took care of us without any trouble. The homemade food that they have prepared is so delicious and their made to order juices are so refreshing. I can't wait to go back! ,It's small but full of love, amazing food, and great people."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/4/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Went for lunch for the first time today and simply stated, fantastic.  Food was delicious and pretty unique compared to other vegan restaurants.  Simple ordering, pick 4 of the 6 or so dishes, or a wrap, maybe add a juice, and you're set.  We had two of the entree pick 4, a juice, and a smoothie for about $30 so very affordable.  Price and selection plus the flavor, they've got all three.  Highly recommended, vegan or not."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/13/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"My very first experience with vegan meals, and boy was I pleasantly surprised! ,For starters the menu is updated daily and although it's a lil drive for me, it's totally worth it. ,I had the egg plant lasagna, malanga, mixed veggies and brown rice. ,Ok so the malanga was the most delicious thing I've ever had in my LIFE! The lasagna was great and so were the mixed veggies! ,If you come during the lunch time rush, be prepared to miss certain items on the menu, when they're out they are out.,Enjoy!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/22/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Fresh food made daily, lots of variety, and delicious!  I can't believe their desserts are vegan because they are decadent. I highly recommend this place."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/21/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is officially the best vegan food in Miami! Francisco and his crew are the hippest and healthiest Latin peeps I've ever encountered. The food is abundant, mouthwatering and super affordable. For less than $10 you can have a complete cooked meal with 4 items. They also make fresh wraps and salads cut and prepared right before your eyes. And let's not leave behind their signatures juices : Energy, Flu Blaster, Leafy Lemonade and a parade of other tantalizing combos. Dessert you said? Cupcakes, carrot cake, mandarin cake and cinnamon rolls are only a few of the sweet, animal free goodies you can choose from. ,If it's your first visit, go before noon or after 2 because lunch hour can be chaotically busy and you'll be waiting in line for a bit. They are also open on Saturdays. ,Enjoy this culinary gem!!!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/10/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This is probably my top three favorite food spots in Miami.  I cannot believe that the deserts are vegan because of how tasty they all are.  This is vegan food with a latin influence and boy is it delish.  The prices for the food being vegan are extremely reasonable.  Today I began a meal plan which Vegan & Juice offers that is five meals for about $8 each!  This is unheard of for quality, freshness, and tasty food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/17/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but delicious vegan food (I'm not even a vegan). It's family owned and the staff is so friendly. The hot food they serve daily is always fresh and tasty. They also make wraps, hummus, and smoothies - all great."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/20/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"A family owned Dominican vegan place located in a old mall in the 107 and flagler.  Simple place, small entrance and nothing fancy inside.  They offer salads, wraps and juices, but their true specialty is the vegan cantina. For around 10 usd you can choose four plates from the daily options prepared. The menu varies, and portions have good size. You can find options ranging from dsily soup, quinoa, vegetables, veggie lasagna, stuffed plantains, stuffed peppers, red beans and several other creations depending on the day.,If you are not in the mood for the cantina you can always ask for a special salad or wrap. Their mix of juices is excellent too. ,At lunch time place is always full. They have around 6 or 8 tables and a bar. The staff is friendly and attentive, the  locals that come here do so several days a week. The ambiance is good.  ,If you have any question about food or ingredients they will answer al your doubts and questions.  They sell also some natural supplements.,Great place for healthy food."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/26/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Best vegan place I have been to in Miami so far. Healthy food and a lot of choices. this a small family owned business but the food is homemade and delicious.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/1/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"My first time here and I had to comment on the amazing customer service, cleanliness, and the amazing vegan food. There's not much vegan places around in this area, but I am so happy I found this family owned vegan restaurant. The green juice I got was delicious and fresh and the food is made fresh everyday. It's as if I cooked it at home myself, the food is true Home Vegan cooking and you can't help but get a homie feel while eating it. Get the lunch special, it is super filling and great taste with every bite. I am coming back every time I have an opportunity for lunch from FIU."

I don't know much for vegan/vegetarian options so i OBVIOUSLY yelped my little heart away. just my luck, theres a vegan place (with good ratings) near by. ,we got there around 4pm and they had sold out on majority of the hot foods so all they had to offer were wraps. i had the avocado wrap and my friend had the hummus wrap with added quinoa. ,you can tell everything was fresh. i want to go back to try the hot food and some of the juices."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/4/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Delicious vegan food and juices! Super close to FIU and very affordable. I always get the avocado mambo wrap, it is delicious. All their food is amazing, i definitely recommend it."

Its family owned, when you walk in they greet you so warmly, you feel at home. The have the most delicious variety of vegan foods and desserts. They offer a daily special, for $9 you can pick 4 items from the menu, but not to worry...the menu changes every single day. Everything is delicious trust Me! Juices & Smoothies are great too, and if you want to customize your own, you definitely can. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/19/2015,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I've been coming here since I've been Vegan  (over 3 years) the food is delicious.. homemade cooking, juices, smoothies ugh I'm in heaven here! I always drop in at least for just a delicious slice of vegan pie for under $4!! ,The prices are amazing as well as the staff.. it feels like family everytime I go. Thanks for always being the best vegan restaurant I've come to ear at so far... nothing compares!! I love Vegan & Juice!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/11/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Even if your not vegetarian/vegan you will love this place!!! I'm a student at fiu and this is the most delicious, reasonably priced vegan food around. It's soooo nice to have a place make food with Latin flavors that I can eat! You can get a completa (4 choices of their daily specials that are constantly changing) for just 8 dollars. Their juices are amazing, my favorite is the leafy lemonade (juice of kale, lemon, and apple). From the fixed menu they have, I'm obsessed with the avocado mambo wrap SOOO FLAVORFUL. The food is healthy and leaves you feeling great. ,Everyone that works there is SO SWEET. They are all amazing and do a great job. Keep it up"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/1/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This has become my new favorite place in Miami ! I am so blessed that my boyfriend has moved 2 minutes away from this place I can just roll here or maybe even go twice a day whenever I want ... I usually get the hot bar food but I'm just a broke college student I swear everything looks delicious id buy it all if I could all at once and have a heavenly feast. Ive only tried the mamey, strawberry, pineapple (I think) smoothie but it was so good I can't stop getting it, it tastes like candy I'm scared to get anything else. They press the juices in front of you and make the salads and wraps in front of you in a bar style area. There's also limited seating in the back. Come early !!! It's first come first serve for hot food and trust me you don't want to miss the hot food. Options change daily so I'm never bored of going there. I actually find it super fun guessing what's gonna be on the menu that day, it's huge portions for extremely cheap. It's your favorite food from your Hispanic mom or dad but vegan style !! The staff is extremely friendly makes you feel like you just walked into a family's home ! I love seeing vegan places so packed even with so many non vegan people ! Great food like the one from here is what we need so people can see that it's possible to go vegan and eat good. Not the weird gross cold plant stuff I usually experience. I Will forever keep coming here"

"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/18/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I've been living near FIU for for a year now and Vegan and Juice is hands down my favorite vegan spot. It's tiny and cluttered inside, but I guess that can be typical of Miami - a bunch of tiny shops stuffed into one shopping center. The food is perfection - tastes like fresh, homemade, cruelty-free, real food. And I always get a juice - 5 bucks is nothing for a fresh juice that they make right there in front of you. The styrofoam cup they're served in isn't the cutest, but at least it's not plastic so I guess it's better for the environment this way. The empanadas are good but different, don't expect the typical fried dough, it's more bready and baked it seems? Still tasty, though. Everything is good, just go here."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/14/2017,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"I'm not vegan but I really wanted to try this place out since I live close by. The reviews were phenomenal. I arrived past 3 and by that time most of the Today's special menu was gone with about 3 things left. I opted for the avocado wrap that everyone raves about. It's good and tasty. Very fresh. I probably would give this place another shot (much earlier) for their special of the day foods. The staff is very friendly. Family run business which is nice. ,Value wise I think it's okay. It's a little on the pricey side. Almost $8 for the wrap. I get I'm paying for quality but it is veggies..."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/29/2016,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"Love this place! I've been trying to reduce my overall meat intake and dedicating two days of the week to be fully plant based and that's what led me to look for this place. This is an all natural, all organic, plant-based, vegan friendly, vegetarian friendly whole in the wall. Every morning they make lots of different dishes and they run out super quick! Everything is fresh and home made. If you don't get there early enough they have a regular menu filled with delicious wraps, salads, smoothies, and juices. ,The ambiance isn't the nicest but the staff and service make up for it. They are all extremely attentive and so warm and welcoming. I really feel at home here. Best of all are the prices!! So worth it, I wouldn't say it's cheap but you definitely get your money's worth and it for sure is less expensive than other vegan juice bars.,I had the curry tofu wrap with hummus and the ABC juice (Apple, Beets, Carrots). I also tried a veggie empanada which was also great. ,I also love the fact that they aren't stingy!! The portions are very filling."

Honey is stolen from bees..,Other than that, im vegan myself and its so amazing that they have this hidden gem. Its really hard to find vegan places in Miami, this is the first ive seen that is totally vegan. i had the Avocado Tofurkey wrap and it was AMAZING. especially the pink sauce they add!!! Also had a smoothie, really natural and refreshing. Super friendly staff! Will DEFINTELY GO BACK. RECOMMEND"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/22/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan food is YUMMY.,The reluctant meat-lover in me finally visited Vegan & Juice after having heard great things about it. Thanks to this place, the meat-lover in me has now become open to vegan options.,This place is a family-run whole-in-the-wall....and it's absolutely wonderful. You'll be able to choose from hot foods and a variety of wraps and a few other options. Note: a lot of the hot food runs out by mid/late afternoon. On my visit, I arrived at 3pm, so most of the hot food was gone. Regardless, I tried what was left.,An awesome thing is that they let you sample the hot foods. I ordered two servings of what was left because the sample blew me away. To be honest, even though the employee repeated the name of this dish several times to me, I still don't know what it's called. Sorry fellow yelpers - but point is: it was hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious!,I also tried my boyfriend's avocado mambo wrap. I was ultra-reluctant about trying the wrap because I was ultra-doubtful that a wrap could taste good without any meat. I was wrong; it was downright delicious.,The food got me full and I felt incredibly satisfied after. Service was fantastic and prices were decent. I will absolutely undoubtedly be back."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",8/2/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"A complete twist on what you consider a savory lunch spot with a vegan twist. From Malanga Pastelon to a huge variety of freshly squeezed juices and wraps- this place proves that vegan can indeed be indulgent while not breaking the bank. It's located in a strip mall right by FIU & I suggest getting here early because once they run out if an item- they are out of it for the day. Check their Instagram for their daily menu which is released at around 11am. I shared the daily special which was a vegan pastelon, okra, and a garbanzo dish along with the avocado mambo wrap (I added tofu). I decided to get the grape juice which blew my mind! Its just pure grapes ! There's no filler! It tasted like heaven ! The Dominicans running this got it down pact and while there might be a wait to be served, your body will thank you in every way. Having vegan options allows your body to breathe from all the toxins we invest daily. I'm so happy I found this place. Oh, and the price beats all those hipster spots that serve you half the portion and charge you double the price. Try to avoid the lunch crowd and come a bit early. Please get the grape juice, you'll be glad you did!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",9/5/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,I am not a Vegan but i wanted to try something different and healthy and Man did i make a great choice. The staff was so welcoming and the food was so delicious. i would definitely come back again.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/8/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Everything is so yummy that I forget that it is vegan (not that it's a bad thing). The point is, anyone can really enjoy the food here and it is very affordable. ,I guess people think that eating healthy and more organic has to be expensive. Not the case here. For under $10 I have myself a super delicious and nutritious lunch. I have been here a few times during lunch, and just wish it was a bit closer. ,The lunch special allows you to choose 4 items from their daily specials. Today I had the quinoa, beans, tofu and baked sweet potato tart. It was all very yummy and filled me up real quick. I ordered a zucchini cake to-go (for my afternoon snack). ,They are pretty busy, but the line moves quick because the foods are prepared in a buffet style where the ladies serve you from. A lot of people come in and sit by the counter bar or towards the back where they have small tables up to 4 people. Hope to be back soon!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/1/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Amazing authentic Caribbean vegan food with a green juice and smoothy bar! they run out of food every day. It's that good! Had the special of the day. Asked for a second meal to go for dinner later . It's that good !
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/18/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"What a great Yelp find in Miami! Vegan yummy food, and you don't have to be vegan to enjoy. The juices are delicious and super fresh. The wrap and salad also with super fresh veggies and lots of flavor. The strawberry vegan cake was the cherry on top :) the place is not pretty and it's in a non pretty shopping but it's great and totally worth visiting.( Also very inexpensive )"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/9/2017,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Please get non-styrofoam containers! I love the food here. It's so nice to find something healthy even though I'm not Vegan.  But it disappointing to find place especially a vegan place that uses styrofoam.,I've had the tofurkey wraps and got the $8.50 hot plate that had 4 items. The okra, zucchini boats, spinach wrap and yucca pastel were amazing. Very flavorful!,The banana cake was good, not amazing though"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/10/2017,$,3,Vegan & Juice,"It's hard for me to review a place like Vegan & Juice because I'm not Vegan, and I generally don't like Vegan food, so anyone reading this review should keep this in mind.,Vegan & Juice is a spot tucked into the shopping plaza next to La Nonna and Spice N' Curry, it's a cafeteria-style setup with some dining, where upon entering, there's a line to where you can choose 1 of about 8 different ""dishes"", some of which are sides, and others which seem more like a meal. These are all vegan dishes. Today, they had items like Basmati Rice (good), Yucca, Eggplant Parmesan, and a Pepper stuffed with some vegetables. I enjoyed the Basmati rice, it was good. The Yucca was also good, but I did not enjoy the flavors of the Eggplant Parmesan or the stuffed peppers. ,The meal was around $8 for my food, which is above average for lunch prices, but probably pretty cheap for vegan food. They offer some dessert options, but they're typical restaurant dessert prices of around $4-$5. I find this place intriguing because it's something that the area doesn't offer, and it appeals to a certain demographic. I can't say I enjoyed it, or I was enticed to ever come here again, because it doesn't appeal to me. It might appeal to me better if there were ""traditional"" food options, just prepared in a vegan way, but this place is not it. This place was very busy, so I'm sure that the vegans do enjoy this spot. There's no ""service"" here per say, because it's just the person giving you your food. Overall, decent.,3*"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/27/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan food with sazón! These Dominican ladies call me mami and feed me the most flavorful veggies I've ever had! For $8.99 you get ""the meal of the day"" which includes 4 sides of your choice, all made fresh that day with that Dominican love. And for me, it's enough for two meals. The eggplant lasagna, my word!!! And the large fresh juices for just $5. Let's not forget the vegan gluten free desserts. It's like homemade food made my momma for a great price! The only thing...the styrofoam kills me. Plastic, something recyclable, anything but styrofoam. I think it's just a matter of the customers asking them to transition...so help me out?! But the food and service is just YUM!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/5/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my year of being vegan. Their food tasted like home cooked food & the service was the epitome of Hispanic excellence and a unique welcoming ambiance.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/11/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Heard about this place from @thehappyveganBaker and decided to give it a try.,Had no idea we were going to be in for such a treat. ,My daughter and I  had the avocado mambo wrap a veggy tofurky empanada with a leafy lemonade it was amazing!!! The food was so tasty. One of my best vegan experiences ever! ,Extensive menu! Great prices too . I'm a happy customer.,We are non-vegans  loved it would definitely be coming back"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/25/2016,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan & Juice is a small local eatery. They have all fresh and vegan food, wraps, juices, smoothies and desserts that will blow your taste buds.,The tiny restaurant has been in place for 16 years. The main treat here is their food canton that is sold out after lunch (~2pm). Now, don't let that stop you from coming. Their wraps are huge, and I've only tried their Avocado Mamabo which rocks. Now, if you are really here to be blown away - go ahead and order a slice of carrot cake. You'll never think that Publix one was any good! ,Their banana and strawberry smoothies are delicious, and their watermelon juice the bomb. I go to school at FIU Engineering, just across the street, and enjoy coming here often and seeing all of the familiar faces. Their customer service is always friendly and stellar!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",12/13/2017,$,4,Vegan & Juice,"First let me say I am not a vegan- however this place is a game changer. I (if you have noticed in my reviews) just like trying a lot of different things. ,I really found this place good. I am not sure how you give 1/2 stars but this place is a strong 4.5. It's a small establishment and the choice of items is limited- so I can only say more choices and a more descriptive way to know what is available. ,I'm a risk taker, but others want to see the choice and not have to ask about everything available. ,Great service and patience with a new customer. The beets, broccoli, potato dish- all were excellent. Even if I can't tell you the names of everything i ate. ,Give it a try."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/25/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Delicious food and I'm not a big fan of vegan food. I like that it's family owned and they're super nice. They've even helped my family take things to the car before when their hands were full.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/14/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"This place is a gem. Tried the avocado wrap with hummus and it was absolutely delicious. The fat burner juice which consisted of apple, pineapple and grapefruit, amazing! The hot food looked even better and all vegan which is obviously a bonus. I highly recommended, I am definitely coming back."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/10/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Delicious vegan food. Staff super friendly. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely come back
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/27/2017,$$,4,LOUI,"Food is very good! Ambiance is cozy and family oriented but hip. Great wine selection and many veggie and vegan options, but all the meats/poultry/fish as well. Has an artsy feel with beautiful paintings,, they offer wine and painting nights one Tuesday a month,,, loved it! Great for family lunch/dinner or even for a romantic date, don't think it twice!"
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/12/2016,$$,4,LOUI,"Loui offers a great mix of Italian and American food in a cozy, rustic location on Miracle Mile.  I the food to be generous and the taste to be above average.  I had a statement from a coworker that the food was served a bit on the cold side.  Nothing that should ruin it for you.  When I went the restaurant was pretty much empty so it was a little surprising to see a slow down in service toward the end of the meal.  Also keep in mind that the vegan risotto may not be available on Mondays.  I love the quinoa salad and the porcini mushroom risotto.  Didn't make it to dessert but I'm sure they are wonderful.  It's a relatively new face in the Coral Gables/Miracle Mile scene and certainly deserves a chance."
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/22/2017,$$,5,LOUI,"Great place for a relaxing afternoon or evening. We ate the vegan risotto, salmon tartar, and quinoa salad. All I can say is DELICIOUS! Great service and ambiance. Beautifully decorated. Great place to celebrate specially occasions as well. A definite Must Try!"
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/12/2017,$$,4,LOUI,"Stopped by with a group of 10 people. Service was prompt, owner was attentive to our needs. Tasted several items on the menu including the mushroom risotto, pesto linguine, and vegan ceviche. Decent, but not the best. Risotto was a bit on the bland side, linguine needed a bit more pesto, and the vegan ceviche was a bit overpriced for what you're getting. ,Overall, a quaint little spot with a solid wine list and a menu that will appeal to most. Nicely decorated, would make a great place for date night."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/17/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"God bless this place. A hidden gem in Miami, I'd come to eat here once because I had a sensitive stomach that day and was recovering from the flu. I'm not vegan, but I figured if any place was going to have healthy food that was good for me this was a good fit. Today was my second visit a year later and the quality has not changed. It's still a friendly, warm atmosphere where customers know the staff and each other.,I got the 4 sides lunch special. It was filling and DELICIOUS! The place advertises itself as Vegan Latin Cuisine, and that's exactly what it delivers. It tastes like your or your friends Mami made it. The menu is creative and whatever sides you get compliment each other.,Latin restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city, but this is the first that is designed with a meatless menu. The juice bar is also out of this world. Good places like this are an endangered breed in this city - this is not a place to be missed."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/16/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I am in no way a vegan but if all vegan food tasted like this I could be. This place is so bomb. I decided to try it because it is close to my job and the yelp reviews were great. Every day they have different specials and everything I've tried is outstanding (lentil soup, okra, mushrooms, squash, red beans, salad). The lunch is about $8 and you can choose any 4 items including any of their hot specials, side salad or guacamole. Everything has wonderful flavor, the service is great and friendly and it is reasonably priced- especially for vegan food. I recommend to get there early because the two times I've been around 1:30 pm they are already sold out of some of their specials. ,Highly recommend- vegan or not!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/28/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Who knew vegan food could be so yummy? With generous portion sizes for only $8 you can get 1 meal that will last you for lunch and dinner. Better than any delivery meal plan out there. Soups here are delicious, my favorite is the pumpkin! ,Staff here are friendly,  you can dine in at the juice bar or at a table. The restaurant is pretty small and can get busy. ,If you want to get started on a healthy eating plan, this is a great economical way to do it!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/15/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"The first time I wandered in here I looked at the menu and left without anything. Lets face it for all the non super healthy eaters out there like myself - vegan food doesn't sound or sometimes look the most appetizing. ,Fast forward a few months this is my go to spot for healthy, tasty lunch. You can order fresh juices, a number of different wraps, soups and there's a daily lunch buffet too - thats my go to. You can choose 4 different dishes for under $9.00. ,What a deal for the quality of food you get. ,Love this place."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/24/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Best place to hit up for a juice if you don't have a juicer, when you need brain food and recharge your human body, GET THE AVOCADO MAMBO WRAP with no humus... Oh my lord... SOOOOO GOOD. You will easily spend $30 in there, but if you can splurge do it, if you can't stick to the wrap and a juice, a juice can be between 4- 6 bucks (small- large). The small salad is completely worth it and the green juice is an amazing combo of all you need in nutrient, the vegan brownie is a must!  Yes you might have to wait, for the demand is larger then the amount of people there are in taking orders and working blenders etc, none the less worth the wait, also be aware that it is a small hole in the wall, with a lot of charm, quick tip you can always call in and order for the hot food ahead of time and pick up, the food goes quick, be there by 11 a.m. or miss out lol selections get fewer."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/31/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,By far one of the BEST vegan places I've been to! The food was super yummy!!!! Highly recommend!
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/2/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Vegan & Juice is awesome and is near the top of my list of places to eat in Miami. While it may be tempting to pre-judge vegan food as tasteless, this is not the case at Vegan & Juice. Also, I'm not a vegan.,The first time I came here, I was blown away by how good vegan food could be because I like pretty much all the food that I've tried here which can change from day to day. Even their daily soups are great. Taste, seasoning, texture.. all on point especially for vegan food. I also like their wraps such as the Avocado Mambo Wrap or the Veggie Tofurky Wrap. Everything is fresh and made to order. If you come at the right time, you can see the owner hauling in all of the produce daily.,The juices are freshly blended right in front of you. They have a wide variety of blended and non-blended juices to choose from. I usually get the Flu Blaster which has real ginger in it and then add some strawberries to it.,The service here at Vegan and Juice is always great. Feels like family. They recognize you on your repeat visits. One lady in particular always welcomes me out loud with open arms which always makes my day. Last time, she mixed me up with some other Asian guy, but it's all good and I don't blame her. We all look alike.,The prices are reasonable. When I visit Vegan & Juice with my gf, we usually order a full meal, a wrap, a soup, and 2 juices and the bill usually comes out to the mid $30 range which is hard to beat. They also don't expect any tips when they run your credit card. Does that mean you should not tip?? Of course not!,My only issue with Vegan & Juice is that I don't live closer to it because I could eat here every day."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",6/1/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Picture this: You stumble upon a shopping center with a combination of the most random restaurants, a bank, and a banquet hall. You walk into Vegan and Juice and are greeted by friendly faces (bilingual btw), half the restaurant is the seating area the other half if the serving area. It is mostly vegan, there are some items you can get like honey in a smoothie or cheese on an eggplant lasagna, BUT the servers always ask you so if you are vegan do not fear! Very respectful and kind staff! Incredible carrot cupcakes and brownies, taste like heaven! Also, if you're sick they have a special ginger lemon Drink that works miracles. I love this place, I go often, and I'm never disappointed by the quality of food. I recommend the lunch special and replacing one of the sides with a soup for the best value! Trust me, the soup is always great so you're not missing out!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/7/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"What's not to love about this place!? It's run by a very nice Dominican family so you know the food is bomb. Everything from their juices, smoothies, wraps, soups, salads, home style comfort vegan food and desserts are all EXCELLENT. You can't go wrong when you eat here. Everyone I've brought always enjoys their food. ,I suggest that you come early if you want in on the hot bar cooked food because they start running short by noon (they open at 10am, Monday - Saturday). They post their daily menu options on their Instagram (@veganandjuice) so you can call ahead and order or just drop in and order in person. They occasionally have some non-vegan dishes that includes regular cheese so be sure to ask. ,All in all, I love this little gem that's tucked away in Sweetwater and try to come as often as I can. I highly recommend you check it out if you haven't already."
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/27/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"I absolutely loved my experience here!!! It was my first time, and the woman who was serving the hot meals, was so nice, helpful, and welcoming. I had their yellow lentils suffle, spinach and tofo, squash and carrot mix, and the green plantain puff. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. I just started getting into vegan meals and this food honestly changed my perspective on how creative you can get with plant based foods. The staff had a smile on their faces, welcomed me in, and it was an overall amazing atmosphere. ,See you soon Vegan & Juice!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/17/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,This is my favorite vegan spot ever! The food & smoothies are phenomenal. I go to FIU & this little spot is convenient for me to have lunch. I enjoy coming here when I get the chance. The staff is wonderful & very welcoming. They treat all their customers like family. I'm so happy to have found this place & will forever keep coming back.
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/30/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,"Filling, delicious, cheap, healthy, and home-made! I love every visit I make to this place because they have new dishes everyday. The very sweet Dominican family knows how to make vegan food with flavor. I have been here many times for the hot meals, but make sure you come or order before 1:30pm! That's around when the warm, fresh dishes run out. My favorites are the eggplant lasagna, spinach tacos, zucchini / squash, and any of their souffles. ,If you're craving a dessert while you're there, their vegan key lime pie makes me melt whenever I order it. It has a distinct coconut flavor and you can't go wrong with it. I believe they are opening a new location soon in Doral, so I can't wait to see what they start doing there too!"
"115 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/5/2018,$,5,Vegan & Juice,Awesome food and great fruit drinks. Small place but a gem. You have to try especially if you are a vegan.  The hot vegan food is amazing. Staff is so friendly. It's like having a family meal.
"271 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/12/2017,$$,5,LOUI,"Excellent food. VEGAN OPTIONS MUCH APPRECIATED!! And they are on seamless! This place is a lifesaver for delivering a gorgeous and delicious meal for my family and me. Our group included both plant-based to animal-based eaters and were all able to order and enjoy what we needed. They have delicious healthy risottos and burgers made from vegetables--as well as risottos and burgers made from sea animals and cows, if eating animals is your thing. An extra star for how lovingly the meal was packed.  Everything clearly labeled with little drawings and everything. Thanks to them!  A beautiful meal."
"1104 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/22/2017,$$,5,Yuzi Yakitori,"This was our first time in Miami, and we found this restaurant on Yelp.  The food is just terrific, and the service was excellent.

"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",7/18/2017,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Yes. Yum. Thank you, Ghee, for bringing conscientious diversity to Miami. Farm fresh, local food, organic and sustainable wines, and plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free offerings. This night started with attentive service from Gabriel at the bar. His suggestions and explanations unfolded the menu for my husband and I like the petals on a lotus. The night ended with a delicious cake by pastry chef Alex, whose palette is clearly something exceptional. Everything in between was flawless. We will be back. ,...and we came back. Sooo yummy again. We had more yummy veggie offerings while our friends raved about the lamb. Service and food were immaculate -again. Alex (pastry chef) recognized us from a couple nights ago and personally greeted us. This time dessert was the date cake and Benin a cake. ***spoiler alert: these desserts will give you cravings and cause you to return."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",4/8/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Farm to table food. Delicious!  Have been there a few times and the food has always been excellent. The service is fantastic. The menu denotes gluten free, vegan and vegetarian choices."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",2/22/2018,$$,4,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"We came on a busy Saturday evening, and snagged the last two chairs at the bar (no reservation needed there!) between two friendly groups who were happy to adjust a bit so we could all have our elbow space. The decor is lovely, and while the restaurant was loud, everyone was friendly and welcoming. The menu is also incredibly GF and vegan friendly, so we have an immediate go-to when our dietarily restricted friends come to visit!,Truly great service from Gabriel this past weekend. We would visit again and sit at the bar just so we could say hi. The SO is a chatter, so I think he liked having someone to talk it up with. Gabriel had great suggestions for us based on what was fresh from their Homestead farm, and when he heard I appreciated a hearty spice, he brought by a sample of their house marinated chiles to try. Our waters were kept filled, and we had a great view of the chefs at work. To note, dishes came out at an interesting pace (we got there and ordered after our neighbors and received literally every dish before they did).,Now for the food - it was all worth a try, though some plates were a bit of a letdown in terms of flavor and straight Americanized-fusion nonsense. Let's start with my least favorite of the night - the ghost pepper-cheesy naan. Just don't get it. One, if you ordered it for any spice flavor, there is none. It's straight up just damp, cheesy naan. Paired with my curry, it was not the right flavor or texture. I stole my SO's garlic naan instead - much better and perfectly garlicky as one would expect.,Then the papadum. Normally a salty, crispy starter that you would dip in a sweet chutney (or for me, the spicy sauce), it was placed in front of us fully topped like a giant nacho. A tomato salsa-like chutney was all you could see. And taste. And that's just...not what I wanted or expected. But I still ate it.,And the pork belly vindaloo. If there's a vindaloo or a jalfrezi, no matter what else is on the menu, that's going in my belly - at any Indian restaurant or home. Especially one that is inspired by Western Indian dishes. Here, while the pork belly was generous, the flavor was missing something special. Also, a noticeable lack of fiery kick despite there being scotch bonnets on the ingredient list. (No substitutions or additions on the curries, as they are made the day of and stewed for hours).,After all my negativity, you must be wondering where the four stars come from (or maybe not). The lamb shank biryani was a redeemer. Flavorful, generous, a pomegranate crunch, and just all around wonderful. We would order it again without a doubt. The SO also had the grilled sweet corn and the poriyal (again, fresh from the farm). It was incredible how the chefs were able to transform simple ingredients like lima beans and lentils into something so flavorful and filling.,In the end, Ghee really shines with their simple and farm-to-table dishes. I'm ready to order one of every vegetable dish on the menu, and hesitate on the curries. What I'm most excited about is if/when they start hosting like, giant family dinners on their production farm. That would be a big treat to see just where my dinner came from."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/22/2012,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is fantastic! They have lots of vegetarian and some vegan options which is sometimes hard to find. The ambiance of this little cafe was so zen; a perfect lunch spot after a crazy morning. I had the homemade hummus, lentil soup and the veggie quesadilla. All were delicious and came out pretty quickly for this hungry girl. Definitely a place to check out!"
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",6/23/2018,$$,3,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Ambience is great, in Miami's Design District. Food is served as shareable. While prices off the menu look cheap, consider yourself warned that portions are small. For an Indian restaurant, I was surprised to find that there weren't that many well rounded options here in terms of protein for us vegans. Most likely won't be back."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/6/2014,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"The pizza is great and delicious. The meatballs are great also. The place is not big, but have space indoor and outdoor. The problem is that the waitress service isnt that good, they are very slow. They have little selection of craft beer, if you like the Ale, try the Monk in the trunk. Also they have pizza for vegan and vegetarian people. Overall is a good place for lunch, but if you are short of time, ask for delivery."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/6/2013,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I've been to Lemoni Café twice and had a wonderful experience both times. The food and service were excellent. The place itself is small but very cute and cozy. It's perfect for an outing with a group of friends or a date night with your significant other. My first visit I ordered the special of the day which was steak with pesto and mashed potatoes; it was delicious! My second visit I ordered the soup of the day (Lentil) and a smoked salmon panini; both were very tasty. One thing I admire about Lemoni Café is their extensive menu and the fact that they offer a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. The food is excellent and the prices are extremely reasonable/affordable. The service is both friendly and very attentive. I highly recommend Lemoni Cafe, I also recommend Lemoni Pizzeria which is right next door. If you happen to be near Midtown/Wynwood/Design District/Buena Vista you should definitely check out Lemoni."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/5/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"We finally made it out to Lemoni!! It was the husbands idea too, although I've had this little gem bookmarked for years. We arrived on a Sunday at around 5:15pm,  glanced the very extensive menu, and ordered a bottle of wine (it had been a long day). Another couple came in a few minutes after us and asked at what time the place closed and out waiter tells them 6pm as he was pouring my wine. I thought we were going to be rushed out of there, but none at all. The service continued to be as great as if we had arrived hours before closing. Now the food...I am a diehard sandwich lover. I can live off sandwiches for the rest of my life. This place is a panini/sandwich lovers mecca. Lots to choose from, even vegan/veggie options if thats your thing. My husband got his inner vegan on with a black bean burger panini which he devoured. You could tell that the patty was fresh and homemade b/c it had beans coming out of it..I on the other hand ordered the meatball parm sandwich which paired delectably with the Malbec. The meatballs were the perfect size and also fresh tasting.  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other panini options. My advice to any yelpers out there is to remember they close early, 6pm on Sundays. They did turn away a few patrons that arrived at 5 till, so they do mean business!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/20/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Great place! The vegan plate was an amazing option with the most delicious vegan coconut cutlets served with vegan mozarella.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/4/2015,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"Good decor, many vegan options and perfect for a low key first date"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/16/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"INCREDIBLE!!! I cannot believe this is my first time coming here, and I'm so glad I did because this is now my new favorite little cafe here in Miami. You will not be disappointed by the vegan options. In fact, I dare say it's one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had in Miami! I had the vegan cutlet sandwich with a side salad and a smoothie. AMAZING! Amazing service, casual and quaint ambiance, and an overwhelming large selection of vegan options. I'm definitely a fan and will be returning soon!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/19/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Best food!!! Omg!! If you are vegan or vegetarian this place is over the top !! We had soo many choices..we for sure over ordered..everything was amazing..we had several salads..soup ..hummus ..sandwich which was made of coconut heaven..tiny place!! Excellent service..reasonable prices..for sure coming back
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/15/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place never fails. Food and service is ALWAYS GREAT! Vegan options, must try paninis!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/12/2014,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is pretty awesome so far.  Great menu, service has been good, and food has been great.  Plan on returning many times.  The Sunday meatball parm is very good.  They even have multiple vegan options."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/1/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Love dining at Lemoni Cafe! Hands down the best service in Miami. The servers treat you like family and always have a sense of calm even when they get quite busy. The food is outstanding as well, their menu is extensive and has options for everyone omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan alike. I myself am vegan and highly recommend the coconut breaded tofu panini with 3 bean salad, but everything I've tried in the last 4 years has been excellent!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/28/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Excellent excellent! The staff was really friendly and knowledgeable about vegan food! I had a Veggie Quesadilla that was extremely tasty! With a vegan mozzarella that tasted better then regular mozzarella. Def recommend!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/14/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"This place deserves a 5 simply because of how unique the restaurant is as a whole. My cousin was living in Midtown for some time, and we would always order from this cafe. The food was always fresh but the wait sometimes was a bit long. Although I must admit, I am a fond advocate that if the food is amazing, I will wait a bit more time for an amazing meal. I would always order the chicken salad!!! So much flavor! Everything is spectacular! They have a huge selection for vegan and vegetarians which is the best!!! Since I don't eat that much meat! I promise you, this place will not disappoint! They know what they are doing."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/10/2014,$$,3,Lemoni Cafe,"I've only ever had food delivered from here through the Yelp app, which uses Eat24 to execute the order. I was very pleased to find they have vegan/vegetarian options right on their menu, so I didn't have to cobble a meal from side dishes like I'm used to doing as a non-cooking vegan!,I chose the Veggie Lover's Panini which was bursting with roasted vegetables, including peppers, mushrooms and eggplant. My fault for forgetting to tell them no cheese, but I was starting to forget (and miss!) the taste of the gooey melted Provolone anyway. I picked chips for the free side of chips or greens, and it came with a small bag of plain Lay's.,Including a $2 delivery fee, my order came out to $11.63 before tip. Considering they were willing to trek all the way to me at The Venetia, I definitely got the better end of that bargain. Great meal, and would order from or visit again!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/20/2015,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"A hidden gem! Casual and eclectic atmosphere, this place looks like it easily doubles as a quirky cafe and lowkey lunch or dinner spot. A huge range of food options, especially for dinner. And many vegetarian/vegan, a big plus. But most importantly, everything my table ordered was excellent. Even something as simple as a chicken wrap was filled with unique and delicious flavors. Other favorites: Hummus, Tabbouleh, Coconut breaded vegan cutlets.,Definitely returning often."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/18/2016,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Great little place with big flavor and vegan options. The house specials that include vegan meatballs and a tofu caprese salad are generous and serious supreme gourmet. They could sell their vegan Parmesan cheese and make a fortune. Bella. I hope that they can expand to the empty retail space next door,"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/27/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"The food is good, the atmosphere is even better! A little hole in the wall in Miami's Mimo District, Lemoni Café really transports you to a little chic European café. And they have amazing vegan options!,Ambiance: I usually start off with food, but this place is really all about the ambiance! The absolute perfect date night spot, especially for a first date (and it's near Wynwood so if you're feeling each other make your way to one of the breweries!). There's so much character in the decor, the colors very rich and warm so you just feel so at ease and comfortable. It's tiny and just down to earth! ,Food: I really liked the food! They have an extensive menu with everything from sandwiches to salads to vegan entrees! Perfect place for vegans & non-vegan friends to come because there is something for everyone! I ordered the Vegan Platter and Jesus! Food for 3 meals easily! Came with quinoa, whole wheat pita, sautéed veggies, hummus, VEGAN MOZZARELLA, strawberries with mint, and coconut meat breaded with oatmeal. Absolutely freaking delicious and super filling! I couldn't get over the vegan mozzarella. My date ordered the chicken quesadilla and he said it was really good too! They don't have a large wine or beer menu, but they have some great craft beers including Dead Guy Rogue which is my absolute favorite! I really wanted their vegan cookies, but they were out. Next door they have a pizzeria with vegan pizza, can't wait to try that!,Overall, cute, quaint, good food, large menu selection, limited wine & beer, and vegan deliciousness! Highly recommend this place for a simple dinner date."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2016,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Cute lil cafe in Midtown, vintage decor and vegan friendly menu! I tried their avocado and sundried tomato pannini with vegan mozzarella cheese and a side salad...wow! this sandwich was soo good and filling! I couldn't finish it all so took the other half home. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The space is very quaint and inviting. I will def be going back to try more of the items on their menu."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/2/2014,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I heard Lemoni Cafe have some vegan options, so after taking my car to have their oil change, I decided to stop here to have my tank fill-up. It was Saturday, lunch time. Parking was a breeze behind their building. Sweet.,The place its charming, really charming, tiny of course, and I really dig their vibe with the Spanish rock playing. The waitress was very helpful with her recommendations, a big plus. They have a menu call Conscious Cuisine, which I found really cool, with an array of vegan pizzas and some other stuff that right now eludes me. ,I ended up having a Portobello Paninni, that comes with a salad and a vegan strawberry cone for dessert. My only complaint. They just carry soy milk (Soy its a big No-No in my book) as an alternative for their coffee. Wouldn't be nice to have almond milk as well, so patrons can have a super yummy almond cappuccino and feel happy? Just a thought.,Overall, I had a great lunch. I will definitely be back, next time with my vegan tribe."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/29/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Probably the smallest cafe in Miami with the biggest menu. You could seriously eat there every day for months and never order the same thing twice. Incredible selection of really well done healthy dishes and many vegan options. This will be my go-to place for take out and delivery as well. Great local cafe feel with very tight limited seating...you will get to know the folks eating next to you. ,The vegan meatballs were amazing, as well as the veggie wrap. Every dish that came out of the kitchen whizzed right by our noses, and they all looked amazing. Portions are large, so didn't make it to dessert. Desserts are home made and looked insanely good.,I would have given it 5 stars, but it was difficult getting our servers attention throughout our brunch. I completely understand that it was a packed Saturday, but there really aren't too many tables, so."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/28/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Great great Vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. They are big also.  I am never to crazy about their soups, they need to improve by a lot and most important, they need to be hotter and less salty.  If you have never been, give this guys a visit. Its a small charming place.,Parking on the street is a bit difficult and in the back they seem to have parking, they only problem is that the gate to the parking lot is sometimes close. ,Anyways, the food is what is more important and the food here is great."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/11/2018,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I enjoyed my lunch here ALOT.  I got the salmon on a fresh whole wheat baguette (note: bakery fresh , not from a bag).  The garlic aioli was delish and the salad was fresh and tasty.  I reserve 5 stars for the super high end amazing experiences - this was pretty great as a lunch place. My friend wasn't happy because her quesadilla had  real cheese, but since they had a vegan quesadilla on the menu and she didn't order it, I have to side with the restaurant.  I don't think it was their fault.  The quesadilla looked very tasty, even though I didn't get to taste it. I like the funky relaxed vibe.  Definitely would come back to try other things in the future."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/15/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"I've been a regular for years.  Great quality food and some yummy vegan options.  The BF and I like to come here because there is such a large variety.  You can find something for anyone's craving.  Sometimes you can be waiting a while and seating is a little cramped, but no biggie.  They will also deliver through Eat24."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/10/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"So good. Went for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. The food was fresh and delicious. I had the 2 eggs and home fries. LOVED the home fries! Meal was very filling and reasonably priced. I would love to go back for lunch since the sandwiches sounded interesting. I am a meat eater but the vegan/vegetarian options sounded very appetizing and interesting, not your usual salad only type of meals. The only downside is the parking which was tricky and uncomfortable."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/21/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Awesome little place with fresh wraps and paninis. Soups, appetizers and bites are also good choices. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options on menu too. Owner is super nice.  Small place so you want to get there early of late to mIss the lunch crowd and they do a lot of takeout business as well. Definitely worth going. This was our third or fourth time there, and food never disappoints."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/4/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Wonderful! I ordered via Uber Eats . It is always so Fresh and the preparation is so tasting. I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but I always end up eating a wonderful Vegetarian dish, one of my favorite is the Chickpea & Quinoa Salad avocado, cherry tomatoes, onions, feta, corn, and cilantro. served with toasted ciabatta bread . It's helping my Weight Watcher plan. It's perfect for my 2018 Resolution.  My husband loves their Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich mayo, grilled onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and provolone. your choice of bread and your choice of side.  if you need any changes they will always try to accommodate, great place and great people."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/24/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I love this place. Such healthy ingredients and amazing food. It's so tiny in there though so expect a wait on a busy brunch day. It's always good and the staff is always sweet. I've had so many things on that menu but the black bean burger is so goooooood. Greek salad is awesome. Great choices for vegans and vegetarians. Super cute inside. Like I said, not spacious at all."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/22/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,Best restaurant for vegans and non vegans to eat together ! There's a ton of vegan options and cheeses as well as normal food and they have no problem replacing something you see on the menu with a vegan option.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/4/2015,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Not sure what took me so long to ""discover"" Lemoni. Fear of being run over by a Haitian driver perhaps? Ouch. Had to go there. No really, I liked  this charming little cafe and I love that they offer a few vegan options. What they should also add is some gluten-free corn or brown rice tortillas instead of all the wheat breads and wraps. ,My daily special, a grilled faux meatball panini with vegan mozzarella, portabella mushrooms and marinara sauce, was totally delicious. The vegan cheese was actually really good, as was the faux meat made from oats and coconut. Sounds strange, but with the marinara sauce and smoky mushrooms, it worked.,Their dessert offerings are great (brownie a la mode, cheesecake, bread pudding and vegan cupcakes). I am a bread pudding feen. Their cinnamon raisin version with nutella is legit, right up there with Morgan's, Blue Collar and City Hall. And for $6 you get a huge portion. I am not a big fan of raisins and usually prefer some sort of fruit or chocolate in my bread pudding, like Morgan's does. I also didn't notice any nutella in it but overall it was still a very good traditional BP.  I'd pay them a visit just for that (and probably will)."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/10/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Vegan & vegetarian friendly. Great staff & amazing food. You definitely get what you pay for!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2017,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I been coming here for a while and I never had an issue. Everything is always delicious, vegan choices, healthy options . Service is usually great The wine are always with a decent price. I really recommend this place"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/19/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"This place is great. I went to eat there with my mother & even though they had a staff meeting inside their restaurant, they still sat us down outside & took care of us. Extremely nice staff. I ordered hummus & pita bread as an appetizer (among other things) & the kind of pita bread they served, was probably the best pita bread I've ever tried. As an entree, I had the vegan quesadillas. I was not disappointed. Definitely a place you have to try for yourself & explore their large menu. There are so many options to choose from."
"8376 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",6/20/2013,$$,4,Kon Chau Restaurant,"Kon Chau dim sum on a lazy afternoon. This place is understated. Heavy traffic at weekend brunch time, but otherwise peaceful. The food is fast, delicious, and inexpensive. A vegetarian (not vegan) and a meat eater will both leave satisfied. The dining area is simple and unpretentious, unlike many Miami 'pan-Asian cuisine' type places. Dreamy dreamy dim sum is the real deal. ,...and my little brother was digging on the smooth sounds of the 70's."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"I went here today for the first time at my son's request. He's vegan, so there are a lot of options for him here. We arrived around 2:30pm on a Sunday. There were 4 people ahead of us. There were no seats available. There were seats outside, but we were a party of five and all of the tables are 2-tops and can't be moved around. We waited for almost an hour to be sat. I wasn't too happy about that, but it wasn't the staff's fault. There was a table there with their to-go boxes since we arrived, and they just sat there talking for almost an hour after paying! ,The menu is great. Something for everyone! I have very picky eaters in my family. My husband got a meat empanada that was amazing! Then he had a gyro that was also really good! My son had the Mediterranean platter. It was huge and everything was delicious! He also had an order of the vegan meatballs (it comes with 2). They were super good! We shared a plate of the Home potatoes. They were good. My daughter had a Cesar salad and ate every last bite. I had a portabella mushroom and goat cheese sandwich. It was amazing! I really didn't expect much from the place, but they really make every single item very tasty! I wasn't even that hungry, but I ate the entire sandwich. ,It was also very reasonably priced. We all had waters, but the bill was only $65. My son had a ton of leftovers. ,Even though it's a far drive for me, I'll definitely be back. It was worth the long wait."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/7/2018,$$,5,Lemoni Cafe,"Light yet filling, I left feeling brand new! I had the Bean Burger wrap with three bean salad (completely vegan) and was completely satisfied. Even took half of the wrap home. Incredibly affordable, too.,I honestly can't wait to go back and try something else. They have so many great options that cater to any and all dietary needs!,Really great, local ambience. Cute, homey decor. Street parking was pretty easy to find."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/24/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Lemoni Cafe is a charming little spot great for lunch or dinner. Located in Miami Design District's Buena Vista is this beautifully decorated restaurant offering a wide variety of options on the menu to choose from. Take note to the many wonderful vegan and vegetarian options also! The menu is filled with options ranging from small bites, salads, entrés, daily specials, paninis, wraps and so on. Treat yourself to a fresh smoothie or pick from the many different brewed coffee selections. ,Seating was quick which was great for us as some of us had flights to catch that day back to Chicago including myself. We were a group of 5 that came in on a Saturday for an early lunch and we were seated immediately. Upon being seated you are served water infused with fresh mint- very very refreshing. All of us at the table are plant based eaters. We had a wonderful time trying each other's wraps, the vegan quesadillas are really good and so is the caprese sandwich. I had the Tuesday special even though it was Saturday. It was served with a 3 bean salad- very very tasty! ,I would definitely go back to Lemoni Cafe next time I'm in Miami! The group that I was with dines there weekly and everything that they recommended on the menu was delish! If you are ever in Miami check in to Lemoni yelpers and you won't be disappointed!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/5/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Had lunch here and was pleased to see so many vegetarian and vegan options. The menu is huge - so many great items to choose from. I opted for the hummus appetizer and the veggie quesadilla as my entree, and was happy with both dishes. The hummus was flavorful, everyone loved it. The quesadilla portion was really big, enough for me to take some home. My one qualm is that it was a tad bit on the greasy side. Other than that, love everything about this place and will be coming back for more!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/5/2017,$$,4,Lemoni Cafe,"Delicious! I ordered via Uber Eats and everyone at the office was pleased with their meals. Fresh quality food prepared perfectly. It's hard finding restaurant options as a Vegan to eat alongside non-Vegans, but this menu is extensive and you're sure to find an option for everyone. My Vegan Meatball Sub on a whole wheat baguette came with a side salad and was superb, a bit skimpy on the marinara/tomato sauce, but fantastic flavors nonetheless. Everything was hot and fresh and the salad dressing was amazing. I also loved my avocado, date, spinach, mango, and almond milk smoothie. I can't wait to dine in Saturday or Sunday for Brunch, maybe then I'll give it the 5 stars it likely deserves."

Other two: black bean bowls (kale, pumpkin seeds, carrots, onion, garbanzo and black beans in a lemon vinaigrette topped with guacamole).

"701 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/26/2017,$$,4,American Harvest Co,"On a vegan diet for a month. This place has a few vegetarian options. Has to substitute a few things. I ordered the hipster bowl and it was very flavorful imagine adding some protein to that!! And the curry bowl was very healthy and yummy. It was like a home cooked meal. Portions are very filling and prices are great. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu. ,Please get a baby changing table in your bathroom!"

"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/21/2016,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,Oh my sweet baby Jesus. As a vegan it's hard for me to find places to eat this location came up while I was near the area. First off they deliver and they are like a concierge service when you call in so helpful and patients from the call to the delivery the service was impeccable. Now about the food. The veggie burger touched my soul ( not sure if I'm just starving but this thing is beyond delicious) vegan friendly cream broccoli soup and carrot cake. To a vegan goody this is music to my taste buds. This place is a must try
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/4/2016,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,Found this spot on Yelp. My brother wanted lunch and he prefers clean eats and vegan meals at times. This was a perfect choice.

"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/9/2017,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"This place is an absolute gem.  Will has created an environmentally friendly urban paradise in the Health District.  The food is fantastic - it's fresh and accommodates every type of diet I can think of (vegan, gluten free, paleo, even keto).  ,I recommend the cowboy bowl, the veggie burger and the cookies.  ,The prices are totally reasonable and the staff is attentive and helpful."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/11/2017,$$,4,Smart Bites Cafe,Had a chocochya burger which was some sort of seaweed burger with seeds and it was so good with the Chipotle mayo! This was vegan and also they have a good selection of vegan foods off their menu. The entire restaurant is very quaint and cozy with lots of plants and water (you will hardly even realize you are next to a major road)
"701 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/14/2018,$$,4,American Harvest Co,"I went there specifically for the vegan options however, the quinoa patty was not available. Everything else was wonderful clean and great customer service."
"791 NW 20th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/5/2018,$$,5,Smart Bites Cafe,"My (vegan) sister is in town, so we decided to try this place after looking at the menu. Everything was delicious, affordable, and filling! We both had a beet burger that was on special (and recommended by the owner)- it was one of the most incredible vegan burgers I've ever had. I also tried some of my bf's Mediterranean bowl which was also really good and I will probably get for myself next visit. The owner gave us a complimentary cookie for being our first visit, and we will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu."

I am extremely picky about what I eat, as a nutritionist and vegan chef, i completely endorse Dellas Test Kitchen and the people behind it. from what i can tell, this is the best quality food one can find in Miami."

I selected the Mediterranean Bowl, and it was absolutely amazing. I was scared that because it was Vegan it wouldn't be filling, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The shakes are absolutely to die for. If you are in the Wynwood area you absolutely need to try Della!"

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/26/2016,$$,5,della bowls,I went the other day with my family and was quite impressed. Although I do not eat lots of vegetarian/vegan foods I was surprised by how flavorful everything was. I got the Mediterranean bowl and LOVED IT! Everyone working was also very nice and helped navigate us through the menu. It is a bit pricy but definitely worth it!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"A friend did me right with his recommendation of Della Test Kitchen. Food was righteously fine, portions filling, price low, and service fast (It was a rainy Saturday night and not crowded, so I can't say how it is on a busy night.). After reading all the accolades for the Southwest Bowl, I knew my order before reading the menu. I loved it! My wife had the special bowl which she equally enjoyed and the smoothie we shared was tasty. We are not vegans, but enjoy good food and beverages and will return for sure. Some customers bought drinks at the outdoor bar in the open air Wynwood Yard, so if you want liquor with your dinner, it is available. On Saturday night there was a band playing on the stage across the plaza from Della inside the Yard which provided pleasant background music. Check it out."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Vegan, organic, healthy, build-your-own salad bowls. + desserts. laid-back environment. come, chill, and have some good food!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,By far one of my top favorite restaurants. If I didn't live 40 minutes away I would be here everyday. Their bowls are AMAZING and so filling. So full of flavor and deliciousness. Reasonable price considering the amount of food you get. Even if you aren't vegan you will fall in love. I usually stick with the green bowl and I crave it all the time!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/22/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"All vegan hub serving very tasty bowls, smoothies and desserts. I'm not a vegan and I still thought the food was delicious. It's quite on the pricier side: my meal was about $19 (I got an $11 bowl and an $8 smoothie). Not a bad meal at all, but I probably will avoid the eight dollar smoothie for it only being around 14oz."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/24/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Delicious and hearty vegan bowls. I love the red sauce! My only recommendation would be to offer a dessert with peanut butter :)
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/6/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my go to spot. The food is always fresh and the service is great. If you want fresh, raw, vegan food quickly this it the place to go."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The food is outstanding, best vegan place in the area. You can create your own bowl. I ordered the mediterranean and it was perfect, I loved it.  The only thing that I would say it wasn't good is that they allow dogs to be unleashed and pee where the tables are...I saw this big pup peeing twice right infront of me and the owner won't even say sorry...ew"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/3/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My vegan sister brought me here and as someone who LOVES meat, this was an insult at first but I do LOVE my sister so I didn't say anything and gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did! It was absolutely delicious!!! Not to mention the whole location has a wonderful atmosphere and zen vibe to it. I had a wonderful lunch and hope to be back real soon!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Della Bowls has amazingly fresh, vibrant, clean food that tastes as great as it makes you feel! They are conscious through and through, from ingredient selection to choice of disposable products used- and they even have a huge on site garden that they can pick from! Locally made iced tea, fresh teas, smoothies, and raw vegan desserts that taste as decedent as their guilt worthy counterparts. I will be back! Again, and again, and again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Filling food with tons of flavor and zero guilt! Della's customizable bowls are made with healthy ingredients that are irresistible to everyone, whether you are vegan or not.  I find the southwest & green bowls to be especially DELICIOUS and topped with mouth watering sauces that make me drool just thinking about them. The atmosphere at the wynwood yard is casual and inviting, so you can enjoy the outdoors while stuffing your face. This place is heaven! You won't be disappointed."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"The bowls are insanely good! Wow, I went there with my vegan friend and was at first intimidated but kinda just went for it and created my own bowl and it turned out so good and tasty. The staff is amazing and super helpful."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/25/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Was looking for something different...and boy did I find it! Awesome food and the staff is great, especially Asha! Outdoor seating, vegan food truck, free WiFi,  huge portions, and very tasty food!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/30/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Loved this place such a good vegan spot in one of the cutest places I've been to in Miami the food and staff is great can't wait to go back !
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Love the concept. The food is vegan and non-processed. The bowl I got was fresh and tasty. I would add more sauce to the bowls. Make sure you order the biggest bowl, or you will likely go hungry when you leave. Looks like you can bring your dogs if they behave well."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/7/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Best meal I had during my entire trip to Miami. The greens are grown in a garden behind the restaurant . Everything tastes so fresh and it was very reasonably priced considering the quality of the service and the ingredients. Not to mention the location is SPECTACULAR. I would eat here every day if I could. If you're a vegan , 100% come here for your next meal in wynwood !!!!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Hands down one of the best vegan spots in Miami. We had two customized bowl along a green lemonade and almond butter joy. Great food awesome staff and impeccable service.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Yummmmm! My friend recommended the Caribbean bowl and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not vegan but dishes like the Caribbean bowl and all of its flavor could help to sway me.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan food I've had in Miami. Most places offer very few vegetarian options. Della has many of healthy delicious options. Staff was friendly. Definitely going back.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I'm not vegan and this food is still amazing. I had the dalé bowl, which reminds me a lot of just a healthier, yummier version of a Mexican burrito bowl. The atmosphere of Wynwood yard is so quaint with lots of picnic tables and shade and there was constantly a line for this place over the others!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/16/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Very cool. The whole Wynwood yard concept is so much fun. It's a great spot to take your fur baby and chill on an open air cushiony bench in the garden, grab a drink at the stocked bar or grab a bite at Dellas. There are other rotating food trucks in the yard but Dellas is the anchor. The concept is healthy, vegan based on a build your own bowl kind of thing. Choose your base, your protein, your toppings and sauce. Not all that original here in Miami but the whole yard concept is just fun. Everything is outdoors. The bar and Dellas are,Covered but you're still outside so during the summer it's gonna be a bit hot and sticky. Downtown is always hotter than the beach. No wind, no air and it gets crowded there. The bowls are tasty, again not out of this world. The serving size if you get greens as your base, is a bit skimpy for the price. I got greens, chickpeas, lentils avocado and a walnut pesto. Good stuff but was hungry 15 minutes later and $15 lighter. ,It's fun to grab a healthy bite here, they have wifi, you can bring your laptop and your dog and chill. For me those are all big pluses nu today you're just going for a healthy bite, it's solid but not out of this world. ,You can make a whole afternoon of hanging in the yard though and that's fun. Plus you're in Wynwood and O cinema is right next,Door. And afternoon and stretch into the evening and the into the night."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,First time here. Best Vegan Food in Wynwood.. The food was amazing. I had the Southwest bowl with extra spice and a carrot ginger juice.. Will definitely be returning to della. Real soon..
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Let me start by saying this: I am not a vegan.,Della manages to take flavors, mash them together, and create some of the most tantalizing dishes I have ever had, all without an ounce of animal products. Her sauces are completely craveable, which, for vegan food, is a new sensation for me. But seriously, I will be sitting at work and my mouth will start watering just thinking about the Mediterranean bowl. ,I never feel dissatisfied eating Della bowls, which is a huge issue I have with vegan food, and one of the many reasons I am not a vegan. Her grains and artful preparation of vegetables leaves you feeling like you have all the energy you need to power your afternoon. ,Also if you actually can't convince your friends to eat vegan, there are 3 other food trucks right next to it on the Wynwood Yard that are all very good as well!,Get the Mediterranean bowl or the Southwest bowl. BOOM. Della bowls ROCK!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/14/2018,$$,4,della bowls,Creative and tasty vegan options.  I've been a vegetarian for decades and can't figure out why it often upsets my stomach a little bit... but I always go back after a few weeks.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I are not vegan but just fell in love with this place: delicious and healthy bowls, amazing location and super friendly service. We can't wait to come back!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/1/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is my favorite place to eat quick, healthy, and vegan! Every bowl I've had is delicious. My favorite is making my own so it's just what I like. Highly recommend this place"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan bowls in town for sure. The Caribbean bowl is amazing plus it has adashah which is delicious. The broccoli was sooooo good lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Just WOW. Vegan bowls that are soooo wholesome and filling and Delish!. Its a must for food lovers.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I am obsessed with this place. And I've only been here once. I'm actually still halfway through my Dalé  bowl. It doesn't matter if you're vegan or not, the food is incredible. The atmosphere in The Wynwood Yard is unmatched. Come check it out. You cannot be disappointed. If you don't want the bowls already listed, you can create your own! It's really all about you. ,Ah! Ok. I'm going to finish my amazing food."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/14/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Service doesn't exist until you find it. We were told to sit at a table until we were ready to order and waited for close to an hour. After an hour we found a staff member to tell them we were ready to order and they had no idea we were ready to order. They told us after an hour to wait for someone else to find us to order. Have never seen a place so poorly run. Completely unacceptable and people that ordered after us received their food. I've been to the food trucks around Wynwood yard and have been treated with respect but have never been as insulted as well have here. Prep is easy seeing how it is vegan. Bush league presentation. ,Edit: 2 hours after this review....Owner came over to apologize for the service which was incredibly thoughtful and kind. Food finally arrived and was very tasty. We had a variety of the bowls which were delicious just as reviews had promised. Sadly I still had a bad taste in my mouth from a server telling me that the service was delayed because it was raining while those in the kitchen were visually on their phone and not partaking in food prep. I think this is likely an anomaly and hope that others realize this is not a common occurrence."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I came here as a newbie to Vegan food brought by my uncle and his wife who are vegans. I had my doubts of the vegan genre, but was pleasantly delighted (and IMPRESSED) by the food. I ordered the Caribbean bowl which was black coconut rice, adashah, sweet plaintains, kale, avocado, toasted coconut and yellow sauce. Let me tell you, I was impressed from the first bite.  The flavors paired perfectly together and I savored every bite. I will definitely be back next time I am in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/18/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I love this place! Great vegan food with incredible taste! I had a Green Bowl, simply delicious!! The service is quick and friendly. I'll become a regular to this place! Thanks Della"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is by far the best quick, casual, vegan restaurant in Miami. The dalé bowl is excellent and the almond butter cup is out of this world. Cannot wait for their new locations to open."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,They have a lot of interesting selections and the Dale bowl is my favorite.  The atmosphere is nice .  Everything is delicious.  This is one of my favorite vegan places.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,created my bowl and it was AWESOMMMMME! Can't wait to go back and try more! I went with two of my non vegan friends and they loved Della just as much as I did!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"So GOOD everytime i'm in wnywood its my go to place, its a vegeterian and vegans heavan and super filling"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/17/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"The recipes and food looks like it's straight out of Grattitude Cafe in LA.  The original menu looked a rip off also.  The food is really good though, best vegan bowls around anyways.  Doesn't compare to the real Grattitude Cafe, the gang does a great job though.  Really sweet servers and generally chill atmosphere."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/28/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Thank you Della for an affordable vegan option in the Wynwood area! Possibly the only one... It's so appreciated! More more more more places like this in Miami, universe, please!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,What a great place to eat if you want a little bit of everything. My wife wanted vegan so we went. Those things you do for Love.  Ordered a vegan bowl with her I have to say it was very good. It was a little pricey two bowls (which were pretty big) with a coconut water was about $40.00. Don't get me wrong it is really good food and the location is awesome. It Is an open air seating so you feel the air and where the veggies came from. It is good to eat something really healthy
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I recently went Vegan.  So as part of the new eating culture, a place like Della Test Kitchen is a must-try for anyone in Miami.  Located in the Wynwood Yard, Della serves up very high quality offerings.  The selection is impressive - most of the creations are plug-and-play with the ingredients.  You choose items from different categories and they make your creation.  For someone like me, I choose to go along with their pre-selected options, lest I take up too much time in line with indecision, annoying the rest of the people in line behind me.  The Dale Bowl is my favorite so far.  The food is fresh, delicious and filling.  You definitely don't leave hungry.  Even if you aren't vegan, the food is great!  Try it, you'll like it."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Stunning... I love food. And those vegan bowls are amazing ... is clean and tasty. We love the wynwood yard atmosphere also
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Legitimately some of the best food I've ever had. I went there twice during a 3-day vacation in Miami. As a vegan, It was amazing to find a spot where everything on the menu was not only vegan, but also healthy and delicious.,Definitely recommend creating your own half-and-half bowl with black coconut rice as a base. Also try the adashah!,They were out of a few things when I went, so just be mindful of that."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Very cool place. It's located the an area dedicated to food truck but they are stay in food trucks with tables and fans. The food was original and tasty as a vegetarian option. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I enjoyed it. I made my own bowl which was made up of black coconut rice, temps, avocado and plantains!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/16/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"This is a small, casual, unpretentious food truck/outdoor spot in wynwood that serves veggie bowls and smoothies. Everything is vegan. This is a great place to take your food purist friends ;) and anyone on a gluten free diet or lactose intolerant. You can design your own bowl which means you get to pick all the ingredients. ,I had the southwest bowl and the red corvette smoothie (see photos). Very tasty and fresh. I felt satisfied but not overly full.,I would give the food a 5, but the service and prices a 3 ($20 for my two items). So overall a 4. I would come here again, as overall I had a good experience and there are not a lot of places like this in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2017,$$,5,della bowls,If I could give more stars I would!!!! Yummy! I love everything on the menu how easy is it to be vegan and eat so deliciously:-) the Caribbean bowl is my fav but they're all my favorite lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my food hero! Not only has she created a delicious menu of vegan options that are appealing even to a non-vegetarian like myself, but she's also the brainchild behind Wynwood Yard, the space that the truck is situated on, and many of the ingredients in the bowls come from the garden in the back. ,We went during the lunch hour, so it took a little while for the food to come out. I had the Southwest bowl - I liked that  some of the ingredients (sweet potatoes and tempeh) were served warm, and I was pleasantly surprised by how filling and satisfying the bowl was as a meal. It's definitely a great lunch option for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/17/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First time I have a bowl of 100% Vegan fare. I have to admit I was bummed they didn't have salmon or chicken and when I got my bowl I was like meh... until I started eating it! ,No need for animal protein in here. The Caribbean bowl has all I needed. Yes I'll take plantains over chicken :),Great spot and free wifi"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Vegan bowls out of a food truck? My first thought when I heard of Delia's but I'm glad I pushed aside from that. My first time trying them was as delivery. Yummy put a bit more than I like to pay to eat at my desk. ,The Caribbean bowl was memorable enough for me to decide to go check them out in person. Well worth it. ,Inside the Wynwood Yard, this truck has a great location with proper seating and coverage from the sun. Complimentary spa water and quick service and I was sold. The location is fun and there is lots to see/observe. ,Even if you aren't vegan, or vegetarian even, I recommend coming here to carb load on yumminess."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/1/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Excellent vegan food in a super fun atmosphere.  Outside seating, walk-up ordering, and beautifully presented Buddha-bowl-style meals."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,I'm not vegan and the adashah in the Caribbean bowl is amazing. I wish I knew its nutritional value. Will return !
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I was in the area and needed to eat something quick. Thanks god for Yelp and this place did not disappoint. The menu is vegan based, and they do such an excellent job that it's bursting with flavors - for any hesitant people and the ones who love their meat ( I do! ). ,It's worth the visit if you want to try something new. The ambiance is quiet, granted I came during the day which is not when this area is usually very busy. ,So I was going to order the curry bowl, but they had a new one called Dalé (haha!). It was amazing. Anything with avocado has my name on it. They also have the ability to create your own bowl, and they also offer breakfast options, smoothies and desserts. ,Great job and if I find myself in the area again, I'll be back!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Awesome place. The food was really good, and it's a great place to sit if it's not too hot. We got the Caribbean bowl and Dale bowl. Both were good, but I liked the flavors in the latter best. Fresh, healthy, and vegan."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/30/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Few people could be more carnivorous than me. I love meat and I rarely have a meal without an animal in it. I'm also a foodie so just because I enjoy meat does not mean I don't enjoy plants too. I love fruits, veggies, and other non-animal organics. I ate here because my daughter's on a health kick and I figured why not. I can say that if I HAD to be a vegetarian, Della's would be my number one choice!! I had the brown rice, chick peas w sea salt, crispy broccoli w olive oil & garlic, yellow cashew curry, and avocado and loved everything about it. Totally vegan and very filling (took a good portion home). Would definitely eat there again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,One of my favorite vegan restaurants. Best vegan bowls in the city. The cauliflower & mushroom additions made to the menu are . Definitely must check this place out if you want to try vegan food in Miami.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is the i-can't-believe-it's-vegan staple. The bowls here are beyond delicious (I actually crave them daily) and the ambiance is absolutely amazing! It's chill and earthy and organic. Plus everyone that works here is amazing! ,Recommendation: Definitely try their Caribbean Bowl! It's impossible not to love it. If you want a smoothie, they have an almond butter banana one that hits the spot multiple times. ,This is a must try spot in Miami. A place I'd call home. If you haven't been yet... are you really even living?!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Wow! That's the best way to describe this delicious vegan food! So tasty and healthy! I regret not ordering the larger bowl but was just enough to fulfill me. I had the Dale Bowl, so yummy!  I definitely recommend this to all my vegan friends  They also have UBEREATS to deliver! Will order again! Thanks guys!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/24/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Oh, it's all vegan? Yes it is, folks, and let me tell you: I didn't miss meat at all while eating from Della Test Kitchen. ,Their menu consists of bowls that already have the ingredients chosen for you. A friend of mine told me she usually opts for the green bowl that has avocado, broccoli and other types of green veg. I decided to make my own custom bowl with a base of black coconut rice, tempeh protein, sweet potato, yellow curry cashew sauce and toasted almonds. WOW! It was so delicious. I don't think I've ever felt so GOOD and FULL after eating a vegan dish. The portion size was fantastic; I could have saved some for later, but I had a friend help me eat it. Every component of the dish was cooked and spiced to perfection. ,Next time I'm in the Wynwood Yard, I will glady become vegan for a meal without any regrets."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"When I'm in Wynwood this is where I go for my vegan lunch. Really good, fairly fast service and a fun environment. It's outdoors so you can bring your fur kids :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/11/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Yes yes yes! I was having lunch with a dairy-free friend and knew that Della Test Kitchen would be a good place for us to hit up since it's vegan. ,You can create your own bowl or opt for one of the existing combinations. Since I was a first timer, I decided to go with the Southwest bowl of greens, quinoa, tofu, sweet potatoes, tomato, sunflower seeds, avocado and red sauce. I also grabbed some of the hot pepper sauce on the counter to douse on top. It was spicy but went perfectly with this dish. Overall, my bowl was fresh, filling and flavorful. It was hard to finish it all but I couldn't leave one bite because it was that good! I also stole a bite of my friend's Curry bowl. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can find or make a bowl to suit you.,I can't wait to try more combos and would definitely have lunch here weekly if I could! Bowls are $9.50 with smoothies and other drinks costing between $7-$8. You order at the truck and then sit under the tent to wait for your food. It's an overall chill atmosphere and perfect for when it's nice outside.,There seemed to be some confusion among the staff when it came to food getting delivered, so I'd maybe suggest using a number system instead of the name calling. The girl taking our order also had to answer the phone a few times to worry about deliveries, which held the long line up a bit. The food gets to ya eventually and is worth the wait!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This place serves amazing plant based bowls. The Mediterranean bowl is a party in your mouth. Everything fresh and so tasty and very decent prices. I hope this place stays up permanently. The area is so cool and cute, which makes it perfect for a nice late lunch dinner with friends.

However, it being a gorgeous night in Wynwood, live music playing in the background, and pretty stringed lights hung about,  I decided ""why not?"" and tried Della's kitchen and what can I say? Vegan tasted really good. It was filling and satisfying. ,Dellas is a create your own bowl place with options of base, vegetables, faux meats, and sauce. There are also options for bowls per Della's creation. I decided to go with the Caribbean bowl. It was a delicious generously portioned bowl of black coconut rice(so good), plantain, kale, avocado, curry sauce, and a faux meat (I can't recall the name of it). It was very filling and flavorful! There is bench seating right in front of the truck as well as a water station. I  thoroughly enjoyed my late night dinner at Dellas in Wynwood yard and I am looking forward to my next vegan meal there. :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/20/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"In my dream life Della would be my personal chef.  Every Monday I wake up and swear that I will only eat healthy foods ever again. But by Tuesday I am usually craving only the delicious.  Della Bowls nails the healthy and the delicious.  I consider myself a pretty sophisticated cook, but I wasn't able to decipher what was in my bowl.  It was the most incredible mix of flavors and textures. This food is NOT only for the vegans of the world.  It is different and interesting.  I wish I could remember the name of what I had eaten, but based on what I could see on the menu, you can't go wrong.  All of the bowls are winners.  AND if you haven't been to the Wynwood Yard, run!  It's a great mix of food, drink, Music and coolness.  It's perfectly blended to create the setting for a fantastic Della Bowl."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I am absolutely IN LOVE! Have been wanting to try this forever and I'm so embarrassed that I didn't before because it's SO good! Think of a healthy vegan chipotle, the possibilities are endless when it comes to creating your perfect bowl. They even offer black coconut rice, which I have never seen before. And to super size your bowl for just a few extra bucks, you get to choose two of each category and basically have two meals! ,Of course once my friend, Danny, told me about this option, I had to super size it. Best decision ever cause my leftovers were like a golden midnight snack. So light and filling! The sauces are amazing, they drizzle plenty over your creation. I had the tempeh, and at first bite, you get this instant teriyaki type tofu taste. So delicious. And you MUST try their plaintains because they are the best ever! Usually plaintains are super oily from your typical Latin restaurants but not Della's! They're baked into ooey gooey sweetness pieces of perfection. ,This food truck is poppin inside a little area called Wynwood Yard. They're closed on mondays so be sure to come every other day as it's worth it! I was so pleased with every little thing in my bowl, I will come back over and over to try the entire menu! By the way, they only give you one slice of avocado so think about that before you ask for it lol"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/7/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I happened upon della bowls at Wynwood Yard on our first night in Miami. It was recommended to us by the woman from the store right next to it and she did not steer us wrong. Absolutely the best vegan food we had on our trip! We had the dalé bowl (at the cashiers recommendation) and BYO with black coconut rice, adashah, kale, sweet potatoes, avocado and gold sauce. They were both insanely delicious! Both sauces were incredible and the adashah is so creative and versatile! Della makes food the way I cook at home, only better. My wife and I loved it...so so great!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The idea behind most of Della Test Kitchen's offerings is simple: vegan proteins, veggies, and a sauce on a base of rice, quinoa, or greens in a bowl. The execution, however, is delicious. I've recommended it to people visiting Wynwood and have taken people there when I am in the area. The food is consistent and never disappoints. ,You can create your own bowl or select one of their recommended combinations. I've tried about 4 at this point, and they've all been good. There are multiple flavor profiles available, so there is bound to be something to suit your tastes. ,They also have some other things on the menu, like juices. I have had one of the juices and it was tasty.,The actual kitchen is a trailer in Wynwood yard. There is metered street parking right out front. The setting is quiet, and there are several picnic tables under a covered area. Because it is outside, it is pet friendly. The tables are decorated with succulents and the surrounding landscaping is lush enough that it feels a lot greener than most parts of typically industrial Wynwood.,Water pitchers and disposable cups are available, but because they use a refillable glass pitcher, you can also bring your own water bottle and fill it on your own if you're trying to minimize your waste."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Favorite vegan place in Miami!! I come all the way from Aventura just to get a bowl , hope to see it soon near Aventura"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First off, I am not a vegan but I loved this place!! I was introduced to Della by a friend who has been a vegetarian for a while now and she recommended this while we were at Wynwood Yard. I'm so glad she did!! Whenever I think vegan, I've always thought of super healthy, dry, not very pleasant vegetables. This was the total opposite. Della has their signature mixed bowls or you can build your own. There are smoothies and desserts. They also have salads. The staff was very nice and was able to answer all our questions. ,I built my own half and half bowl, which is two of every category. I got quinoa and black coconut rice(forbidden rice) with tempeh, chickpeas, crispy broccoli, sweet potato, toasted almonds, pico de gallo on the side, and the yellow curry cashew sauce along with the green garlic here pesto sauce. This was packed with nutrition and full of flavor. Blew my mind. The chickpeas were soft, tempeh was tangy ginger tasting, the broccoli was perfect, the pico was refreshing. I loved the black rice. It's so fragrant and absorbs the sauces very well. Never knew I would crave a vegan rice and veggie bowl but if all vegan food tasted this good, I'd consider dropping meat!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/9/2018,$$,3,della bowls,"I'm gonna be honest - I'm vegan and I make nutri bowl/Buddha bowl often. I'm used to eating and working with the same ingredients as Della Test Kitchen serves. I had the make-your-own bowl and I was disappointed. For almost 12$ I got a bowl of rice, with sweet potato, tempeh and pico de Gallo (which tbh must have been dirt cheap to make). I just feel like it's overpriced for a vegan dish that doesn't require that much effort and when it's from a FOOD truck. Food truck food shouldn't be expensive lol! Anyways, the bowl made to order wasn't impressive and I won't be going back when I can go down the street to a REAL restaurant to get a fresh wrap or bowl for cheaper!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Miami needs more places like Dellas. Absolutely love their bowls. I typically build my own and mix and match ingredients. My best bowl combo: black coconut rice, tempeh, broccoli, avocado, and yellow sauce. The yellow sauce is a coconut curry cashew base; it's so good you'll want extra (only $1 - get the extra sauce, trust me). The bowl is the perfect size to fill you up, but you can always get a super-sized bowl when you're feeling extra hungry. Love the set up of the place in Wynwood Yard - great for a casual al fresco lunch. My one suggestion is for Dellas to get some stronger fans around the seating area; it gets super hot there in the summer. Besides that, keep it up Dellas. Love what you're bringing to the Miami vegan scene."

I can't wait to come back and try more off their menu. They're very kind and accommodating for any dietary restrictions like vegan or vegetarian. Would definitely suggest checking this place out. Their inside a Plaza so there's tons of parking."

Amazing service and awesome food! :)"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",3/16/2017,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Place is a little expensive but worth it on a treat yourself kind of day, I love the vegan gyoza and the taro bubble tea, the bubble tea was especially sweet and so good! I've been there 3 times and the only thing I didn't like was their vegan sandwhich, the bread was stale and the sauce didn't really taste that good, but other than that, I fully recommend their desserts, their tea, gyoza, soup etc etc"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/10/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Was bored of the usual coffee places nearby when I found this little cafe. Had their spicy Raman and vegan gyoza. The spicy Raman was really good and the gyoza was ok.. I wish they introduce chicken gyoza also. I had their coffee frappe and my friend had the green tea frappe. ,Too full to try the raindrop cake but I m coming back soon to have it. ,Yes! They have the raindrop cake!!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Went here for a little lunch date with my best friend. Sadly, they were out of vegan gyoza but I got the tofu sampler instead. I love tofu, and that dish wasn't huge but it was so yummy and it filled me up, especially with the large tea I ordered. I can't wait to go back and try more of their vegan options!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/18/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I absolutely love this spot! The food is so yummy and delicious. I enjoy coming here because it has a great ambiance! I also enjoy the vegan options! This place is definitely a favorite of mine ! I love bringing my friends here. The employees are also very attentive and endearing!
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",9/29/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I go to this place all the time because of its location. Love their vegan spicy ramen and their Yaki Udon. Definitely a vegetarian friendly place with options for everyone. You can't leave here without having their Zombie Plant dessert. It's sooooo good. I love watching it transform and then devouring it moments later. Can't wait to try their other desserts. Would love to see some new vegan/vegetarian options on the menu in terms of entrees but I love what they have right now so no complaints.
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/1/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"On my top 5 of best hole in the wall Asian restaurants in Miami. Delicious options for everyone including vegan or vegetarian. Tastes very authentic and leans towards Korean flavors and inspirations. Dessert, dinner, or just coffee are all wonderful choices. I've been numerous times but my favorite dish is the Spicy Ramen."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",11/25/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"If you're vegan and love Thai food, this is your place. The menu is plentiful and the food is delicious. Best of all, the staff is so very pleasant and accommodating to changes. If you have a dietary restriction, I highly recommend."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/18/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"107 Coffee & Desserts is my favorite place right now, either to have some lunch with a friend or to do my school work. The environment is very enjoyable, staff is nice and friendly, and food is amazing . I come here at least twice a week. Vegans and Vegetarians, I highly recommend this place. It's always a struggle to us finding places to eat, but you will feel appreciated here."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",12/18/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"I'd never expect to find this place in the shopping center where it is. The staff is so friendly (Asian) that they gladly made Cuban coffee for a local woman who came in yelling asking if they had any. I've had the tofu pad Thai, spicy ramen and veggie gyozas and all are pretty great. Not the best pad Thai I've had but definitely the best tofu I've ever had. Most of the menu options can be prepared vegan or vegetarian. They'll assume you'll want a fork, so extra points if you ask for chopsticks instead."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/15/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is one of my faves! It's quaint with modern yet rustic decor. The menu is written on a huge chalkboard and ordering is done at the counter. The food is delicious, I've been there a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Korean rice bowl, the portion is large and the flavors are on point. Surprisingly the desserts are also good. The strawberry crepe is amazing! Light & fluffy and not too sweet. They also have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus. Service is friendly and there is plenty of free parking available."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/27/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Absolutely my favorite place ever. The staff is beyond amazing. I always get taro or coffee Boba here, and the vegan gyoza. The only thing is that I wish they had LOWER PRICES. this is next to fiu and a lot of my friends don't like to go since a bowl of noodles is $13. It is a bit over priced. But nonetheless AMAZING food. Amazing staff. Amazing decoration"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",7/9/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"What a great little restaurant. Really polite service, especially from Vanessa who I had a very nice conversation with at the bar. Vegan options are also available. I had the Pad See Ew with tofu and no eggs and it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",2/12/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I lost track of how many times I've been to this gem. After a long day of studying, it's so comforting to indulge myself in a hot bowl of ramen. Flavorful food and divine desserts. The Spicy Ramen is amazingggg. It doesn't matter if it's chicken, shrimp, pork, or tofu; they're all lovely. They also have a ton of vegan options which is a huge plus. Make sure to leave room for dessert! My favorite dish here is the Zombie Plant! Only order it if you have enough time to wait for it to be prepared because it does take a long time (~25 minutes). I promise you it is worth every second. It has layer over layer of ice cream, fruit and pound cake all topped with ""dirt"" and served with milk on the side to pour over. It is to die for!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2018,$$,3,107 Taste 味,"I found this place while looking for vegan/vegetarian friendly places. Loved the spicy ramen. All tough the menu says to advise them if you are VEGAN, DO NOT, been here three and times they have practically laughed in my face all of them. Matcha latte, recommended as well as the vegetable steamed dumplings. Downside, the plastic utensils. Love the menu options and ambience, only wish they were more mind-full of peoples dietary choices."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/20/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"I've been there twice and would come back again! It's great for vegans and vegetarians! Food is delicious, one of my favorite bowls is the Caribbean. You may choose from a variety of options from beans, green veggies to quinoa and brown rice. ,I find the price inexpensive compared to other places I've been to within the area of Wynwood. It is worth trying at least once! ,Service wise, I cannot say a lot because it kinda of work like a fast food truck with the difference that this is healthy food. ,A great plus is that you can seat there and relax listening to live music from the Wynwood Yard! I love it!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/9/2018,$$,3,della bowls,"Well I am usually a fan of anything vegan even though I am not a vegan myself. I was very excited to try the Caribbean bowl. Got it delivered very quickly with Uber eats and I also ordered the Cocoa Berry Bliss smoothie. ,The bowl had a nice presentation.  The kale greens were very bright and beautiful.  The avocado was also very black inside and had a very bitter taste. I would have preferred if the avocado was maybe sliced instead of a half just placed in the center.I usually love plantains in vegan bowls but some plantains were rock hard and others were ok. There was nothing very special about the bowl and I did not finish it because of the sour taste from the avocado and the hardness of the plantain. The Yellow Sauce had a nice flavor but also nothing special. ,The smoothie was not a smoothie at all. I could barely drink it. It was so chunky and I was not able to drink it. ,The best thing honestly was the pico de gallo which is usually not hard to mess up.,I really wanted to enjoy my meal and I really hate spending money on horrible food but this just wasn't for me. I would try again in the future but not anytime soon."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/6/2018,$$,4,della bowls,"we were on vacation with the family in Miami and decided to have a vegan meal. Seeing prior reviews, we decided to go down to Wynwood and give Della Bowls a try.,The food was made to order and the bowls were tasty. My wife decided to create her own bowl while I went with the Southwest bowl. We both enjoyed our meals and the servings were plentiful. ,The dessert options were very nice and the brownie sundae was awesome. ,The venue was very fun and the live music was great. ,We would definitely recommend this spot for a casual vegan meal with friends."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/11/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"The perfect place for anyone who's looking for delicious vegan options. They're located inside the wynwood yard and best of all, they're also available via Uber eats! I had the southwest bowl- very spicy, but very tasty if you can handle it. i also had the cocoa berry bliss smoothie. Definitely planning on trying some of their other bowls soon :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"i'm obsessed w della!! idk how i haven't given this 5 stars yet, i should have reviewed this place years ago! ok so-- i like the option of building your own bowl (i get the half and half form more options) or the premade bowls. everything is vegan and wholesome and you don't feel like crap after you eat it. i could drown everything in the green sauce. the food is always fresh and worth it's,value. the service is always good. one of my fav restaurant atmospheres--you never know who might be playing on the stage a few feet away ;) outdoor, care free, cozy vibe. great either during the day or at night. you can tell there was a lot of soul put into this."

The atmosphere  is fun, the food is fresh, the sauces rock!

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/1/2018,$$,3,della bowls,I am not sure if I really like this place yet or not. I ordered the Caribbean bowl on my the first time there.  The black coconut rice was way too hard. I devoured ot though because that's what a hangry person does.  I do have to admit and say the curry sauce was great! The bowls come in a large bowl... extraaaa large that is! There is ample space st the tables to sit amd enjoy your meal.  On my second time there.... I ordered the Dalé bowl. Meh.  It was alright.  Not the best. I think the flavor pairings for that bowl should be reviewed. It is a test kitchen. I came back again for a third time but did not order.  I sampled the tempeh. It was cold and dry. I wasn't really impressed. It is definitely not a bad option for a vegan meal considering the other options offered at Wynwood Yard.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,della bowls,This place is delicious. There aren't many vegan options in Miami the land of pig lard in pretty much everything. To find a vegan place is always an exciting thing especially one with food as delicious as Della bowls. My only complaint is that they are in wynwood yard which is far and annoying to park. I wish they were more centric so I can go all the time :3! The bowls are top notch and filling! You can tell all the ingredients are top notch! I love their sauces and love that you can buy them no
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/21/2018,$$,4,della bowls,"ITS NOT JUST FOR VEGANS!,Della bowls - need I say more?  4 stars. You can't go wrong here.  This place finds a way to make vegan fill your belly - and at a good price.  I regularly snag pickup for lunch, and I'm always feeling refreshed and recharged for the rest of the day. ,Parking = easy, lots of it on the street and side streets,Ambiance = outdoor seating, live music often, bar nearby ,I would definitely recommend Della's to anyone trying to get into vegan food, or anyone who's hungry!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/5/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Found a delish #vegan spot in Miami in the wynwood area.  Delish plant based bowls.  I got the dale bowl and my husband the Caribbean bowl. You choose your base, veggies who h were all good make or sweet potatoes and my favorite ripe plantains, sauce and extra topping like avocado or pico de gallo pepitas or toasted coconut or almonds.,Almond butter joy smoothie was good too.   Healthy and delish is the best combo.  Out door seating on this beautiful day was a plus."

The food is absolutely delicious. There's nothing that I've tried from here that isn't amazing. My top favorites are Spicy Ramen, Yaki Udon and Pad Thai! Best part is that they have vegan friendly versions. The staff is extremely kind and it feels like you're eating at a friends house because of how comfortable this spot is. Check it out, you won't regret it."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/6/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is incredible! They have delicious food and excellent service. Halley really elevated the experience, she has exceptional customer service skills, she is friendly and professional.

"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I've tried many spots for Ramen and this place is by far the best in Miami. I always order a Vegan Shio Ramen along with the Vegan Gyoza's and/or the Vegan Pad Thai. All the food is always made to order so it comes out warm and fresh. The taste of the broth in the ramen is delicious (add a little sirracha if you want a spicy kick), the pad thai noodles are always cooked very well (add cabbage!). For dessert I always get the Nutella Crepe Cake which is probably what the restaurant is known most for.,This is a order over the counter restaurant but the lovely staff brings you your food to the table once its ready. The restaurant is usually busy but they always manage to bring out the food in a timely manner. I am excited to continue to come to this establishment and try some of their other items as they all look so great! I come here almost every week and would recommend any Yelper's out there to do so as well."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Love this place! Great bubble tea, easy to make something vegan or shellfish free if needed. Lots of tasty options. My only complaint is that I wish they had lunch specials and I way to combine small plates. They should really think about having a menu like that especially for the students and university lunch community."
"3067 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/26/2012,$$,3,Jaguar Latin-American Kitchen,"This food would get another star if I weren't vegan and gluten-free. The ceviche is amazing but vegans and vegetarians will feel left out from this course of the meal. There are several delicious salads that are safe for vegans or people with Celiac's disease. There's one entree suitable for people with those requirements and another that's probably easily convertible. The service is average. The staff are polite enough and the owner recognizes and greets regulars. The price is reasonable for the area. It's a little loud and crowded, anticipate a wait during peak hours. This is a great place for people with food allergies to get a tasty light lunch and suitable for large groups with members with sensitive tummies."
"3067 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/1/2015,$$,5,Jaguar Latin-American Kitchen,"As s vegan, still my favorite restaurant. I try to go once a week, it's an obsession.. I always get something new. Now that I'm eating poultry and such again, I'm just in heaven.  Everything is amazing!!!!"

It has outdoor seating and indoor seating serving a gourmet menu that has plenty of options including a great surprise a god menu!! So it's outdoors with a family friendly environment  with slides and activities for the children, animal friendly with a puppy menu and amazing service and friendly professional staff. The manager Francesco was wonderful in his menu suggestions and accommodated all of our requirements as we were a vegan and vegetarian table. My puppy was over the moon in a place where he can eat at the same time as us and then play freely in the park. ,Simple outstanding a must visit!!"
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"Glass & Vine is a great date spot. The outdoor seating at night presents a romantic ambience. There's lots of trees with twinkling lights and nice background music. As a vegetarian, the menu wasn't as impressive as the setting. Wish we had more options. I ordered the semolina pasta, which is the only main dish option that I had to choose from. I recommend adding a couple more vegetarian + vegan options to the menu to accommodate to all types of guests, because this place does have an amazing ambience."
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/24/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"2 la mulas and 1 gin blossom! De-lish- us!!! I came here on a Wednesday night for happy hour which is from 5-7p. Great vibe. It's an outdoor bar/ restaurant but they have ""indoor"" seating, but the entire restaurant is still an  open concept. They had a DJ playing tropical chill kind of music. Great to catch up with friends or a first day date (in my opinion at least)- not an intimate vibe but comfortable. The bartender was so sweet, unfortunately I didn't get her name- but everyone there is just so friendly. The chef even came to greet us and ask if we had any questions about the menu. A must try is the 'charred cauliflower' and the 'fried yuca'- it was so yummy I couldn't even take a picture of it! Sorry!! Very stand up place for the summer- it'd confidently give it a 5/5. Definitely would go back. Vegetarian friendly (vegan if you ask for no cheese)"
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/14/2015,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! So you want to arrange a casual night out for the group. Should be simple, but it's not. You'll be six, or maybe nine. Four will be on time, one a little late, someone else very late, and oops! The babysitter flaked out, so now there's a last minute +1 or 2 little ones. And your best friend is vegan, and you don't like seafood. Four of 6 people are gluten-free, 1 doesn't drink alcohol, 3 of you can't tolerate spice, and somebody's an ovo/lacto vegetarian. To put it bluntly, your group is an absolute hot-mess, server's NIGHTMARE! Fear not. Mina's can handle it.,Step 1: Refer to the box on the top left of the menu and order the ""dips"" as a shared appetizer. You can get a variety of yummy, healthy snacks like hummus and tzatziki. They come with homemade pita bread, but you can ask for a couple of orders of Crudités for the gluten-frees. And the menu includes a couple of really tasty vegetarian entrées, there's a delicious homemade lemonade for tea-totalers, there's an amazing dish of mussels to share, and the wines are priced right by the glass or the bottle. NO NEED TO GET YOUR PRIVILEGE IN A BUNCH! The server has seemingly unlimited patience and professionalism. He will listen to your long list of special needs and make helpful suggestions without batting an eye. He almost seems to care that oregano gives Tiffany hives and wheat makes Brandi's belly bloat. Not only that, but he's happy to stand up on a chair to take the perfect group photo for the obligatory FaceBook post.,Step 2: Sit back and enjoy your special evening. The food is great, the service even better, and the space is beautiful. High ceilings and comfy seats. There's enough space between the tables to chat and toast and laugh without disturbing anyone. You'll actually relax and have a great time!,One last note: Mina's has ample free parking in a private lot behind the restaurant. No drama, even on a Saturday night."

My BF who is Vegan had an Eggplant dish that was also great. I would had given it a 5 except that I was looking for more info on the food I was eating,  an explanation on what the food was and how to eat it. It was my first time eating Egyptian food and didn't know how to put it all together. I will Def go again."

Some of our favorites were the vegan moussaka, calamari, stuffed grape leaves, and the Besara dip. Quality ingredients & great service. Easy parking, too."
"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/13/2017,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"Went here for dinner with my wonderfully picky partner. I loved the ambience of the place. And while the service was slow and the server not too knowledgeable about vegan choices the meal (Vegan Moussaka) was very good...better than my partners vegetarian meal. Using Yelp also allowed me a free dish of hummus, which was hummuslicious."
"646 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/5/2018,$$,3,109 Burger Joint,"This place is okay. The veggie black bean burger was yummy, and so were the fries. Not the best, not the worst. Apart from that, they didn't really have many vegan or vegetarian options. I don't even think they had many healthy options at all, from what I recall (I don't remember there being a salad option, but I could be wrong. If there was a salad option, it was probably sub par or I would remember ordering it).,The servers were friendly, but severely understaffed. The wait time is FOOORRREEVVVVEERR (*insert Sandlot gif here*). I'm not exaggerating. I have visited here twice; once with family and another time with friends, and we had to wait about 1-2 hours maybe? Quite a while, especially since neither of those times were especially busy. Well, maybe the second time but not nearly enough for the wait time to be that long. Maybe they've cracked down on the promptness, though, as this was awhile back. ,The parking is pretty bad. It's free, but the spaces are limited. This place is practically designed for students who park across the street or in 109 towers or 4th street commons. ,They do have trivia night, though! I believe they host them on Tuesdays. I've never been, but my brother goes sometimes and he always has fun. ,If you're not a picky eater and don't have a car, then this place is probably great. If you're a health conscious vegetarian or on a diet that isn't Atkin's or have a gas guzzling, carbon Big Foot printing hummer, go elsewhere."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2017,$$,4,Café Roval,"Mmmm! We had been here several weeks ago for dinner and decided to come back for brunch. We were not disappointed. The ambiance is fabulous. We sat inside for dinner, outside for brunch; a total European vibe. We would have liked to have seen Kois in the pond in the outside garden. The salmon board and vegan board were both delicious. Lobster Benedict was sprinkled with chunks of main lobster, but was missing some kick. Tres leches pancakes were a bit too cakey, but the flavor was on point. American platter was nice, pretty hard to get wrong. Mimosas were yummy...fresh squeezed oj. Latte, Americano and macchiato were good. ,Café Roval is super chill. Service was what we expected, think European style. The staff aims to please. I wouldn't come here if I was in a rush. The value was a bit pricey for what we had, but weighing it out, we'd still come back. The crowd was what I call, ""The Miami Mix""; Gays, Jews, Luncheon Ladies, Couples and Young Families...perfect! Next trip we'll try other items on the menu. Remember, this is Soyka's sister restaurant. It took a few months in the beginning for Soyka to get it right, my educated guess tells me that Café Roval will completely deliver soon enough and get their five *****'s."
"5808 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",1/12/2017,$$,5,Café Roval,"This place is so cute! I used to looove Van Dyke's on Lincoln Road, so I was very upset when it closed years ago. I'm so happy that Cafe Roval exists now! The food is delicious! The vegan and vegetarian options are fantastic. We had the sprouted chickpea cakes, which are delicious - I recommend. Then my mom had the vegan option, which is a stir fry, which she loved and I had the seafood special which was shrimp in polenta. Everything was super yummy and my mom has gone back 3xs already! Definitely a staple for us now. Also, the homemade iced teas are fantastic - I had the cucumber-lemon grass and it was so refreshing and light. The service is also very nice, informative and they go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable experience. Definitely check this place out, it's super charming and delicious. Also make sure to walk around the restaurant to see the patio in the the back and the pond!"

They have rotating specials that are reasonably priced. Come and support this gem in Downtown Miami!"

We found the House of Food Porn accidentally in Little Haiti because we wanted to try something new. Being a foodie I was curious about the name, so I made a reservation for a private shushi (YES THIS IS THE NAME!) tasting. What a culinary dream adventure, my friends loved the unique concept of stuffing sushi rolls with cooked home made food of all countries in the world. We tried the German, French, Swedish, Caribbean, Vegan, Cuban roll and had mini chocolate lava cakes with vanilla ice cream for dessert, so so so super yummie!!  Chef Frank made us feel welcome & home in his kitchen, it was a great experience and next time we will for sure order his catering for our anniversary!!!"

We made a reservation for a private birthday party at the House of Food Porn and we were just amazed how cool the spot works. Chef Frank creates rolls with all different kind of flavors, it was super yummie. We loved the Mac'n cheese roll, the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp roll and the Virginia crabcake roll toped with red Seaweed pearls these little explosions made our palate jump with joy!!! Our hostess made sure we always had water, wine and more important FUN, WE HAD A BLAST!!! Also our vegan friend was not left behind, Chef created spontaneously a veggie Tapioka roll with black beans, sweet potatoe, chiyote and roasted beets inside, even we loved this one!!! Dessert was insane, lavacake with molten chocolate core crowned by vanilla ice cream. We had the whole restaurant for ourselves, took pictures in front of the House of Food Porn wall of fame :-))) Highly recommend this speakeasy place, definitely a must to check it out! Thank you Frank & Nicky, we had a great time!"

My family and I got there as soon as it opened and we had lunch. We don't eat meat and there are lots of vegetarian options. I ordered the veggie burger and my dad ordered the vegan jambalaya.

"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",12/29/2017,$$,5,Lokal,"Went here because I heard their vegetarian/vegan options were outstanding and I have had trouble finding great veggie options in Miami thus far. Lokal did not disappoint! I had the Veggie Burger, which honestly exceeded my expectations; the menu description sounded pretty good, but when it came to the table, I had to think twice because it had the charred-and-pink look of a medium-cooked burger. It was damn delicious--if you have tried the Beyond Burger, it is similar to that, which I was not expecting. The sweet potato fries were also on point. My husband got the Vegan Jambalaya (we were especially excited for this because that's his fave dish, but can be difficult to recreate vegetarian), and it was insanely good. The vegan Andouille sausage they use was crazy good, and the spice level was great.,The hostess and waiter were very friendly and helpful. We came on a Thursday night around 6:15pm expecting that it would be empty-ish, but it was already full. Can't wait to come back for that burger again!"
"3190 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",9/24/2017,$$,5,Lokal,"Absolutely love this place!! Located right in Coconut Grove, Lokal offers fantastic food with an even more awesome theme. With an 80's vibe, you can get a nice cold one from local Miami breweries and enjoy the great finds they have on their menu! Vegetarians are even welcome: I had their Black Bean Burger (so delicious) and tried their Vegan Jambalaya. Both I have to say were made very well and I would definitely see myself coming back again. The service here is very friendly and attentive. One thing I love about this place is their involvement with other local companies in the area. ,Keep up the good work and I'll be back real soon!"

Its simple: pick your protein, rice bowl or sandwich and pick 2 sides (including soup and salad)!! They make it fresh and bring it to you! Absolutely delightful! Everyone's super nice and the music has an old school vibe. Everything had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but I loved it and I don't like spicy food. Loved this place. Will come again!!

There are great vegan and vegetarian options as well as paleo, and straight up American foods like salmon and burgers. ,I have been in Miami and Fort Lauderdale for 3 weeks and this is my favorite place. ,The food was super fresh,vegetables were cooked to perfection with very light yet flavorful sauce. The vegan soup of the day was ginger carrot with coconut milk base. We ordered one to share and they split in two bowls.  One order was plenty for two to share. And the flavor was just great! Subtle with just the right hint of ginger.,We also shared the paleo plate with two sides. Generous portions again.  We chose the broccoli & cauliflower and jasmine rice for sides and the flavor again, was just perfect. ,Will definitely be back. My only minor concern is the music was too loud.  I didn't say anything but given the excellent customer service, I am sure they would have fixed it. ,I believe they are only open til 4 pm otherwise would definitely go back for dinner since last night in Miami! ,This is my number one casual restaurant in Miami!"

The staff gave excellent service and the food was delish. My GF is a vegan and I'm not gonna lie, her vegan dish of the night tasted better than the filet minon I got ( To clarify the Filet was still amazing!!). I would defenetly recommend this for any couple looking for something new! I will defenetly be going back for another date night."

"5556 NE 4th Ct, Miami, FL 33137",12/28/2014,$$,5,Soyka,"I've been coming here for years, and it remains my favorite restaurant in all of Miami.  What I like about it is that it is an extremely well-rounded place:  it's great for a date, it's great for a special occasion, it's great when you're dressed up, it's great when you're very casual, it's great for groups, it's great when you're by yourself.  This flexibility extends to the menu.  It's not an overwhelming menu, but it has a little of almost everything, and most folks, even picky eaters, vegans and discerning foodies, would be hard-pressed to not find something in the menu of their liking.  ,Yes, like EVERY restaurant, the kitchen sometimes swings a strike, but by and large, the food is almost always exquisitely prepared with fresh ingredients.  They have live music most evenings and for Sunday brunch they feature an excellent piano player of the highest caliber specializing in Cuban Danzón, although his repertoire is also diverse.,One of the great attributes of Soyka is that it is a family-owned and operated restaurant, with very low turnover in its staff.  Very impressively, the owner's two children, a brother and sister duo, work there also, and not as managers ordering people around, but as bartender, servers and hosts, busting their behinds on late nights and weekends (where else in Miami would you find this?).  Their work ethic is exemplary and they are two of the nicest, down-to-earth people one could meet.  Kudos also to Alan, the general manager, for running a tight ship.,I would definitely recommend Soyka to local and visitor alike.  You will not be disappointed."

Every time I come here I have the al pastor (pork) and I try a different one. I've had the Baja fish and the shrimp and they are super good. The guacamole is off the chain and super chunky. The carne Asada tacos are what keeps me coming back. I will definitely be chasing this taco spot over any of the other ones In wynwood. They also have vegan/vegetarian options! ,Ps- they also make everything right when you order so everything is very fresh."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/2/2012,$$,4,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"I really like this place, great salads, an awesome burger and plenty of options for anyone (well I'd have to check for vegans). It is an order at the counter place that brings food to the table, which I love because it means their prices are fair without wait staff overhead. The ambiance is great and the covered outdoor seating is nice when it isn't too windy."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/10/2012,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"This may be an unfair review because I have only ever ordered the vegan pad thai but I have to say it is phenomenal. I find myself craving it at times ... that's how good it is.,I'm not a fan of tofu but the pad thai comes with it on top. The tofu looks like nothing special and kinda gross, in general (that's how I feel about tofu overall), however the way it's flavored is really pretty good. The noodles, however, are just amazing and fresh. It's just so amazing.,My partner regularly orders the mofongo and switches up the meat that goes with it. He finishes it every time (which is a feat because the portions are HUGE). ,I loved how casual it was relatively comfortable the atmosphere is. As is true to Wynwood it's more trendy-hipster-chic than anything, but it was nice because the food and alcohol selection was legitimately delicious and impressive.,Also, there is a wide array of choices so it's not just strictly amazing mofongo, like I said, I had pad thai but then there are also salads, sandwiches, bizarre yet delicious appetizers, etc.,It's a must and I will be back."
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/22/2017,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,The food at jimmyz is always great. We gone there with bunch of friends many times and it's always a fail safe restaurant. When I used to eat seafood (now a vegan) use to get the ahi plate or sandwich and it was amazing. The price is decent and the people there are friendly and very helpful.
"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/8/2016,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,Hipster ambience with great Puertrican fusion food and vegan options. Owner is most of the time on-site ensuring service and food quality is to his high standards.

"2700 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/3/2018,$$,5,Jimmy’z Kitchen Wynwood,"Had the Ahi Tuna Special, was amazing! So flavorful and just the kick I was looking for. Their Vegan soup is delicious as well. Staff was super friendly, restaurant was SPACIOUS and extremely cool (which was good)! Great beverage and beer options! Will return soon! Keep it up Jimmy'z!"
"500 Brickell Key Dr, Miami, FL 33131",5/22/2016,$$$,5,La Mar by Gaston Acurio,"We picked the perfect place to celebrate our son's graduation. The food was superb, the pisco sours and Chilcanos amazing, the ambiance perfect and the service beyond our expectations! They realized without us mentioning it that we were celebrating our son and they took it upon themselves to bring him out a complimentary dessert. They went out of their way to accommodate the vegan diet of one in our party and we're just all around kind and attentive.  Everything we ordered was delicious! From the Anticuchos to the causa and jalea, and to top it off the Fideos Machos were simply amazing!! Thank you La Mar for a perfect lunch!"
"218 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/15/2018,$$,4,GK Bistronomie,I'm not a huge fan of Peruvian cuisine but this place certainly changed my mind.  It's one of just a handful of places that I have been to that offer a vegetarian/vegan ceviche.  I went with my family and everyone gave it a thumbs up.  Portions even for appetizers are on the larger spectrum of things.  There are several tapas here so you can have fun trying a few things out at once.  Street parking only which is typical for this area.  Had a nice time and would return.  The brunch menu opens up the restaurant to even more choices and prices are reasonable.  More of a fusion than a hard core Peruvian restaurant and I think that makes it more desireable.
"15 Se 10th St, Miami, FL 33131",5/9/2013,$$,3,Perricone’s Marketplace & Cafe,"I know its Miami, but still expensive for what it was.  For $8 per dessert, and looking at them in their market, I was expecting something amazing.  They were only OK.  Not terribly vegan/vegetarian friendly.  I had the spinach salad without the chicken or cheese so I spent $18 for some spinach basically.  I know some reviewers will have a different experience since they're not vegan, but for a vegan/vegetarian person, I'd pass.  Food was OK, but not worth the price."
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/1/2015,$$,3,Joey’s,"Food was good! Dined with 4 teenagers, 1 vegan, & 1 pescetarian! There was something for everyone!  Only caveat:  Service was lacking.  Was seated immediately, which was a plus, but waiter took his time to serve us water, didn't say hello, not very pleasant(young guy).  Waitress that took the order, nice/friendly, but overwhelmed by the crowd(NYE during the day).  She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. Had to wave down someone to get us more water. Had to ask for the bill, then waited forever for her to bring it, then pick it up!  It's a small venue, the place was packed quickly, but it was surprisingly & refreshingly quiet.  We could actually hear ourselves in conversation!"
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/25/2009,$$,4,Joey’s,"Located in the middle of semi-gritty yet artsy design district, Joey's is a small 'upscale' yet laid-back Italian restaurant...perfect for a business lunch or simply a lunch date. Waiters in red are attentive and take initiative, we had breadcrumbs on our table and one of the bus boy wiped it clean so we could resume hand-fondling tabletop!  The bossman came by to make sure we are taken care of when the lunch crowd trickled in. Food was thoughtfully prepared. Soup of the day was mushroom soup (vegan, no cream used but still creamy. Pureed consistency), served with olive oil drizzled in a smiley face. I recommend eating it with the bread; feel free to ask for more if you run out! Papardelle with crabmeat and mushroom was creamy yet subtle. Trofie (little corkscrew pasta) with meat sauce - WIN! Portions were huge for lunch, there was leftovers for dinner!,Soup - $5,Entrees- $15 each,I would come back here if I am in the area...enjoy! ,Tip-bits:,Street parking available right outside Joey's,Lunch menu available with decent portions,Accommodations for big groups gladly made"

The portions are pretty big tho, so I would go on an empty stomach.  The dessert was not as great, however if your coming here you're more than likely coming for an arepa. The yuca fries are also very yummy! They also released that they have expanded their menu to include vegan options!! Very excited to check those out on my next visit!"
"7281 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/28/2017,$$,5,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"Amazing! Delicious food, great selection of wine/beers, accommodating to vegan/conscious eaters and the staff is very customer service oriented!

"28 NE 29th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/25/2017,$$,3,Morgan’s Restaurant,"Walking in the place looked really nice and cool. Did not appreciate having to wait in a line to be seated. Then it took a while for the server to even acknowledge that we were here and the service was good not great. My girlfriend really enjoyed the raspberry French toast, giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. My vegan burger was not great it was fine. Knowing that it is hard for most places to accommodate vegans is hard, but either way not many options to choose from and it was more mediocre than anything."
"223 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",5/28/2017,$$$,5,Alter Restaurant,"So, so good! We came here with friends and it was one of the best places we've eaten at in Miami. Most of our party was vegetarian and Alter had a wonderful vegetarian/vegan menu (the restaurant is tasting menu only - either 5 or 7 courses). ,Everything was super fresh and I like that they source everything locally so the menu is constantly changing and evolving. We didn't have to wait too long between courses which is nice so dinner didn't feel like a marathon. ,The presentation was beautiful and creative, it reminded me a bit of Alinea. ,I highly recommend and will definitely be going back!"

All other sides fall short and I wouldn't recommend ordering. Especially the Mac and cheese and vegan options - pretty bad. ,However if you want a great grilled cheese and fries this is the place!"
"7418 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/6/2017,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"Some of the best comfort food in Miami! As someone who loves cheese but has sworn off dairy, I appreciate their vegan cheese options. They also have gluten free options for all their sandwiches too. Try the short rib! It's my favorite."
"2601 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/20/2016,$$,3,Wynwood Diner,"After trying to find a good brunch spot in wynwood we finally decided to go to the wynwood diner, and it was a ok decision. The first thing they got wrong was either the name ""diner"" or the fact they only served like 6 items on Sunday  brunch... I'm.sorry but I come from Nyc and our diners have everything. On top of that, one of friends is vegan, and there was nothing on the menu for her. Not one healthy choice for brunch. It amazed me that a hipster diner would not have any vegan dishes... Hmmmm odd. Now for the positives, the décor was pretty cool... Rustic and raw walls and retro décor. The noise level was normal and it is good for families. The pancakes were actually very good, and so was the coffee. The only thing is I wish they would offer a bigger menu and not a set selected menu for Sunday's."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/8/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"The food at this restaurant is amazing. Even vegetarian and vegan eaters will be in heaven here. I've tried soup, rice, and noodle dishes that are all delicious. If you like spicy the kimchi soup is a must try. If you haven't been to this restaurant yet please don't wait..... its so much tastier than anything they sell at 1800 Lucky and the service is 1 million times better."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/11/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"This is the type of food that was missing in Midtown/Wynwood and I'm glad they have vegetarian and vegan options. I had the veggie dumplings, stir fry tofu and the japchae with veggies. All was excellent and tasty, will come back soon for the fried rice!"
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/28/2017,$$,5,Phuc Yea,"I'm in love with this place. Dripping in charm and style, amazing and adventurous food, and the best service I've had in years. Creative, delicious items- loved the rolls, papaya salad, riceless jambalaya and fab wine selection. caters to all kinds of eaters including Vegan. We booked the semi private room for a bday dinner, they were super accommodating and made our night so special and fantastic. Look out for James if you're lucky enough for him to be your server; felt more like a personal concierge for  dinner and drinks! The spaces are super special- lantern garden had a nice party going. This is sure to be our new go to spot."
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",10/2/2017,$$,4,Phuc Yea,The real question is when are they gonna start serving vegan ramen because I've been waiting forever. Spring rolls and everything I've had has been delicious.
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fuchai,"This place is small, intimate and offers Chinese and Korean food, with an emphasis on Korean. Fuchai is ideal for that moment when your taste buds cry out for intense and varied flavors. The portions are plentiful, they offer soups, salads and options for vegetarians and vegans. During our visit we saw many people who asked for food to take home."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/16/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,Great little mom n pop place - the food is amazing (see pictures attached). Is very small place so small groups (2-6) works best. They have some vegan vegetarian options. Not much of it but delicious

Steak and Pasta is a must when you go there, so vegans stay away. It's what the Brickell area needs. Yummy!"
"1435 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",2/27/2014,$$$,3,Edge Steak & Bar,Between 3-4 stars for overall experience and dishes. It was ok. We sat on the terrace for a group bday party. They are slow to bring out dishes. So it's a 3 hr dinner easily. For you Vegans- The clams were a bit overcooked. The flavor was pesto. Nice. The lobster soup was yummy.  Also had no dairy. The strawberry dessert was ok. Was enough for a few bites between two. I've had better at pastry shops. The ambiance on the terrace is bright even at 9 pm. The host claimed to have lost my friends reservation but it was empty- so I don't even know why they felt the need to tell her that story. The waiters were professional and nice. I guess if you want a quiet place for dinner this is ideal. Food Prices $10-34+. Drinks $14. Dessert $8. We enjoyed ourselves. The fire pits on the terrace seemed more fun than our table though.
"1435 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/7/2018,$$$,5,Edge Steak & Bar,Very nice environment and food was very good! Service was excellent. My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday and they were very flexible with making a vegan meal and made sure everyone enjoyed their food
"1453 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",8/1/2015,$$$,5,PM Fish & Steak House,"A vegan in a steakhouse? Well, let's just say, I didn't choose the place. I had a business dinner here, and when I found out PM was a notorious steakhouse,  I decided to embrace the experience.,Fortunately, it had some dishes that I easily ""veganized"".,For instance, I ordered their Madero salad, and I asked the waiter to nix the cheese. Did the same thing with their delicious baked mushrooms. So I was able to be a happy camper surrounded by happy carnivores.,By the way, this location it's exquisite. And the service, super top notch.,The down side, of course, it's the parking. Its Brickell, after all. Don't bother to look for one. Just valet your car, and enjoy dinner."

"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",4/29/2014,$$,4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,"This place is a great alternative to the narrow selections of restaurants at the Dade land mall. It's located on the 2nd floor of the new wing. The place is spacious, well lighted and modern looking. There's a big terrace outside and the bar area it's big also. The food selection is good and for all tastes from crab,ribs, chicken or even some vegan and Gluten free items.,The service it's OK it seems that they wanted pretty people to serve and not good servers. But they try. The portions are not big so if you are hungry order your own plate.,I loved the tuna cones, just delicios. The steak was OK. Previously we tried the ribs appetizer and were very salty."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",5/8/2018,$$,4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,"I have been here many times and my experience is always a little different depending on the time, area you choose to sit by and whose serving. Brunch is always a good idea, and the drinks are a highlight as well as the place in itself and atmosphere and the wait time is not that long. Every body working there looks is so pretty and young. Unfortunately there are very limited vegan/vegetarian menu items. Portions are decent. I come back here for fries, avocado toast (special order) and the mojitos and mules."

I went for my lunch break and will definitely be attending regularly. They also have great vegan options and a large menu. My favorite are the Hibiscus Flautas. I wish I would have taken more pictures, but was so eager to eat. Today I had the Chicken Flautas and the Elenita tacos. My friend had the brisket and steak tacos.Excellent! Coyo and Tacology have nothing on the flavors of Pilos!"
"28 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",6/25/2018,$$,5,Pilo’s Street Tacos,Food is AMAZING and the price is just right. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options makes me so happy. Service is very nice and pleasant. Most certainly will be back to this gem!
"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/1/2015,$$$,5,Area 31,"I never thought vegan dishes could taste as good as prepared in Area 31. Several dishes we're ordered and all were excellent. The sirloin my significant other ordered was so presentable that I tried a piece, well several pieces with no regrets. Such a plate can definitely tempt a vegan or vegetarian to cheat. Definitely prepared by an Executive Chef."
"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/11/2015,$$$,4,Area 31,"A go to restaurant if you are looking for a beautiful view and service. It was our first trip to Miami and we were looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary.

"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/1/2015,$$$,4,Area 31,"We had a great service and the food was extraordinary. Had different choices of salads and all of them were great. The fact that we try to eat vegan as much as possible, they did have variety. The food presentation was beautiful and the servers knew what was on your plate and would be able to provide you with details if asked. We totally recommend Area 31."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/19/2013,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"Clean, fast service, friendly staff. We found this place two weeks ago and have been back four times. The food is delicious and they even have an awesome sandwich for vegans. Not bad for a place that predominantly serves meat. This is really more like a sandwich joint than a fine dining experience, so don't bring a first date here unless they are Venezuelan, chilled out, and up for some great taste sensations."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/23/2016,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,This restaurant is always packed. They have a big TV which is nice to watch games. The prices are a little expensive for arepas...but the experience was great. They have vegan options and the beers are delicious.
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/11/2016,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"This place was yummy, although I only tried the arepa silvestre and a reina pepieda. The reina pepieda, looked like it had too much chicken and the silvestre was all vegan and delicious. I would definitely go back and try other arepas. The restaurant is very small and the service was honestly ok. The arepa was very nice and crispy. I honestly like la Latina in midtown much more. But I don't mind returning and giving it another try."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/29/2018,$$,5,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,Great spot! I loved the Vegan arepa! Super fresh and delish. They also allow dogs for outside seating. The server was very attentive and friendly!

The tapas selections did include several items that were already 'safe' but things like the fried chickpeas are served with ham so it was easy enough for them to serve a vegan version. The restaurant was a little loud but that's to be expected late on a Friday. The place was clean and romantic and trendy, perfect for an evening with friends or a date. My wine glass was dirty but our server replaced it quickly and with apologies as soon as I pointed it out. The service was good, the staff was pleasant and food arrived relatively quickly. The cava selection was great. I will be back for sure."

My boyfriend and I are both vegan and ordered the vegetarian pho and we were not disappointed. We both ordered medium sized bowls and it came out to be about $22 dollars. I was stuffed for at least five hours afterwards so I don't have any complaints. You can customize your pho to your liking with all the toppings and sauces they provided. Will definitely be coming back again! I love how close it is to my house! Can't wait to try their spring rolls next time! :)
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/23/2018,$$,4,Pho 79,"I have visited twice so far. I am very grateful that they serve vegetarian pho here. I found the soup to be very flavorful and filling. They serve 3 sizes (small, medium & large) and the prices are all reasonable. I have only tried this soup one other time in my life so I am not an expert on Pho. The service was very friendly and accommodating both times I have visited. They seem to get real busy on weekends so I have to try and go on a weekday. I was told that they are in the process of expanding their space and menu. Apparently they will be adding some more vegetarian/vegan items to the menu. They also have a bookcase with books that you are allowed to borrow and return once you are finished reading. Yes. I am a fan!"

"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/1/2018,$$,5,Pho 79,"Came here with some friends after two of them had raved about this spot. Not at all disappointed. I ordered the vegetarian pho and veggie/tofu spring rolls. Insanely good. The pho, for being vegetarian, still had very rich broth. The tofu and veggies in there were fresh and cooked in the broth; they weren't over cooked or soggy. It's one of those rare places that you eat at and already can't wait to go back. Honestly, it's a gem and I'm lucky it's relatively close to my house. My only detraction would be if you're vegan or vegetarian they don't have too many items to order but the ones they do, that I've tried at least, are absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to make it out here again. Also, true the taro boba tea, it blew us all away!"

The texture of the kale and grilled hearts of Palm were a great combo, and Whatever is in the sauce truly made it!  The arepa with queso blanco and black beans and the yucca fries were great too!"
"194 SE 1st Av, Miami, FL 33131",8/14/2016,$$,5,Ceviche Town,"Great service, delicious food, but food took a long time. Their chaufa was delicious, and ceviche yummy as well. Their mango and passion fruit juice was fresh as well! I didn't experience the full menu since I am vegan, but was still extremely happy with everything."
"1701 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33135",5/6/2018,$$,5,EDUKOS,"Came in here while looking for somewhere off the beaten path and was not let down. It's about a 15 min walk from the main drag on Calle Ocho, but it's worth it. The inside is cute and eclectic and the bartender/(I think) owner was super chill and nice. He gave us great suggestions on where to go in Miami and enjoy our stay. The food itself was blasting with flavor. I had the Jill's Salad, Taqueños, and the Garden Tacos and they were all amazing. Me and my partner are vegetarian and this place had so many veggie and vegan options, which was refreshing and surprising! A must have place. I really just wanted to take them back with me and keep this restaurant forever. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Miami."
"804 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/28/2015,$$,5,Eating House,"This place is perfection. You feel like you're in a cozy neighborhood eatery in Boston. They are a great group and there should be a place like this in every neighborhood in Miami. From Coral Gables, Pinecrest, South Miami on down. The food is DELICIOUS and creative! The staff is very friendly. Sometimes we even sit at the bar even though we have a table reservation. It's full service and makes for a wonderful evening of conversation. You don't feel like you're in Miami. I see some negative comments on here from people complaining of no Vegan choices. That should not justify giving this place two stars. It's some of the best food in Miami. If you are vegan then it's your responsibility to seek out those places that cater to your needs. Don't trash a place because they simply are who they are. It's not fair to them. They are really personable. The only constructive comment would be a tweak on the reservation proces.They want you to email them and they respond that way. That's tough sometimes when you are making plans and need an answer. Phone system would be best and would allow them to personally connect even more with customers. We will be back again and again. LOVE IT HERE!! I heard they are opening another place in the Grove soon. CAN'T WAIT!"
"1961 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",12/1/2016,$,4,Mi Rinconcito Mexicano,"It was pretty good food. I'm vegan and always looking for new places to eat and they had a large vegetarian selection. Chips and salsa were not my favorite but the veg gordita was great. ,I love the little bakery in the back. I was talking to the baker and she was telling me about the different items they have depending on which holiday is coming up. They had a lot of authentic sweets. ,I would definitely come here again."
"1510 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",4/21/2018,$$,5,El Exquisito,I came here once.  Had the best black bean soup in my life now it's the only place I return in Little Havana.  Finger licking good.  It's the place I bring all of my visiting guests.  The first time I came here they gave me a bowl of soup so large that I couldn't finish it.  I like that because I wanted it to be my entire meal since I'm a vegan with occasionally swinging vegetarian when I go out.
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",7/7/2018,$$,5,1-800-Lucky,Highly recommend the scallion and egg fried rice. Hands down best I've had. The veggie dumplings are just ok and there are a ton of other vegetarian options so I would probably skip those next time and go for a vegan poke bowl or vegetarian banh mi bowl.
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",4/9/2018,$$,5,1-800-Lucky,"Very fun place, food is good you have different options, you can find veggie /vegan options too. It gets crowded so it's sometimes hard to find a table. ,It gets a little noisy when it's full so I prefer going earlier, they open at 5 pm. ,Good option in Wynwood for dinner and they have the famous ice cream from Nyc"
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",3/16/2018,$$,4,1-800-Lucky,"Such a neat place. Thought it was a sit down restaurant but actually like 5-6 smaller to-go spots inside. Sushi and rice bowls in the middle dumpling and Vietnamese on one side and like a stir-fry on another side I forget the last one.  I got a pineapple Vegan poke bowl and veggie dumplings (both from different stands) and it was so great! The lines go fast. ,The hard part is finding a seat in the place.  We waited with our trays in have maybe 5 min till someone got up from a small 3x6 table and we squeezed 3 of us in there. ,They also have a bar and more space outside with a patio to mingle. ,Didn't give the 5th star because I thought there wasn't enough seating"
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",7/24/2018,$$,4,1-800-Lucky,"Darn I love this place! I love ramen, I can tell you that this place has some of the best ramen you'll find around. The restaurant looks like a mini asian food court and all of them have awesome dishes that can suit many palates. Vegan/veggies this place is for you too!,The place gets PACKED, so you'll have a game of musical chairs (don't take it literal). Finding sitting can become a mission, specially if you have a group of people. The place seems trendy,  it has an outdoor area with a bar. They have different types of music throughout the week. I heard they have Jazz nights at some point during the week. The place has good vibes! But don't take my word for it! Go and experience it yourself -- Yaaasss"
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/8/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,Love it... great options and flavors!!! One of the next for fast food and healthy options ... meat eaters or  vegan and vegetarian!!!
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/5/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"Went here for lunch.  The ingredients were fresh and the variety was large. They had many meat ootions as well as vegan, falafel.  The staff was extremely helpful being it was my first time. They also have organic sodas and housemade teas and juices. I would definitely recommend."
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/30/2017,$,4,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"This is my first time at this restaurant. Wadline was really helpful, he walk me through my order. They have great customer service, clean atmosphere, delicious food and they have vegan option . The only thing is that there's no parking only street parking. Besides that I will definitely come back again."
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/13/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"I love randomly stumbling upon restaurants. As many of us know, most restaurants downtown close around 5pm. I was in the area desperately looking for a restaurant that was open but also served vegan options. I eventually gave up and decided to walk to Whole Foods when I noticed Clove.,The restaurant looked inviting with its huge open windows and tasteful music. I quickly opened up yelp and saw the raving reviews. I immediately entered the restaurant because my belly was already angry with me for not feeding myself. ,I was reading over the menu figuring out how their system worked when a staff member almost immediately offered their assistance. You start with a base (bowl, salad, or pita), dips and spreads, proteins and veggies, then your toppings and dressing.,As a vegan, I had extra questions regarding the ingredients in some of the spreads. The employee was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful in assisting me with what to choose. I ordered a lentil bowl with red pepper hummus spread, falafel and veggies with all the toppings (vegan ones anyway). While it may sound like an odd combination it was absolutely delicious. It was flavorful, healthy, and VERY filling. I'm especially impressed with the falafel. I've been to other Mediterranean restaurants with a similar concept (like Zuuk) and haven't been in love with their falafel because they've lacked flavor and they're dry. Whatever Clove is doing- they're doing it right! ,As I was waiting for my food (the falafel was still being prepared) another person gave me a cup for a free sample of their drinks made in house. I believe she could've been the manager or owner because she had that vibe to her. Anyway, I had the pomegranate, apple and mint juice and it was to die for. ,She came back around to check on me to make sure I enjoyed my food. I don't know of any other casual restaurants that have such amazing customer service and it all felt very genuine too!,If you can't tell already by my raving review, I had an amazing experience from the food, to the staff, and the overall ambience. I'll definitely be coming back and recommend Clove to everyone!"
"200 S Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33131",5/12/2016,$$,3,Zest,Love the look and feel of this place but as a vegan there is nothing on the menu in the restaurant to eat without modification. The quick market is a great addition to the building for daytime but has only one menu item that is vegan friendly. The service is good and efficient but never delivered with a smile. I'm still a regular but it would be great if the staff were a bit more cheerful!
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/19/2016,$$,5,Bombay Darbar,"In my Thursday experience at the Bombay, I found the food superb and the service outstanding. A top tier restaurant, with a formal appearance, and crowded at 7 PM with locals, a bit loud, but a joyful loud. There is an outside patio on a very quite street.  The menu is perfect--food for the Vegans, Vegetarians, and carnivores. Everything we ordered was delicious--no take home by the end of the meal. (There is a good looking lunch menu I will be trying soon) Lunch and dinner are served, and the Bombay is closed in-between, check the times. I would travel out of my way to eat here in the future."
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/4/2018,$$,5,Bombay Darbar,"Everything, I mean every single thing was incredible. From the chutney to the main courses. Everyone at my table, which ranged from vegans to meat eaters was raving about the food. The staff, the ambience... thank you Bombay!"
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/28/2017,$$,3,Bombay Darbar,"It was date night so we wanted to go somewhere different. We arrived without reservations. There was a lot a people waiting to be seated so we opted to sit at the bar.  We ordered the vegan items they had on the menu. The lentil, rice Bryani vegetarian and the wheat bread. Everything was delicious, spiced accordingly, presentable and served on a timely manner. ,Im giving them 3 stars based on ,1. The disorganization of the hostess. ,2. Rushed bar service ,Im the type of person that would like some type of explanation about the menu. Not just come in and take my order. The bartender was alone in the bar. She was overwhelmed and running and screaming around bar. We know every item they bar ran out of now!  ,We were rushed to order and when asked about some explanation about a particular item it was like pulling teeth. She was in an out not very hospitable. Kinda felt like a hospital ER."
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/18/2018,$$,4,Bombay Darbar,"I love eating at Bombay.  Everything is delicious and they will always assist me in making their vegetarian dishes vegan.  I have been coming here since they were just a tiny closet next to the Cruz Building.   Even though they moved to a huge location on Florida Ave, they still get slammed, especially for holidays.  So make a reservation.  ,I only have one issue with Darbar.  Upon one visit, we watched as the manager belittled a server in front of our table.  I watched him schmooze guests, then talk to his staff member like she was worthless.  It was written all over her face that she was hurt by his words and the humiliation. I was in the service industry for 14 years and things like that really make my blood boil."
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/29/2018,$$,5,Bombay Darbar,"The food here is DELICIOUS! Great Indian food plenty of options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike. We also had the samosas which were very tasty. The serving sizes are huge and you really get what you pay for. The Chana Masala has my heart! My mom really enjoyed the Mango Lassi."
