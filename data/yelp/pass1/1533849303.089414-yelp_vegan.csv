"7418 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/28/2015,$$,3,Ms Cheezious,"Grilled (cheese) sandwiches and fries are the only thing worth trying here. All other sides fall short and I wouldn't recommend ordering. Especially the Mac and cheese and vegan options - pretty bad. ,However if you want a great grilled cheese and fries this is the place!"
"7418 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/6/2017,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"Some of the best comfort food in Miami! As someone who loves cheese but has sworn off dairy, I appreciate their vegan cheese options. They also have gluten free options for all their sandwiches too. Try the short rib! It's my favorite."
"2601 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/20/2016,$$,3,Wynwood Diner,"After trying to find a good brunch spot in wynwood we finally decided to go to the wynwood diner, and it was a ok decision. The first thing they got wrong was either the name ""diner"" or the fact they only served like 6 items on Sunday  brunch... I'm.sorry but I come from Nyc and our diners have everything. On top of that, one of friends is vegan, and there was nothing on the menu for her. Not one healthy choice for brunch. It amazed me that a hipster diner would not have any vegan dishes... Hmmmm odd. Now for the positives, the décor was pretty cool... Rustic and raw walls and retro décor. The noise level was normal and it is good for families. The pancakes were actually very good, and so was the coffee. The only thing is I wish they would offer a bigger menu and not a set selected menu for Sunday's."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/8/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"The food at this restaurant is amazing. Even vegetarian and vegan eaters will be in heaven here. I've tried soup, rice, and noodle dishes that are all delicious. If you like spicy the kimchi soup is a must try. If you haven't been to this restaurant yet please don't wait..... its so much tastier than anything they sell at 1800 Lucky and the service is 1 million times better."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/11/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"This is the type of food that was missing in Midtown/Wynwood and I'm glad they have vegetarian and vegan options. I had the veggie dumplings, stir fry tofu and the japchae with veggies. All was excellent and tasty, will come back soon for the fried rice!"
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/28/2017,$$,5,Phuc Yea,"I'm in love with this place. Dripping in charm and style, amazing and adventurous food, and the best service I've had in years. Creative, delicious items- loved the rolls, papaya salad, riceless jambalaya and fab wine selection. caters to all kinds of eaters including Vegan. We booked the semi private room for a bday dinner, they were super accommodating and made our night so special and fantastic. Look out for James if you're lucky enough for him to be your server; felt more like a personal concierge for  dinner and drinks! The spaces are super special- lantern garden had a nice party going. This is sure to be our new go to spot."
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",10/2/2017,$$,4,Phuc Yea,The real question is when are they gonna start serving vegan ramen because I've been waiting forever. Spring rolls and everything I've had has been delicious.
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fuchai,"This place is small, intimate and offers Chinese and Korean food, with an emphasis on Korean. Fuchai is ideal for that moment when your taste buds cry out for intense and varied flavors. The portions are plentiful, they offer soups, salads and options for vegetarians and vegans. During our visit we saw many people who asked for food to take home."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/16/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,Great little mom n pop place - the food is amazing (see pictures attached). Is very small place so small groups (2-6) works best. They have some vegan vegetarian options. Not much of it but delicious
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/22/2018,$$,5,Phuc Yea,"Damn this place is good!!! (Didn't even have time to take a picture we inhaled it so fast! lol) Vegan options, gluten free options, even zero calorie noodles!! All the flavors were amazing! Would definitely recommend and come back again!"
"7100 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/8/2018,$$,4,Phuc Yea,My first time for lunch at pho mi. Our food was very good and fresh. I had the the vegan soup bowl and spring rolls and banh mi baby. Atmosphere was good and the music was perfect. Portions were perfect. A little more than I planned on spending for lunch. Definitely going back.
"28 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",3/4/2018,$$,5,Pilo’s Street Tacos,Way better than Coyo Taco or anything nearby. Great meat and meatless options! Vegan friendly and the tacos are very good. Staff was helpful and very kind.
"177 Southwest 7th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/27/2009,$$,4,Graziano’s in Brickell,"I've been here for dinner and for a couple of events. The food was superb and the wine selection was excellent. Steak and Pasta is a must when you go there, so vegans stay away. It's what the Brickell area needs. Yummy!"
"1435 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",2/27/2014,$$$,3,Edge Steak & Bar,Between 3-4 stars for overall experience and dishes. It was ok. We sat on the terrace for a group bday party. They are slow to bring out dishes. So it's a 3 hr dinner easily. For you Vegans- The clams were a bit overcooked. The flavor was pesto. Nice. The lobster soup was yummy.  Also had no dairy. The strawberry dessert was ok. Was enough for a few bites between two. I've had better at pastry shops. The ambiance on the terrace is bright even at 9 pm. The host claimed to have lost my friends reservation but it was empty- so I don't even know why they felt the need to tell her that story. The waiters were professional and nice. I guess if you want a quiet place for dinner this is ideal. Food Prices $10-34+. Drinks $14. Dessert $8. We enjoyed ourselves. The fire pits on the terrace seemed more fun than our table though.
"1435 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/7/2018,$$$,5,Edge Steak & Bar,Very nice environment and food was very good! Service was excellent. My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday and they were very flexible with making a vegan meal and made sure everyone enjoyed their food
"1453 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",8/1/2015,$$$,5,PM Fish & Steak House,"A vegan in a steakhouse? Well, let's just say, I didn't choose the place. I had a business dinner here, and when I found out PM was a notorious steakhouse,  I decided to embrace the experience.,Fortunately, it had some dishes that I easily ""veganized"".,For instance, I ordered their Madero salad, and I asked the waiter to nix the cheese. Did the same thing with their delicious baked mushrooms. So I was able to be a happy camper surrounded by happy carnivores.,By the way, this location it's exquisite. And the service, super top notch.,The down side, of course, it's the parking. Its Brickell, after all. Don't bother to look for one. Just valet your car, and enjoy dinner."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",3/20/2017,$$,5,Earls Kitchen + Bar,GREAT EVERYTHING! The moscow mule is to absolutely die for.. and lets not even begin on the vegan dishes. Just wow!
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",4/29/2014,$$,4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,"This place is a great alternative to the narrow selections of restaurants at the Dade land mall. It's located on the 2nd floor of the new wing. The place is spacious, well lighted and modern looking. There's a big terrace outside and the bar area it's big also. The food selection is good and for all tastes from crab,ribs, chicken or even some vegan and Gluten free items.,The service it's OK it seems that they wanted pretty people to serve and not good servers. But they try. The portions are not big so if you are hungry order your own plate.,I loved the tuna cones, just delicios. The steak was OK. Previously we tried the ribs appetizer and were very salty."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",5/8/2018,$$,4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,"I have been here many times and my experience is always a little different depending on the time, area you choose to sit by and whose serving. Brunch is always a good idea, and the drinks are a highlight as well as the place in itself and atmosphere and the wait time is not that long. Every body working there looks is so pretty and young. Unfortunately there are very limited vegan/vegetarian menu items. Portions are decent. I come back here for fries, avocado toast (special order) and the mojitos and mules."
"2711 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/11/2017,$$,5,NOA Cafe,"Cozy cute little place with delicious and homemade food. Where else can you get pad thai and a mezze platter at the same time?  Vegan friendly. So good!! Great service, coming again 100%"
"28 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",11/15/2017,$$,5,Pilo’s Street Tacos,"Pilos Street tacos is authentic Mexican food. The food is excellent and the staff are friendly and helpful. I went for my lunch break and will definitely be attending regularly. They also have great vegan options and a large menu. My favorite are the Hibiscus Flautas. I wish I would have taken more pictures, but was so eager to eat. Today I had the Chicken Flautas and the Elenita tacos. My friend had the brisket and steak tacos.Excellent! Coyo and Tacology have nothing on the flavors of Pilos!"
"28 SW 11th St, Miami, FL 33130",6/25/2018,$$,5,Pilo’s Street Tacos,Food is AMAZING and the price is just right. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options makes me so happy. Service is very nice and pleasant. Most certainly will be back to this gem!
"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/1/2015,$$$,5,Area 31,"I never thought vegan dishes could taste as good as prepared in Area 31. Several dishes we're ordered and all were excellent. The sirloin my significant other ordered was so presentable that I tried a piece, well several pieces with no regrets. Such a plate can definitely tempt a vegan or vegetarian to cheat. Definitely prepared by an Executive Chef."
"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/11/2015,$$$,4,Area 31,"A go to restaurant if you are looking for a beautiful view and service. It was our first trip to Miami and we were looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary. Place became very handy with service provided by Susann (one of our server), she was nice and pretty helpful to get a delicious vegan bite for my wife. ,Definitely yes !"
"270 Biscayne Boulevard Way, Miami, FL 33131",7/1/2015,$$$,4,Area 31,"We had a great service and the food was extraordinary. Had different choices of salads and all of them were great. The fact that we try to eat vegan as much as possible, they did have variety. The food presentation was beautiful and the servers knew what was on your plate and would be able to provide you with details if asked. We totally recommend Area 31."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/19/2013,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"Clean, fast service, friendly staff. We found this place two weeks ago and have been back four times. The food is delicious and they even have an awesome sandwich for vegans. Not bad for a place that predominantly serves meat. This is really more like a sandwich joint than a fine dining experience, so don't bring a first date here unless they are Venezuelan, chilled out, and up for some great taste sensations."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",6/23/2016,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,This restaurant is always packed. They have a big TV which is nice to watch games. The prices are a little expensive for arepas...but the experience was great. They have vegan options and the beers are delicious.
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",8/11/2016,$$,4,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,"This place was yummy, although I only tried the arepa silvestre and a reina pepieda. The reina pepieda, looked like it had too much chicken and the silvestre was all vegan and delicious. I would definitely go back and try other arepas. The restaurant is very small and the service was honestly ok. The arepa was very nice and crispy. I honestly like la Latina in midtown much more. But I don't mind returning and giving it another try."
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",4/29/2018,$$,5,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,Great spot! I loved the Vegan arepa! Super fresh and delish. They also allow dogs for outside seating. The server was very attentive and friendly!
"1246 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",11/1/2017,$$,5,Doggi’s Arepa Bar,I exclusively go here for the cachapa or as we call them in colombia - arepa last de choclo. Back in the days before I became a vegan it was one of the best places for tequeños.
"3105 Commodore Plz, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",7/24/2018,$$,5,Lulu,I was there on Monday or Tuesday doesn't matter it was great! they have a nice vegan menu! shout out to Maria great service and delicious food!  def going back! with all my friends
"2101 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",10/29/2012,$$,4,Xixón Spanish Restaurant,"The kitchen was very willing to work with me to get me food that was both gluten-free and vegan. The tapas selections did include several items that were already 'safe' but things like the fried chickpeas are served with ham so it was easy enough for them to serve a vegan version. The restaurant was a little loud but that's to be expected late on a Friday. The place was clean and romantic and trendy, perfect for an evening with friends or a date. My wine glass was dirty but our server replaced it quickly and with apologies as soon as I pointed it out. The service was good, the staff was pleasant and food arrived relatively quickly. The cava selection was great. I will be back for sure."
"2101 SW 22nd St, Miami, FL 33145",12/27/2017,$$,4,Xixón Spanish Restaurant,"Solid choice for authentic Spanish food between Coral Gables and downtown Miami area.  I actually rated them a 4, my dinner guests rated it a 5 star experience.  Tapas here are nicely sized, nicely priced and the taste aspect is well above average.  Gazpacho is extremely good.  Service was consistent, professional and efficient.  Unique desserts make this one a very interesting choice, including fried milk.  Sangria here was a true gem and they feature a happy hour certainly worth visiting.  Nice restaurant overall with available valet parking or street parking.  Menu choices here almost felt endless and if you are a vegan or vegetarian you will be covered.  It's one of the better Spanish restaurants that I have had in Miami and one that should impress."
"3399 NW 72nd Ave, Miami, FL 33122",5/14/2018,$$,5,Bocas Grill,"Great experience , came from boca house due to an extended wait time. Staff was super friendly and courteous accommodated our party of 12 right away. Camila our server was superb . Food was wonderful and even super diverse for our vegan and vegetarian family members . More than exceeded our expectations we will definitely be back . My daughter really enjoyed her 11 year bday celebration thanks to Bocas Grill . We are super grateful ! Great job guys !"
"333 SE 2nd St, Miami, FL 33131",7/24/2016,$$,5,Farfalle,"Amazing food! Amazing service! My new fave Italian place. I had date night and we were late and the waiter over heard us and expedited the order so we could make it on time. We were so surprised to see our food come out so quickly. Everyone was so attentive and welcoming. From the bus boy to the bartender and the manager. Awesome date night experience. Also, they accommodated to my vegan requests!"
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/19/2018,$$,5,Pho 79,Went in on a Sunday morning and was seated right away and brought waters. My boyfriend and I are both vegan and ordered the vegetarian pho and we were not disappointed. We both ordered medium sized bowls and it came out to be about $22 dollars. I was stuffed for at least five hours afterwards so I don't have any complaints. You can customize your pho to your liking with all the toppings and sauces they provided. Will definitely be coming back again! I love how close it is to my house! Can't wait to try their spring rolls next time! :)
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",4/23/2018,$$,4,Pho 79,"I have visited twice so far. I am very grateful that they serve vegetarian pho here. I found the soup to be very flavorful and filling. They serve 3 sizes (small, medium & large) and the prices are all reasonable. I have only tried this soup one other time in my life so I am not an expert on Pho. The service was very friendly and accommodating both times I have visited. They seem to get real busy on weekends so I have to try and go on a weekday. I was told that they are in the process of expanding their space and menu. Apparently they will be adding some more vegetarian/vegan items to the menu. They also have a bookcase with books that you are allowed to borrow and return once you are finished reading. Yes. I am a fan!"
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",1/6/2018,$$,5,Pho 79,"Delicious foods that is located in the same plaza of our business. They offer  variety of Vietnamese dishes, noodle soups, drinks and desserts from ph, bún bò Hu,  bún tht nng ch giò, rice plates with your choice of Vietnamese BBQs, vegan options, iced coffee with or without milk (cà phê sa đá), fresh-squeezed lemonade, fresh-squeezed orange juice, soy milk, coconut juice, smoothies and chè, etc."
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/1/2018,$$,5,Pho 79,"Came here with some friends after two of them had raved about this spot. Not at all disappointed. I ordered the vegetarian pho and veggie/tofu spring rolls. Insanely good. The pho, for being vegetarian, still had very rich broth. The tofu and veggies in there were fresh and cooked in the broth; they weren't over cooked or soggy. It's one of those rare places that you eat at and already can't wait to go back. Honestly, it's a gem and I'm lucky it's relatively close to my house. My only detraction would be if you're vegan or vegetarian they don't have too many items to order but the ones they do, that I've tried at least, are absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to make it out here again. Also, true the taro boba tea, it blew us all away!"
"1415 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",3/1/2018,$$,5,Pho 79,"Best pho in florida , have books in mindfulness. Plenty of vegan & vegetarian dishes."
"1701 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33135",11/25/2017,$$,5,EDUKOS,Best place I've ever eaten in Miami. If I didn't live far I would go at least once a week. Great service and great food! Tons of Vegan/Vegetarian options as well. EAT AT EDUKOS!
"1701 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33135",3/3/2018,$$,5,EDUKOS,"The garden arepa is fantastic, delicious and vegan! The texture of the kale and grilled hearts of Palm were a great combo, and Whatever is in the sauce truly made it!  The arepa with queso blanco and black beans and the yucca fries were great too!"
"194 SE 1st Av, Miami, FL 33131",8/14/2016,$$,5,Ceviche Town,"Great service, delicious food, but food took a long time. Their chaufa was delicious, and ceviche yummy as well. Their mango and passion fruit juice was fresh as well! I didn't experience the full menu since I am vegan, but was still extremely happy with everything."
"1701 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33135",5/6/2018,$$,5,EDUKOS,"Came in here while looking for somewhere off the beaten path and was not let down. It's about a 15 min walk from the main drag on Calle Ocho, but it's worth it. The inside is cute and eclectic and the bartender/(I think) owner was super chill and nice. He gave us great suggestions on where to go in Miami and enjoy our stay. The food itself was blasting with flavor. I had the Jill's Salad, Taqueños, and the Garden Tacos and they were all amazing. Me and my partner are vegetarian and this place had so many veggie and vegan options, which was refreshing and surprising! A must have place. I really just wanted to take them back with me and keep this restaurant forever. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Miami."
"804 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/28/2015,$$,5,Eating House,"This place is perfection. You feel like you're in a cozy neighborhood eatery in Boston. They are a great group and there should be a place like this in every neighborhood in Miami. From Coral Gables, Pinecrest, South Miami on down. The food is DELICIOUS and creative! The staff is very friendly. Sometimes we even sit at the bar even though we have a table reservation. It's full service and makes for a wonderful evening of conversation. You don't feel like you're in Miami. I see some negative comments on here from people complaining of no Vegan choices. That should not justify giving this place two stars. It's some of the best food in Miami. If you are vegan then it's your responsibility to seek out those places that cater to your needs. Don't trash a place because they simply are who they are. It's not fair to them. They are really personable. The only constructive comment would be a tweak on the reservation proces.They want you to email them and they respond that way. That's tough sometimes when you are making plans and need an answer. Phone system would be best and would allow them to personally connect even more with customers. We will be back again and again. LOVE IT HERE!! I heard they are opening another place in the Grove soon. CAN'T WAIT!"
"1961 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",12/1/2016,$,4,Mi Rinconcito Mexicano,"It was pretty good food. I'm vegan and always looking for new places to eat and they had a large vegetarian selection. Chips and salsa were not my favorite but the veg gordita was great. ,I love the little bakery in the back. I was talking to the baker and she was telling me about the different items they have depending on which holiday is coming up. They had a lot of authentic sweets. ,I would definitely come here again."
"1510 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",4/21/2018,$$,5,El Exquisito,I came here once.  Had the best black bean soup in my life now it's the only place I return in Little Havana.  Finger licking good.  It's the place I bring all of my visiting guests.  The first time I came here they gave me a bowl of soup so large that I couldn't finish it.  I like that because I wanted it to be my entire meal since I'm a vegan with occasionally swinging vegetarian when I go out.
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",7/7/2018,$$,5,1-800-Lucky,Highly recommend the scallion and egg fried rice. Hands down best I've had. The veggie dumplings are just ok and there are a ton of other vegetarian options so I would probably skip those next time and go for a vegan poke bowl or vegetarian banh mi bowl.
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",4/9/2018,$$,5,1-800-Lucky,"Very fun place, food is good you have different options, you can find veggie /vegan options too. It gets crowded so it's sometimes hard to find a table. ,It gets a little noisy when it's full so I prefer going earlier, they open at 5 pm. ,Good option in Wynwood for dinner and they have the famous ice cream from Nyc"
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",3/16/2018,$$,4,1-800-Lucky,"Such a neat place. Thought it was a sit down restaurant but actually like 5-6 smaller to-go spots inside. Sushi and rice bowls in the middle dumpling and Vietnamese on one side and like a stir-fry on another side I forget the last one.  I got a pineapple Vegan poke bowl and veggie dumplings (both from different stands) and it was so great! The lines go fast. ,The hard part is finding a seat in the place.  We waited with our trays in have maybe 5 min till someone got up from a small 3x6 table and we squeezed 3 of us in there. ,They also have a bar and more space outside with a patio to mingle. ,Didn't give the 5th star because I thought there wasn't enough seating"
"143 NW 23rd St, Miami, FL 33127",7/24/2018,$$,4,1-800-Lucky,"Darn I love this place! I love ramen, I can tell you that this place has some of the best ramen you'll find around. The restaurant looks like a mini asian food court and all of them have awesome dishes that can suit many palates. Vegan/veggies this place is for you too!,The place gets PACKED, so you'll have a game of musical chairs (don't take it literal). Finding sitting can become a mission, specially if you have a group of people. The place seems trendy,  it has an outdoor area with a bar. They have different types of music throughout the week. I heard they have Jazz nights at some point during the week. The place has good vibes! But don't take my word for it! Go and experience it yourself -- Yaaasss"
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/8/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,Love it... great options and flavors!!! One of the next for fast food and healthy options ... meat eaters or  vegan and vegetarian!!!
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",3/5/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"Went here for lunch.  The ingredients were fresh and the variety was large. They had many meat ootions as well as vegan, falafel.  The staff was extremely helpful being it was my first time. They also have organic sodas and housemade teas and juices. I would definitely recommend."
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",4/30/2017,$,4,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"This is my first time at this restaurant. Wadline was really helpful, he walk me through my order. They have great customer service, clean atmosphere, delicious food and they have vegan option . The only thing is that there's no parking only street parking. Besides that I will definitely come back again."
"195 SE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33131",1/13/2017,$,5,Clove Mediterranean Kitchen,"I love randomly stumbling upon restaurants. As many of us know, most restaurants downtown close around 5pm. I was in the area desperately looking for a restaurant that was open but also served vegan options. I eventually gave up and decided to walk to Whole Foods when I noticed Clove.,The restaurant looked inviting with its huge open windows and tasteful music. I quickly opened up yelp and saw the raving reviews. I immediately entered the restaurant because my belly was already angry with me for not feeding myself. ,I was reading over the menu figuring out how their system worked when a staff member almost immediately offered their assistance. You start with a base (bowl, salad, or pita), dips and spreads, proteins and veggies, then your toppings and dressing.,As a vegan, I had extra questions regarding the ingredients in some of the spreads. The employee was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful in assisting me with what to choose. I ordered a lentil bowl with red pepper hummus spread, falafel and veggies with all the toppings (vegan ones anyway). While it may sound like an odd combination it was absolutely delicious. It was flavorful, healthy, and VERY filling. I'm especially impressed with the falafel. I've been to other Mediterranean restaurants with a similar concept (like Zuuk) and haven't been in love with their falafel because they've lacked flavor and they're dry. Whatever Clove is doing- they're doing it right! ,As I was waiting for my food (the falafel was still being prepared) another person gave me a cup for a free sample of their drinks made in house. I believe she could've been the manager or owner because she had that vibe to her. Anyway, I had the pomegranate, apple and mint juice and it was to die for. ,She came back around to check on me to make sure I enjoyed my food. I don't know of any other casual restaurants that have such amazing customer service and it all felt very genuine too!,If you can't tell already by my raving review, I had an amazing experience from the food, to the staff, and the overall ambience. I'll definitely be coming back and recommend Clove to everyone!"
"200 S Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33131",5/12/2016,$$,3,Zest,Love the look and feel of this place but as a vegan there is nothing on the menu in the restaurant to eat without modification. The quick market is a great addition to the building for daytime but has only one menu item that is vegan friendly. The service is good and efficient but never delivered with a smile. I'm still a regular but it would be great if the staff were a bit more cheerful!
"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/19/2016,$$,5,Bombay Darbar,"In my Thursday experience at the Bombay, I found the food superb and the service outstanding. A top tier restaurant, with a formal appearance, and crowded at 7 PM with locals, a bit loud, but a joyful loud. There is an outside patio on a very quite street.  The menu is perfect--food for the Vegans, Vegetarians, and carnivores. Everything we ordered was delicious--no take home by the end of the meal. (There is a good looking lunch menu I will be trying soon) Lunch and dinner are served, and the Bombay is closed in-between, check the times. I would travel out of my way to eat here in the future."

"2901 Florida Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/28/2017,$$,3,Bombay Darbar,"It was date night so we wanted to go somewhere different. We arrived without reservations. There was a lot a people waiting to be seated so we opted to sit at the bar.  We ordered the vegan items they had on the menu. The lentil, rice Bryani vegetarian and the wheat bread. Everything was delicious, spiced accordingly, presentable and served on a timely manner. ,Im giving them 3 stars based on ,1. The disorganization of the hostess. ,2. Rushed bar service ,Im the type of person that would like some type of explanation about the menu. Not just come in and take my order. The bartender was alone in the bar. She was overwhelmed and running and screaming around bar. We know every item they bar ran out of now!  ,We were rushed to order and when asked about some explanation about a particular item it was like pulling teeth. She was in an out not very hospitable. Kinda felt like a hospital ER."

I was in the service industry for 14 years and things like that really make my blood boil."

We also had the samosas which were very tasty. The serving sizes are huge and you really get what you pay for. The Chana Masala has my heart! My mom really enjoyed the Mango Lassi."
