"3235 NW 32nd Ave, Miami, FL 33142",3/13/2018,$$,5,Taqueria Los Dos Amigos 2,"This is a review I was reluctant to write. I didn't want to write it because this is a hidden jewel, and if I write about it, it won't be hidden anymore. I'll tell how I found this gem. I was selling a piece of restaurant equipment that the owner purchased, but prior to the purchase I asked the owner what was his intention for the equipment because I used it in my house. He tells me it's for his Mexican restaurant. I tell him great I love mexican food and where is his restaurant. So after the purchase he gives me the address and I tell him I'll visit one day, Thank you and good night. Well one day was the very next day. Now on to the food. The fresh made guacamole was delicious with the homemade tortillas chips to start. Next I'm vegan so I had the Spanish rice with beans and sliced avocados which was equally just as delicious and to wash it down a Mexican Pina soda, lastly the prices are on point. The food was so good I went back the next day. I didn't post any pictures, you'll have to go and see for yourself. maybe I'll be able to keep it a hidden gem."
"40 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33132",3/28/2018,$$,5,Notso Tokyo,Great food and great service! AND multiple VEGAN options. Yes please! The decor is great with old school video games and anime as the theme. They have arcade games to play for FREE. I would definitely recommend this place! My favorite option on the menu so far was the ginger kissed salad. Looking forward to tying the curry next time!
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/10/2016,$,5,Diced,This restaurant had great food.  Everything was very fresh. Lots of options were available for those that are vegan or vegetarian.  They didn't have a line during lunch hour.
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",8/30/2016,$,5,Diced,"What a wonderful little Gem! I had a delicious chicken bowl with quinoa and all the trimmings. Had it with their signature sauce that includes 3 types of sauces including guava...omg, I couldn't stop eating. All veggies were fresh and place is very clean. They even have vegan option choices. Totally recommend it to anyone that would want a tasty and healthy meal!"
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",5/11/2016,$,5,Diced,"Found out about this little spot at a bootcamp event that they were kind enough to be a part of for autism awareness. They pride themselves in serving healthy food so I didn't feel guilty eating this after an intense workout. The man who was serving the food recommended a vegan sauce he had just created a couple of days before, along with a guava sauce -they were both DIVINE. They were nice enough to give me seconds since the portions were really small & also provided me with a shirt of theirs. I went to the actual restaurant a couple of days later & was welcomed in by the same guy who had recommended the sauces. The staff was very attentive & the food was even better the second time around. Will deff be going back soon."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/3/2017,$,5,Diced,"Food was great, healthy and with vegan options. The service was also great.   My husband and I both had a steak bowl to our liking. It was fast and not expensive option for dinner. The only down fall we had was when we walked in the restaurant smelled like cigarettes.  Almost lost my appetite.  It seemed like maybe the staff took a quick cigarette break inside near the corner..... it's a small restaurant so the smell travels.   Luckily it didn't linger and the food and service made up for it.   Would definitely come back again ....!!!!  Minus the cigarette smell......."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",9/15/2017,$,5,Diced,Honestly such a great place and it's vegan friendly! Their staff is very friendly and work pretty fast. The place is always packed and my order is always made quickly and all of their dressings have a vegan option.
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",6/24/2017,$,5,Diced,Had the bowl with chicken and it was delicious  I will make sure to come back. They have vegan choices!
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",3/15/2018,$,5,Diced,"We have been hearing about this place for some time and we thought why not go one day, this is now our top place to go eat lunch every now and then. Not only is it healthy but it's sooo filling and I love that ! You can ask for extra at no cost. They also have vegan options which is great !! They have never failed me. The bowls are deep so it maybe seem like little but it really isn't. This is definitely my to go place for fast healthy food."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",7/16/2017,$,5,Diced,"Where has Diced been all my life? The diced staff was amazing, they are very lively and upbeat. I'm a vegetarian and the menu had great vegetable selections. I got the vegetable bowl, with brown rice and all the toppings, including avocados. The next thing they ask you is which sauce, and let me tell you all the sauces are amazing. I love that they had vegan sauces as well. I got all 3 sauces on top of my bowl.  The spicy guava is my favorite.The portion sizes are very well, I could not finish my bowl but my friend did. We both left extremely satisfied with all the fresh toppings and filling bowl. Would recommend this place as they are a very healthy fast food option. And I confess... I couldn't leave without buying the sauces to take home...lol"
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",10/4/2017,$,4,Diced,"This place is perfect if you are on the go and need something fast but healthy.  It reminded me a little of chipotle in that the menu is simple.  You just pick your protein, the add-ins and the sauce.  The sauces are the best part and they also have vegan sauces to choose from!"
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",12/6/2013,$$,3,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I really don't understand the hype with this spot, aside from the beautiful setting. We went for breakfast on a Sunday and ordered the garden omelette, homemade bread, coffee, and juice. The omelette had zero flavor- and we eat tons of vegetarian and vegan foods to know that vegetables don't have to be bland. The bread tasted like something you can buy pre-made at the grocery store, but it was made better by the delicious jam they served it with. On the upside it really does feel like you're sitting in a garden and it smells so good of plants and flowers. Our server was quick and friendly so no complaints there, either. I haven't hit up too many other spots in the Grove but there are much better places in Coral Gables for breakfast and brunch."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",2/15/2015,$$,4,Peacock Garden Bistro,"Food quality and allergy/gluten/lifestyle (vegetarian/vegan) friendly menu: 2.20 stars. Service: .80 star (close to 1 full star). Atmosphere: 1 full star (in fact, I might even in throw another .25 star, for the outdoor seating on a beautiful Miami day is priceless). My recommendations would be: for the price, I'd like to see this restaurant offer some higher quality foods (i.e. wild, free range, grassfed, organic) and beef up your the gluten sensitive, and add some vegan options. Overall great spot, in a great location, with some very tasty cuisine."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",3/28/2014,$$,4,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I was here for a wedding reception, so we were treated very well.  We didn't get the full menu of options since I'm sure the bride and groom had to choose a pre-made package, which unfortunately didn't include any vegan or even vegetarian options.  However, since our orders were also taken at the table (not just via our RSVP), I was able to get the corn soup appetizer (they claimed it had no chicken/beef/etc broth) and vegan risotto as my main meal.,The corn soup was absolutely delicious; it was a good level of sweet: not too subtle but not overbearing, either.  The only thing bad about it was the dish it came in was basically a plate (not completely flat, of course, but shallow), so there was much less soup than expected.,The vegan risotto unfortunately was topped with grated cheese, but I was able to skim that off to the side.  I'd only had a bite or two of risotto before this and didn't recall whether I'd liked it or not, but this one was pretty decent.  It had some veggies mixed in, but the one I remember is the mushrooms (I love mushrooms!).,I'd prefer that they would have had a larger vegan selection (I'm pretty sure their full menu has more option that could at least be modded to be vegan, so this might have simply been due to restrictions on the pre-made party package).  However, the risotto at least showed they'd put effort into it.,We started out at the cocktail bar, which had some couches and single lounge chairs, as well as a piano.  It was a bit crowded with our party, but it seemed to have some flair.,The room in which we sat for dinner was very large and full of round tables for party guests, and there was also some space for dancing by the DJ.  There was a small upper level with large windows that went unused, but the windows allowed in some sunshine.,Parking was available in a garage underneath the restaurant.  Unfortunately, the garage is cash only, but there is an ATM right next to the garage entrance (which you should visit *before* exiting).  I believe it was around $5-10 for the 3-4 hours we were there, but you'll want to double-check.,There was some street parking, as well, but I'm not sure what the rates were, and I wouldn't count on finding a free spot, depending on when you go.  There was another parking garage about two blocks away; again, not sure the  rates.,Lastly, there definitely was some eye candy among the staff (not that that's reason alone to go!)."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",8/7/2018,$,4,Diced,"Love this place! Went for my first time and the food was amazing. It's great that they have veggie options for vegetarians or vegans while also having meat options. The pinto beans were amazing, and I loved their garlic cilantro sauce as well."
"2342 Sw 67th Ave, West Miami, FL 33156",7/17/2018,$,5,Diced,"I. Love. This. Place. Sometimes I will get food here 3 days in a row, no shame. I love that they have options that cater to my dietary restrictions (dairy-free). I love their vegan tomato basil sauce and their vegan pesto cilantro sauce as well. The more the merrier! They are fresh, quick, and tasty. Definitely recommend :)"
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",4/23/2018,$$,5,Peacock Garden Bistro,"I went to Peacock Garden Cafe several times for lunch/dinner while I was looking at wedding venues in the area. The service and food was so great, I choose to have our rehearsal dinner here. I'm so glad I did. All of my guests loved the food. The chef was also accommodating to my guests who were vegan/vegetarian. We had our own private area for the rehearsal dinner and designated server. I also considered them to be reasonably priced for full experience we got."
"2889 McFarlane Rd, Coconut Grove, FL 33133",7/3/2018,$$,5,Peacock Garden Bistro,"This is the second time I've worked with the Peacock Garden Cafe for a company luncheon - and Ismelda and her staff always deliver!  The large banquet room is perfect for hosting a party for 65-80 people. The staff were very pleasant and helpful as we set up the room an hour in advance of the banquet.  The wait staff constantly worked the room to ensure drinks were filled for the 2 hours we were there. There are several lunch packages that will satisfy meat, fish and vegan eaters and although basic (potatoes, salads, etc) they create the  most savory side offerings. Deliciously seasoned chicken breasts and salmon filets that are not overcooked are not the easiest dishes to master on two buffet lines,  but the chef in the kitchen managed to pull it off without a hitch. Both were moist and flavorful and again, deliciously seasoned.  The most notable side dish of all, which received rave reviews across the board is their ""creamed spinach"" dish.  Truly freshly made with real heavy cream and whole leaves of spinach kept disappearing off the plates and into people's mouths. It was not surprising to hear people say ""I'm going back for seconds!""  Key lime pie and brownie sundae were the perfect dessert to end a very satisfying meal. Overall, If you're looking for a venue that can accommodate a large crowd and that specializes in delicious home style cooking flavors and substance, the Peacock is a great choice (and this is not a paid review!)."
"2001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",9/18/2016,$$,5,The Daily Creative Food,"I lived around the corner from this place for six years, and I'm just NOW writing the five-star review that it deserves! It's super busy (as always), but they never fail to accommodate my dietary restrictions. I got the Lifeguard wrap and veganized it by substituting the egg whites for grilled tofu and eliminated the Swiss. It was super flavorful and I highly recommend it! Also, the staff made a special almond milk frozen mocha (with Ghirardelli chocolate--yum!), which should definitely make its way on the menu. In the neighborhood? Come here for brunch. It's a must!"
"2001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/29/2017,$$,5,The Daily Creative Food,"Excellent customer service for picky vegans! Great staff & manager :) I had the asian wrap with no chicken, carrot ginger soup, and green tea freeze with almond milk - all very yummy!"
"350 NW 8th Ave, Miami, FL 33128",11/26/2017,$$,4,Miami River Cafe,"Vegetarian and Vegan options found here ,Homemade tortillas always steal my heart, and theirs are on point. Delicious!,Homemade salsas and beans. Elotes (street fair corn on the cob) are a must and Margaritas were also so good at only $4 bucks. Chill atmosphere with Latin music playing, which is always a plus, in my opinion ;). Thumbs up and be back, for sure!"
"6900 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/6/2015,$$,3,Via Verdi Miami,The only thing that does not involved cheese here are salads!! Very limiting menu fro vegetarians an vegans. The ambiance is good and red wine bynthe glass too
"6900 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/29/2016,$$,5,Via Verdi Miami,"Nice vegan options and a green outdoor patio. I arrived late on a weekday night and they were very kind to offer a delicious vegan kale salad with apples, walnuts and a mustard vinaigrette along with the yummy chickpea dip served with sliced cherry tomatoes and Italian  crisp bread.,The interior resembles a movie set from Goodfellas or the Godfather - a place that you may overhear someone murmuring  about the whole cannoli or where they stashed the loot.,The patio is really nice surrounded by vines which buffer the noise from Biscayne Blvd and they have a cute gourmet food shop with homemade sauces. Viva Verde!"
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/2/2016,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"One of the best meals I have had in months. This was a spectacular dining experience! Every dish was beautifully prepared and presented.  The flavors, presentation and variety in the menu satisfied our party of diverse eaters. I eat vegetarian and vegan and there were many options and everyone loved them. The ricotta, figs, beets was outstanding, the cauliflower, pumpkin gnocchi incredible with a balanced wine list and a great value. Its worth stopping in to try if you are in Miami."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/2/2018,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"What a great place to bring a large group of people too. We were eight people and we sat in this large booth. The cocktails were amazing and there was a variety of food options for all the dietary restrictions in the family (vegan, among them). The service was also very great. I find that sometimes big groups get ignored, but our waitress was very attentive."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/28/2017,$$,3,Beaker & Gray,"I feel like this place could be so much better if they catered to others who have specific dietary needs. Out of all of the food that was available in the menu, I found it really lacked in terms of vegan and vegetarian options. I was only able to eat one thing out of the entire menu that had well over 20 things and I found that to be disappointing.  On top of that, the place was ridiculously overpriced for food that wasn't quite filling. ,I highly recommend that if you want to come here, you come purely for their drinks as that seemed to be the only thing that I really enjoyed out of this entire experience. ,Also, even though our server was willingly trying to be attentive to my dietary needs, he still ended up messing up my order for when I asked for specific things to be taken out of one of the things in the menu that I ordered. This was the cauliflower that came with bacon and the fact that not even that tasked could be done, made me reluctant to ever return. ,You'd think that this place would be more up and coming and cater to everyone as it's Wynwood but it wasn't. ,However, my mom and my boyfriend enjoyed their meals and I really liked the ambience of the place since it brought something romantic so it's great if you have the money to spend on an expensive date or a place to go with family that came from out of town."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/26/2016,$$,5,The Spillover,Vegan crab cakes!!!!! Delicious!!!! Guava cake and tres leches desert is amazing. They even have a dog menu. I love it!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/18/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,This place was great! Great service and the food was amazing. The vegan crab cake was so tasty. Highly recommended.
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Love cauliflower buffalo, vegan crab cakes, awesome kombucha. Hidden gem. My favorite in coconut grove."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",5/1/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Great restaurant!! I was wowed when I first went, and when I went again! The Vegan Crab Cakes had me at first taste. And the Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer, ooof. The service is great, the vibe is great, and yep, so is the food. You definitely want to go here at least once. Your tummy deserves it. :)"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/25/2016,$$,4,The Spillover,"Came here based on reviews before realizing it was mainly seafood. I opted for vegan crab cakes which were basically over-seasoned veggie patties, and too spicy to enjoy. Others in my party had the lamb burger which was ok and the lobster Reuben which seemed to be a hit. Would have given this 3 stars but beer selection is great, service was fair, and decor was creative. Definitely worth a try."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/23/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Lovely ambience and excellent service. The music takes one back to various eras so if you're open to oldies and jazz like music then this place is a no brainer. I had the vegan crab cake with a side of cauliflower mash and an appetizer of fried conch, both orders were extremely tasteful. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafoods or drinks."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/27/2017,$$,3,The Spillover,"My carnivorous family loved their meal, but unfortunately I am a vegan. Oddly enough, the only vegan sandwich option used honey in the sauce and in the making of the bread. While I am sure the bread and sauce were delicious I do not eat honey and felt mislead by browsing the menu online before trying this place. However, the waitress was very helpful and lovely."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,Yum! The vegan crab cake sandwich is my favorite. Throw in some sweet potatoes fries and it's a home run. Try the ciders they are refreshing!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/2/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"So many good options on the menu. Before I went vegan I tried the buffalo cauliflower (appetizer), pan con minuta, the burger and deserts. None of it disappointed. Passed by today and had the vegan crab cakes, they were pretty satisfying! Our server was great as always. Check this place out."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/9/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Another fabulous eatery from the Lokal restaurant group. Although I don't quite get the theme of the spillover, the food did not disappoint! I enjoyed a savory vegan ""crab cake"" sandwich with a side of grilled mushrooms. I also tried the gator BBQ ribs which were also great. ,The guava bread pudding really hit the spot with guava marmalade oozing out of it. ,I'll definitely return to try more dishes."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/20/2018,$$,4,The Spillover,"Great happy hour with good food and great beer. Lovely to sit outside with our pooches. The vegan burger is so delicious. As were the buffalo cauliflower and snapper bites. Austin, our waiter, was very attentive. I've come a few times and this was the best experience so far. This is not a ""fancy"" place with ""fancy"" food. Just good stuff excited well for a good price. Can't beat that..."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/25/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Really great restaurant!! I went with my family a few weeks ago and celebrated my birthday and we were all really impressed. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather that evening. There's an amazing selection of ciders, beers, and mead to choose from. My mom, who never drinks, found a nice Swedish pear cider that she really liked. My family shared the fish dip as an appetizer and all had high praises. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and absolutely loved it!! The menu also said there were more vegan and gluten free options available for those with dietary restrictions. We finished the meal with some guava bread pudding and chocolate cake which the family really enjoyed. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in coconut grove!"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2018,$$,3,The Spillover,"The restaurant has a lot of cool and funky decorations that give it a very unique feel. Spillover is a seafood restaurant that also has a wide variety of other menu options, and even some exotic options such as gator ribs. In addition they also offer vegan, and also dog friendly menu options. I came here a couple of weeks ago and ordered the jambalaya, while it was flavorful the sausage and chicken were quite dry, and there was barely any shrimp in the giant portion. While it was tasty the quality of the meat was quite disappointing. However, the bread that it came with was very delicious, and the meal was plated very beautiful. One warning is that they will charge you a dollar for water since they use a fancy filter to filter it. Based on the other great reviews my experience here may have possibly been a fluke, and The Spillover may be worth trying again."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/22/2018,$$,5,The Spillover,"Such an amazing place! Small/medium intimate space that seems like a gem of a find. Decided to try it based off yelp reviews & thankfully, I was not disappointed. I ordered the veggie pasta and shrimp. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a great one. Such a light, healthy feeling meal but still fulfilling. Even the simple toast on the side complimented the sauce of the pasta. Would definitely recommend, plus they have vegetarian and vegan options."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/31/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Came here with the bf for a Friday night date and we had a great time! We got there around 7:30 and there was a wait so we decided to sit at the bar. Vanessa was a super great bartender and server. She took great care of us and gave us enough attention without making us feel constantly watched. The buffalo cauliflower was really yummy and a great appetizer. We also were  treated to the fish dip due to a delay in our food. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but the bf liked it ok. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and I loved it! Great flavors and texture and the 50/50 fries go perfectly with it. My bf ordered the lobster reuben and claims it's ""his most favorite sandwich ever"" so we will definitely be coming back again! Overall I had a really nice meal and can't wait to come back to try out more of the menu!"
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",9/7/2011,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,"A very trendy and new age type place! This place could please even the pickiest of eaters with their wide array of dishes anywhere from simple lunch burgers to complex vessels of fresh ingredients. Vegetarians, meat lovers and even vegans will have some big decisions to make on dishes to try. TRUST ME, coming from someone who knows that restaurant in and out; it is a wonderful place to be. There are many regulars who will attest to that! Make sure to make a reservation if you're coming on Thursday, Friday or Saturday and especially if you have a party of five or more. Brunch on Saturday and Sunday contains the Canes' classics with some additional breakfast items. They are more than accommodating for large parties as well with a pre-fix menu they can help you arrange. The happy hour is a STEAL~amazing fresh drinks that taste as if you're getting your daily fruit value with a buzz! I recommend ordering for the table during your first experience so everyone gets a taste and can decide for themselves what they prefer. The staff at sugarcane are extremely knowledgeable and well prepared! If you find yourself to be an indecisive person, simply give you're server an idea of what intrigues you and they can make a phenomenal experience of dishes for you! Overall, this place is a Miami encounter you must have! AND, do not leave without trying the french toast desert even if only for a bite ;)"
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/2/2012,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,Wow! Sometimes through complete dumb luck you luck out. It was my husbands bday. We had tix to a Heat game and wanted to have dinner in Miami before driving home to Boca. The Miami boat show was going on and it was Presidants Day weekend. I was striking out on all places in SoBe. So via Opentable I found Sugarcane. The reviews were good but I was clueless. It is in a very cool new area called Midtown Miami. I am from Atlanta and this area is reminiscent of Atl. The restaurant is very  Cuban old world looking. The big drawback is the very small tables and chairs. Neither my hubby or me are big at all but it was uncomfortable. We had excellent cocktails and wine. They have a menu of about 50 rums. Some are very small batch and hard to find.  Nice. We enjoyed 6 small plates. The plates were so delicious and the selection was extensive. I am vegan and my hubby is meat all the way. We were able to have it all! Please give this place a try you will not be sorry. We will definitely go back
"3252 NE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/2/2018,$$$,5,SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill,"Every experience i have had at Sugarcane was a pleasure! The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxing and sophisticated! I have a specific vegan lifestyle i like to follow and the manager Marcelo went out of his way to give me options! He was also very friendly and inviting! He also was very accommodating when i showed up for my birthday with a friend! Highly recommend Sugarcane and the management/servers excelled my expectations! 5 stars all the way"
"3404 North Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/7/2014,$$,4,Prohibition Restaurant and Speakeasy,"Pros: Great food, service, and scene. Mix of new world and old world music. Good mix of people. Great place to grab drinks with friends and order a bunch of small plates to share. I am vegan and even though the menu is not vegan friendly, they were able to accommodate me, which was greatly appreciated. ,Cons: On the smaller side. Gets loud for conversation. Single bathroom."
"3404 North Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/19/2015,$$,4,Prohibition Restaurant and Speakeasy,I took my boyfriend here in July for his birthday. I like restaurants with a little noise and full of energy and this was it. We were late for our reservations but they added us back on the list. It was a much longer wait and when we got seated it was at a bar type counter with stools right in front of the kitchen. It was nice with the man playing the saxaphone. The food was good and nice portions for the appetizers. I had pita with hummus and guacamole with plantain chips to share. Being vegan that was pretty much my meal because it was so filling. After we ate we went upstairs where they played music with a small dance floor. It was not my style they DJ played Spanish music the entire time. It would have been nice to have a mix of current music that is why I deducted a star.
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2016,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,"Delicious, fresh and simple yet flavorful dishes. Had the vegan risotto, organic carrots out of this world ! Service was very good. Limited wine selection by the glass. But good choices for draft beers. Will definitely be back."
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/13/2016,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,"Excellent food and amazing service in a fun,casual setting. Outstanding octopus and loved the vegan cauliflower soup. Ceviche was very well-balanced instead of the very acidic style at many restaurants. Definitely will come back to this place soon!"
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/23/2017,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,knew their vegan stuff and my non-vegan friends completely feasted! Wonderful place for everyone to dine :)
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2018,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,Bohemian meets neighbourhood joint meets young and sassy.  I ordered the impossible vegan burger and it was impressive in look and taste.  My mom had the pulled pork sandwich and she responded favourably to it.  This is not a normal menu item by the way.  Service here is friendly but I found it to be a bit inconsistent.  Ice tea is good but not to be charging $4.50 for it.  The restaurant has limited inside only seating so always a good idea to get a table reservation before arriving.  There is some parking around the building but it is rather limited as well.  All in all it lives up to the 4 star and higher rating for a casual restaurant and any place that plays Pass the Dutchie is alright in my book.
"210 NE 18th St, Miami, FL 33132",8/5/2015,$$$,4,Mignonette,"Extensive menu focusing on seafood. They had 8 different types oysters to choose from. We opted for the chefs choice and they were excellent. The red fish was excellent as well for my main course. Although a seafood dominated menu, they were able to accommodate our vegan friend with the vegetable platter. Service was good, not great."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2015,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Two girlfriends took me to my favorite restaurant, Michael's Genuine, yesterday for my birthday. Lunch was fabulous!  We ordered hominy and falafel to snack on, yum. One is vegan and enjoyed the falafel wrap. Me and the other shared the butter lettuce salad with grilled steak and a bottle of Sauvignon blanc. For dessert we devoured the pot de cream, and Rosemary doughnuts. WOW, ROSEMARY DOUGHNUTS!!!!! Incredible. Can't wait to go go back :)"
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/14/2013,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"I have been waiting to dine at Michael's for quite some time now, so we stopped in for a drink at the bar, the dinner menu would have proved tough for two vegans.  ,After propping ourselves up on the chairs, we ordered the Cabarete and Ginger-Lemongrass Homemade Soda, and the bartender went straight to work. Both were deliciously well-crafted, and we started feeling a bit of envy that we were unable to stay for dinner, or, all night for that matter. Sigh. ,The over-all experience seemed much more expensive than the bill actually was, and the atmosphere, was indescribably un-Miami, Miami. ,For a few minutes we feel transported else where, then, the parking meter ran out."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2016,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Went here this morning. Sunday breakfast. Open earlier than most restaurants in the area. Very unique menu, absolutely delicious food. Everyone loved everything, but very small portions which the waiter did tell us from the get-go. Also, I do wish there were a few more vegetarian or vegan options. With such a creative and unique menu, I'm sure they can come up with something. I will be back though."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/18/2018,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,Been coming here for years.  Always wonderful.  The staff is so helpful and nice.  They are always accommodating for vegan dishes.  Great atmosphere.  I don't attempt brunch anymore because it is so packed.  But I love coming for an early dinner.
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",9/13/2015,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Hidden Gem! T&T is literally tucked away in a housing complex in Kendall. It has a hip Wynwood feel with affordable and delicious mexican fare. Vegan and Vegetarian options are available. Service is fantastic! It actually feels like the entire staff has stock in this place. They personally want you to have a wonderful experience. I predict another location opening in the near future.
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/12/2015,$$,3,Tacos & Tattoos,"Vegan customer here with a tip for management:,Tell the chef that the tofu and mushrooms need more seasoning, and that the portion sizes are ridiculously scanty. ,That being said, the service is phenomenal and the decor is super hip. ,Hip is a great word to describe this place."
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/30/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Just recently went vegan and the tofu tacos here are BOMB ! They're my go to order and they're very accommodating to my dietary needs ! The restaurant itself is very nice the ambiance is somewhat underground and hipster. The staff is so friendly I can't really say enough nice things about their waiters and how friendly they are I will definitely be going back for more tofu tacos !
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",12/10/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"Great music, amazing atmosphere, extensive menu, vegan and veggie friendly, can bring the kiddies and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more! Did I mention a lotta bang for your buck?"
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",5/5/2018,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"A cool little spot in Kendall.The food tastes fresh and you can tell there are experienced people or a chef is involved in the kitchen. There is a nice kick that I enjoy in almost everything, so beware if you are of a sensitive palate. Their fresh salsa is one of my absolute favorites. Used to visit more frequently before going Vegan, wish they had more plant based options, and or specific veggie items on their menu. Other than that, my entire family loves this place and it is a staple for our dinner celebrations."
"270 Biscayne Blvd Way, Miami, FL 33131",12/28/2013,$$$$,4,Zuma,"Came here around 6:15 and got seated within a couple of minute. Really nicely decorated inside. I am vegan and I love mushrooms but the items with mushroom in them had butter so I had to request it grilled sans the butter and they did just that. I got the Mushroom salad which was $15. I guess that is an ok price because usually mushroom dishes are more pricey. I also got the Eggplant robata which had this velvety texture almost like fish. It was really tasty. The only downside to the restaurant that I can spot would be that we came at 6:15pm and they told us we have the table until 8pm but the service felt very like rushed. The waiter seemed to want to take our order and just get it in as well as the other staff. Also, the dishes were not huge, I did not happen to be too hungry so I was satisfied but on a regular day I would probably order another vegetable from the robata list."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/20/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"GreenStreet Cafe is a good crowd pleaser. They've got something for everyone, even someone who is vegan and gluten-free. There are enough items on the menu for a vegan who is also sans gluten not to feel too boxed in by limited options. We went for breakfast so this will color this review. The potatoes are fried in peanut oil so they're 'safe', The generous fruit plate and melon plates are also a good choice. The tomato, grits, oatmeal with cranberries or raisins and museli to the same tune were also lovely. They didn't have soy milk for the coffee (they normally do and their soy lattes are AMAZING!) but the coffee was still great. Omnivore friends said their eggs were ""perfect"". The omelete also seemed to please.The service was fast which is typical. We didn't have to wait for a table of 4 which per past experience is a little unusual. Everything was clean and done simply but well. I wouldn't go for myself but it's a good restaurant for groups with mixed dietary needs."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/10/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"I am in a hard place. Wahhh! This place was good but quite pricy. I wanna give 3/5 stars because of the pricing, but I think that's silly of me because touristy areas are not going to be cheeeeeap :3 I'macheapladymeep! ANYWAY, the food makes it worth a 4/5. I love that they give you some sort of spicy baresque peanut mixture before you get your food. Yum! Swallow that stuff up! I ordered a veggie pizza that was vegan (cheeseless :D) without having to ask. The hostess asked me!!! (Do you want cheese? Nay!) I was glad to have that option. ^.^ It was a really good sized pizza! Nice place... open late... yay & yay! : )"
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",8/15/2014,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The best choice for a Grove sidewalk seat, we love this place.  Our cheerful server, Justin, was more than helpful with vegan modifications.  Fig salad - no cheese - perfect balance of flavors, not overdone.  As always, it was AWESOME."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,We love Greenstreet! We come here every weekend for brunch. It's dog friendly and the food is great. We came here today to celebrate a birthday and we had the best time. Our server Andre was phenomenal. Always ready with a drink or menu recommendation and his quick wit. Both vegans and meat lovers were happy. Come see for yourself!
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/11/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"I always enjoyed this place before becoming vegan. Since going back, I really enjoyed their oatmeal (one of the best I've had). I had side of the potatoes, which have always been my favorite!! And a bowl of fruit, which were all fresh and delicious. If you're vegan, I wouldn't worry too much. They have more of a selection than other places and it's good quality."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The vibe is very intimate and cozy. The server was very attentive. My sister is a raw vegan and asked for a salad with a side of avocados but when she started eating the salad she noticed it had feta cheese. The server (Ricky, I think his name was) replace the salad right away with and gave her another side of avocados with no charge. He recommended the Penne Tetrazzini and it was delicious! I finally tried the Nutella filled French toast that I always see on Instagram and one word, AMAZING! ,Everything was great, next time I'll definitely come around to try their brunch!"
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",8/25/2015,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wow! This place is awesome. I came for a birthday dinner with my girls. Each of us with some weird eating habit. 1 vegan, 1 gluten free, and 1 allergic to fish. This place was able to cater to ALL 3. This is what we all ordered and loved it!!!!! Vegan - Fried corn with no butter; portobello mushroom sandwich with extra chips and avocado, and lychee sangria. Gluten Free - Lemonade, baked bbq chicken with veggies. No Fish - BBQ Pork Burritos, sangria and key lime pie. We were stuffed and so happy. BUT, the best part was our waiter KIAH!!! Once he heard about our weird habits, he confirmed with the chef at the start of the meal what we could all eat. And if he didn't know then we made sure to find out. He was so funny and personable. He didn't try to pretend to know the menu, he really knew it and would ask questions if he didn't. We didn't feel neglected or bombarded. If you have a chance then take a seat with KIAH!!! I will definitely come back"
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",5/9/2016,$$,4,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Delicious comfort food, without the pretentiousness of many restaurants of this level. My compliments to the chef, who made every effort to accommodate my daughter's newly adopted vegan lifestyle. The service was good, actually really good. We were a party of 10, and everything came out at a reasonable time. This place is always packed, and worth the wait. The pan roasted Brussels sprouts are amazing with that green goddess dressing. Don't miss the fried green tomatoes and the fried chicken."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",7/9/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Away from the beaten path yet accessible from Sunset Drive and Red Road quietly sits Whisk Gourmet Good and Catering in South Miami. Fun restaurant with reasonable prices (not ""gourmet"" prices). First we were greeted by a warm woman whose smile was contagious, handing us a bowl with 2 homemade lemon poppy muffins (freshly made, moist, not too sweet which is a biggie for me and a hint of lemon, perfect), our server was a friendly gentleman who was always mindful without being intrusive. Our food was spectacular AND Frank X. Pulles had his favorite,  Low Country Shrimp and Gritts. Coffee was beyond exceptional and the OJ tasted fresh squeezed.  Yum. Starting TONIGHT I go back to my Vegan foods, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",11/1/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wowwww. The salads here are to die for. Such fresh and clean food. Felt so healthy. They have a lot of gluten and vegan free options which is good. The fried green tomato was just perfect. The salad portions were decent. The creamy corn was actually my favorite. I thought everything at this place was great. The service was good, and the waiters were nice. Definitely recommend"
"90 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",12/17/2014,$$,5,Vero,"We are so happy to find this restaurant in our area. The owners are so friendly and accommodating. The chef is obviously passionate about his food and when we brought friends who are vegans, his dishes were creatively thought out and well executed. Paula at front of house is the perfect compliment to this establishment with her personality and friendliness. Quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in Miami."
"90 SE 1st St, Miami, FL 33131",3/15/2017,$$,5,Vero,Great food and great service. The waitress offered vegan options which was nice. Only problem really was that it was in a sketchy location.
"1731 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",3/14/2017,$$,3,Lung Yai Thai Tapas,"I was in the neighborhood looking for Asian restaurants, I read the reviews stating that they had vegetarian options so I stopped in. It is a small thai open kitchen with counter seating and a smaller adjacent dining area. I was greeted promptly by a lovely thai server. I told her I was interested in vegetarian options and I was sadly disappointed. Every entree has fish sauce in it so I opted for the spring rolls and crispy mushrooms. The food was good but I really wanted AUTHENTIC Thai food, not ""snacks"".  I would have given this 5 stars but not having many vegan/vegetarian options is why I'm giving 3. I recommend going here if you eat meat. Also they will not seat you until your whole party is there, so get there together and be prepared to wait."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/22/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere and open kitchen. Service was great too. We had a rice pot (vegetarian not vegan) and it was delicious and big. It was packed on a Thursday for lunch, so best get reservation."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/4/2014,$$,4,Kush,"The selection of beer here is excellent, the staff is very knowledgable and go out of their way to make sure I have a great experience. The food, however is lacking in vegetarian/vegan options. All I can really eat there is the black bean burger, which is delicious, but I'd like to have more of a variety. I know they have a veggie meatball dish but the tomato soup they put it in is NOT veggie friendly. I made the mistake of ordering it and then being told they put beef broth in it. Whoever is in charge of that....vegetarians/vegans will not eat it because it has BEEF BROTH and meat eaters won't eat it because it doesn't have MEAT....think about it. ,Anyway, I definitely recommend this place to any beer aficionado or someone who enjoys some delicious treats. The cooks know what they're doing but PLEASE get more veggie options. I promise you will have more guests coming in."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Great hangover spot or great place to get a hangover! Excellent burgers and conch salad and the fries....to die for. A friend usually gets the vegan option and now they have salads but that isn't what I go there to eat.  They also make homemade honey mustard which is perfect to dip the fries in. The space is small so expect to wait or sit really close to others...Beer options are great, lots of local options and they always have a revolving selection too so ask your server what they recommend. I've never been disappointed with their choices."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2016,$$,5,Kush,"I found this restaurant here on Yelp. We chose this restaurant first because of the location as we were taking photos with all the colorful walls wynwood has to offer. Second I am vegan so I always try to find a place that has some options for me as well as my meat eating friends. Third the ratings and reviews for this place are amazing, and i now know why. This resultant was not fancy but it was welcoming and fun.. Lots of beer to choose from..The food was over the top amazing. I got the black bean burger and sweet potato fries I had no complaints it was so good.. Others in the party had hamburgers and the gator tacos. The hamburgers, I'm told were cooked to perfection and the tacos were the best ever. I will recommend this place from now on and will definitely  be visiting again."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/2/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Friendly fast working staff and very knowledgable about the menu and beers they had on draft. So excited to Come back to cool environment. A must see place, the vibe is dope and so is the staff. The food was impeccable. I'm vegan and Sonnie my server was very accommodating. What a blast and good time Stephanie the bartender was as well. I'm not only really into food I also happen to be from newyork so having that attentive confident service was a A+ for me. Try there homemade hot sauce its the taste your craving. Literally writing this review on the way there again. See you there yelpers"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Their Vegan Jambalaya was spicy and all sorts of good!!!!  I would go there every day for that Jambalaya.  The free parking after 4 is extremely helpful too.  Went during a weekday, so the wait was not bad at all."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/29/2016,$$,3,Kush,"Sister was visiting home and chose to go here. We were a large party and they accommodated us quickly outside. They are known for their beer selection, but I didn't have any. I highly recommend the alligator bites... delicious! We also ordered the vegan jambalaya and the chicken and waffles. The jambalaya had a nice kick to it. I also tried the frita burger and it was yummy. Overall a good experience."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2015,$$,5,Kush,"Just a small jaunt from Wynwood areas, my friend and I hiked here during after seeing some amazing grafitti. Her, being a vegan, makes it a little more challenging to find a good food spot. Often times, servers won't know what vegan even means and would add or bring dairy. She called ahead to ask about a few specifics on the menu before our journey to a very helpful person. We arrived to a busy and smaller restuarant, our first good sign of what was to come! ( also appeared to be filled with hipsters mixed with business attire- clues to a good local spot! ) We sat on perimeter bar top. The decor, very urban sheik yet casual. Grafitti/ street art theme throughout. The had a nice selection of draft beers to start. The waitress was immediately pleasant and recognized/ made mention of my girlfriends call earlier. I decided on a burger, The Rita. Gueyre cheese, bacon, potato sticks and guava jelly on a perfectly cooked Patty. My mouth died and went to heaven! Yum. Loved the ""Kush"" burned into my bun top. My girlfriend did the black bean burger with guacamole and was equally  impressed. Just writing this I wanna go back! Try this place! It's great... You might have to squeeze in cause its busy, but for good reason!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/28/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Such a spot! Cozy, friendly, fast service, awesome varieties of food and beer. If you are around, visit it. Also good for vegans. Ask for Jambalaya. Freaking awesome taste. Portion is right enough if you not super starving but local IPA will complicate it. ,Seasoning of food is crazy, spicy, rich on flavor... real comfort vegan food. No bs and sprouts. Quality is way better compare to other vegan places."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,3,Kush,"Meh. Impressive beer selection, and I liked the sour brown I had, but food and service left a lot to be desired. I'm vegan, and I made that pretty clear when I asked about the challah bun, but then the lettuce-wrapped veggie burger came out with cheese, and our appetizer didn't come out at all. Server was totally nice, just busy and thus inattentive. ,The thing I liked most about the place was the bathroom door (see photo) and the fat that Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was playing on the TV."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2014,$$,5,Kush,"I'd recommend the Johnny Utah, but I'm dying to get several other menu items. It's easily vegan friendly. Sides are all flavorful- asparagus is my favorite. There will absolutely be a beer on draft you'll love. ,They have quality... And variety of quality. ,It's always busy now, but worth it. Large portions, decent prices. First come first serve at the bar. A few picnic benches outside."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/31/2017,$$,5,Kush,"The vegan jambalaya is a revelation. Seriously, vegans and non-vegans alike will absolutely love it. Perfect flavor, just the right amount of spice and fills you up! Service is great and so is the ambiance. Definitely visiting Kush again anytime I'm in the Wynwood area!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/26/2017,$$,4,Kush,"Let's start with the positive..so last time my bf and I came here it was delicious we both left in heaven! This time, there was about a 45 minute wait and we were told to go 3 doors down to the right; there was a separate waiting room with games and drinks. As we enter, the vibe in this waiting room is cool, so we play Jenga. About 35 minutes later, we are seated and immediately order the Guac and chips! App came out super fast! Then for entree I ordered the vegan jambalaya and my bf ordered a burger; I didn't like my jambalaya..maybe it is because I don't eat meat and the texture was weird or there was too much? But my other half really enjoyed his burger. Dessert was excellent though, we had the jon dough with no ice cream. The manager went above and beyond to check and make sure the dessert was vegan and helped me out so much! Overall, we will be back, I just won't get that item. The food comes out really fast which is a plus! Also, everyone was really nice to us!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,As a vegan and going to a beer and Burger joint of course my choice is very limited but there is something for me.  I've ended up there many times with fiends and they love it and what if it was enjoyable. The beers are great and always come out satisfied
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/23/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Kush. We come here Wednesday night, after work,  two hours before closing, just lookin for some grub. We order: black bean burger and the vegan jambalaya, no drinks, just water. Service was great, food was great, and it wasn't too hot outside. Also highlight of our meal was when Blister in The Sun came on. What really bugged me and is making me write this review is what happened after we paid... ,Tipping is important. This is something I know well, because I'm also a server. I had a pretty great experience tonight, in fact, all of my experiences at kush have been great, but the attitude I received tonight made me super uncomfortable. I didn't have much cash on me, I had just enough to pay the bill, and a couple cents to tip. I had 3 measly dollars left in the bank and I thought to myself, well why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?,So I did it. ,waitress comes back to pick up receipts and change and walks away with a bitter look, TURNS AROUND to ask if there was something wrong with service to which we replied ""no"", and we looked really confused and shook and she actually looked down at the change, questioning it again and just walked away leaving us staring at each other in disbelief. Honestly just felt like such a degrading experience. She made us feel really bad about ourselves. I felt very judged and I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible to avoid the awkwardness she had created. A tip is a tip, right? we tried."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/30/2017,$$,5,Kush,Always great service and food. Have been multiple times with my boyfriend and to bring friends from out of town. Always a decent beer selection as well! Not only a place for meat eaters - great selection of vegetarian and vegans options. I always go for the alligator bites which is something cool to share with friends who don't live here. The menu is always changing but can definitely say I haven't had something I didn't like.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/22/2017,$$,5,Kush,"This place is awesome! Me and my husband have been here twice, this first time I ordered a salad and he ordered the chicken and waffles and gator bites! The salad was not a basic salad the lettuce and toppings were grilled and gave it an amazing flavor we both cleaned our plates.. and for Deseret we had the Brownie which was okay, but i wouldn't get it a second time and if I could recommend that they heat the growing up next time bc it was a very basic brownie lol. The second time I got a vegan jumbalya it was to die for!!! Even if you're not vegan you will love it! Even if you hate tofu which I do, you will love it in this dish! And my husband got a burger which he said was delicious. I eat more on the healthy side my husband not so much s going here there was options to satisfy both of us... OH! And the bathroom is define super cool! Check it out lol."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/19/2017,$$,5,Kush,The black bean burger was amazing! We also has the vegan ice cream which is made locally and so creamy and delicious you would never even know it's dairy free. The atmosphere was very laos back with the music choice and that's 70's show playing there was plenty of vibes going on. I'll definitely be returning.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,"As a non meat eater I'm obsessed with their vegan rice and seitan dish- amazing! Service is great, super dog friendly, just wish they had more space because wait times are usually pretty long!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,4,Kush,I'm OBSESSED with the vegan jambalaya....wish they had more vegan options but even so I keep going back for the one dish they make that I can have! Love the beer selections. Cool vibes. Great location.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/2/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Farm to table... Great food, great atmosphere and they have a waiting room. The veggie burger is bar none. No pun intended.. this is a must visit.. veggie/vegan friendly.."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/12/2018,$$,5,Kush,This place is great! They actually had a vegan option on the menu which is rare for Miami! Keep it up!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/8/2017,$$,4,Kush,If you are in Miami this spot is a must ! The dishes are unique and there are plenty of vegan options that taste amazing. I split the burger with egg on a waffle and a vegan chicken parm. Missing a star because the side order of vegetables was very disappointing - only a few pieces of peppers.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/5/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Love everything about Kush, especially how the attentive and genuine wait staff happily suggest ways to make most of their entrees vegan or vegetarian friendly. Every time I've been, I've walked away blissful and full."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/9/2018,$$,5,Kush,Great vegan options!! I had their three vegan taco special and my husband had the vegan jambalaya. Both were fabulous.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/2/2018,$$,5,Kush,Kush has to be one of my favorite spots in Miami  An amazing variety of beer options and the alligator tale app is to die for... if you dont order the alligator bites at Kush you haven't been to Kush! The Chicken and waffles are phenomenal! Let me tell you something about the Frito Pie.... ORDER IT! You won't regret it! If you're that person that's trying to get into the that vegan life.... Kush has great options for you too!!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Whenever I want regular fries and sweet potato fries at the same time, this is the first spot I think of. Best veggie burgers in town and paired with fiddy fiddy fries, you can't go anywhere else for a great burger after that. The vegan jambalaya is my other favorite dish when I'm not in the mood for a burger. Great vegan options, great drinks & great vibe."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Perhaps I wont be able to do this place justice so very important disclaimer: *vegan palate*,So, I have come to this hole in the wall twice now and have gotten the same thing: the vegan cajun dish wish soy chorizo and rice. It sounds and reads amazing but the taste is unbearable! Too spicy! Very hard to eat and finish a dish when your mouth is on fire! If youre going to have a vegan dish perhaps make it edible by most. I know many people like a hard kick to their bite but damn not all people and not that hard. ,I still have hope for Kush and hope they start dishing out more vegan options, thanks for having one in the first place!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/30/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Cute place. Every detail is thought out and tied together perfectly. If you go during the day you can avoid more of the nighttime busyness. Outdoor seating, doggie menu for the fur babies, great service. In the heart of art in wynwood. Check it out, vegan jambalaya is delicious!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/13/2018,$$,5,Kush,"This was definitely the trendiest hole in the wall I have ever been to. Located in a really cool part of town in the art district (Wynwood), this is a spot I will come back to. The place was small, but could hold a good amount of people during a semi busy happy hour. We went for an early dinner, so there was plenty of room for 6 people at a table. I went with a healthy-ish vegetarian option - the vegan jambalaya. After a week of eating everything in sight, I was trying to be good. The dish was good, but I do wish I hadn't tried to be so good. Everyone's burgers looked so amazing. We will be sure to come back and visit the next time we are in town, maybe even check out the other spots by Lokal."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Great food, great service,  fantastic folks. Very knowledgeable about beer selection. Everything on the menu is great including vegan options...psst don't forget to ask about off the menu items;) intimate setting, unique seating arrangement. Next door is the Botanica - room with craft beer for anytime or while you wait. Kush has one of the best CRAFT beer selections around ask my boy Caros at the bar, his recommendations are always on point. ,Chicken and waffles are a must, hobo frito pie and chicken skins are usually first for me. ,Highly recommended local TRUE miami spot."
"3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",1/3/2016,$$,5,Versailles Restaurant,Vegan Cubans: How wonderful el plato de viandas y vegetales! Yum - thanks for having it :)
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/29/2016,$$$,4,KYU,"From the subtle side salad to the colorful drinks, this place knows FLAVOR. As a vegan, I was able to choose a few items from the menu. It is extremely pricey and the portions are not that big, but the atmosphere is amazing and super trendy. The waiter knew his stuff and was very helpful."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"The ribs will turn a vegan into a carnivore.  Umami to the max.  Crunchy and perfectly cooked, no disgusting gristle bits... divine.  Even typing this review, one day after the meal, I'm salivating. I'm from Manhattan, and I am a bit of a food snob...so you can trust me.  This place is beyond.   You know those crappy wooden popsicle stick chopsticks that make you cringe with horror as they brush against your teeth with every bite?  Not here! The chopsticks match the atmosphere: streamlined, modern, and well designed.  Well worth the price $$$.  The cauliflower is crunchy and has a delicious creamy but light sauce underneath it.  The tomatoes with olive oil have the perfect flavor of the olive oil.  You can taste the quality and the creativity.  Hop on a scooter, or into a fiat, or onto a graffitied car, and get over to KYU as fast as possible."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/30/2017,$$$,5,KYU,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Wynwood! As a vegan, they have tons of veggie options here. There's something for everyone here. I especially love their roasted cauliflower and kale. Mmmmm! I recently organized my cousin's bday dinner there with a large group and the staff was always on top of things."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/25/2018,$$$,5,KYU,Love this place! Make sure to call early to get a reservation but the food is awesomeness. Good vegan options as well for your non meat eaters.
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2012,$$,5,Blue Collar,"Just love this little spot.   Situated in a super seedy motel, this quaint little restaurant has a truck stop/diner feel.    The menu is really vegetarian friendly, and I had heard about all of the fantastic side dishes, so I went vegan for the day.   I had the brussel sprouts, artichokes, beets and the sweet potatoes.   Everything was perfect.   I was so full, and I didn't finish my sweet potatoes.   The chef noticed, and asked if everything was okay -- it was better than okay.  As people walked in, the waitress and the chef recognized everyone -- lots of repeat guests."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/27/2013,$$,5,Blue Collar,Came here while visiting Miami. Heard great things about this place and had to see for myself. Lots of vegan options. Great beer selection. I tried the veal special and LOVED IT!!! Will def return during my next Miami visit.
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/25/2014,$$,5,Blue Collar,"The best comfort food in town, no doubts about it... Also many vegan options for those in low carb diet. My favorite sautéed kale, just delicious..."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/22/2015,$$,5,Blue Collar,"Small and intimate. This is a hipster's place to go. Greeted by Matthew, my server in a tux t-shirt I received the same quality of service I would in an upscale restaurant, if not better. Food? Truly outstanding. In the mood for veggies? Their veggie menu will inspire you to go vegan. The chef Derek Camejo came over to make sure my meal was good and introduce himself. The camaraderie of the small staff was easygoing and authentic. The decor was simple,clean with a touch of artsy vintage. I'd be happy to visit again."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/17/2016,$$,4,Blue Collar,"Vegans, vegetarians, and conovors a like. This is for you!!! Veggies are to die for and there meats are succulent. Fresh and creative. ,Something you would want to come early to though. The line outside is long. So you know this place is good."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/2/2017,$$,3,Blue Collar,"First time here for my girlfriends birthday. I'm vegan and was a bit worried I was not going to be able to enjoy anything. Luckily, they did have a few vegan options in their veggie section, not too many but atleast some. The food was tasty and filling and a pretty good price for the size of the dishes. The service was not all that great. The server could answer all my questions but the bussing was lacking. They really did not bother actually picking up the plates, as we all had to pass our own plates to the busser, and also did not even bother to wipe out table a bit, pour our water or wine. Maybe I was expecting too much but I think if I was really hungry and around the area I would come back."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/23/2017,$$,5,Blue Collar,"I love Blue Collar! I am in no way a vegan or a vegetarian, but all I ever get here is the veggie platter.,This time I got the roasted beets, the collard greens with bacon, the mashed yukon golds, and the sautéed mushrooms. I tried to save half of the plate to bring home, but I ate it all! ,I have brought many friends who all enjoy eating here."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2015,$$,3,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"They should add a few vegan options. They do have some vegetarian though. However, they were very accommodating and ""veganized"" their dishes."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/3/2016,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,Simply amazing and right next to Wynwood Walls. This is a must see place! I'm a vegan and they had a lot of options. My favorite was the flash fried bok choy! My husband is a meat eater and said the 48 hour pork belly was the best pork he's ever eaten
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"Regardless of what cuisine you're into - meat lovers to vegans - this place has it all. I've never had a dish that isn't excellent. It's too good! Excellent service, conveniently located next to the Walls."
"1035 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33136",6/12/2018,$$,5,Fooq’s,Beautiful rustic French restaurant. A small shop that can allows everyone to be a little bit more intimate. Service was great the waitress really knew her stuff. Food came out in a timely manner. Wine list has depth to it (I mean it's a French restaurant) I ordered a vegan entree I believe it's called seasonal vegetable tahdig and my girlfriend ordered the Fooq's burger very flavorful. Overall great wait to end the night.
"1155 Brickell Bay Dr, Miami, FL 33131",10/29/2017,$$,5,Crazy About You,"It was my first time at Crazy About You, & we were celebrating our anniversary. I looked at the menu options, & advised our server, Luis, that I was vegan. Although there weren't many vegan options, Luis advised the chef to personally make a special dish for me. He came out with a delicious quinoa salad (not the one on the menu). Luis was very courteous and very attentive to my needs (I'm also allergic to avocadoes), I will definitely visit CAY more often for brunch! Thank you Luis! (-:"
