Yea !!so yummy! local beer and international la Estrella beer amazing , vegan ice cream option just perfect ! they even let my puppy sit w us outside . 100 points for them."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/21/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"I never really cared for pizza until I found Paulie Gee's octopus pizza. It is seriously INSANE. I know it sounds weird but only until you try it, absolutely deliciiious. And btw, their vegan pizza are also really good, try the vegan ricotta and vegan sausage!!"
"7744 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",2/16/2016,$$,4,Grill Argentino,"Rincon Argentino is a nice, and cozy place, please if you are a vegan or veggie I will recommend not to come near this place. I arrive with a couple of my aunt, cousin, and sister. The friendly staff of the location immediately welcomed us.,We share some empanadas and sauce for our appetizer. This is of the few times that I do not repeat the sauces, I don't know what they add to it, but the taste and texture were incredibly delicious. Las empanadas were good too, it saw like in Miami almost every restaurant know how to make homemade and traditional empanadas.,For my main plate, I order La Picaña (The Picanha) is a cut of beef that is very popular in Brazil. In the U.S. it is little known, but referred to as the rump cover, rump cap or culottes. North American butchers generally divide it into other cuts like the rump, the round, and the loin. ,I order this cut of the beef because I was told by my sister that is the best cut she has taste and she describes how delicious can be.  This cut is big enough to feed two people, it comes with two-piece of beef cut, the picanha was delicious! The meat was very tender, the flavor was wonderful, juicy, everything about the cut was perfect everything like my sister told me, I truly recommend it, more if you looking to share a plate with someone."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/29/2016,$$,5,Aoki Teppanyaki,"I love this place. They have happy hour all day every day except evenings on the weekend. The music they play is great.  Their brussel sprouts, eggplant miso, chicken salad, kimchee pork, sweet corn, triggerfish jerky, firecracker shrimp and aoki slider are all amazing.  They have cool things like chicken hearts and beef tongue too which I am into.  Definitely try the chicken liver!!!! The sushi is fresh, I like their salmon and ikura donburi.  The soft shell crab roll is good. Many items on the menu ate vegetarian and vegan friendly which is awesome.  Honestly I have never even tried their teppan because the individual dishes are so good. The service is also excellent. Everyone is very attentive, dishes are brought out quickly and the management is caring.  This is my go to happy hour spot."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",4/1/2016,$$,3,Aoki Teppanyaki,"The Teppanyaki part of Aoki is awesome 5 star super delicious super reasonable and the chefs are friendly and entertaining.  I've experienced the Teppanyaki twice for lunch and it has not disappointed. They make the BEST mixed rice I've ever had in my life (no kidding). However, I decided to try their Sushi Happy Hour as they advertise some really good deals $5-$7 plates and drinks.  I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi was good, decent but not mind blowing.  Service can sometimes be slow and not streamlined though friendly enough.  Great vegan option is the laughing Buddha roll, no sacrifice in flavor and it's very light. I'm also a big fan of the kama kama (whitefish and salmon  cheeks)."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",9/13/2016,$$,5,Aoki Teppanyaki,"I love to be able to go places that offer a vegan option and aoki does just that! The farmers selection is so delicious and filling! All types of veggies! Aoki is one of my favorite restaurants, its amazing and i recommend it to everyone! There lunch deals are the best"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/28/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Love love love this place! It just opened and we have already returned three times. My boyfriend has recently turned vegan due to health restrictions but it's been a blessing in disguise. We have discovered holes in the wall places and experimented with off the beaten path dishes. We LOVE this place in particular for their vegan pies. The crust with the perfect char is what dreams are made of and the cashew ricotta dollops give me life! Inventive combinations of ingredients were meticulously arranged so substitutions are discouraged, I get that having lived six years in Italy the Italians too are very methodical in regards to the flavor arrangement leaving little to no room for changes. Don't take it personally, it's a science! Just walked out the door and already planning my return trip. ,I don't get way people are bashing this place on Yelp and my mind is blown by the comparison to Steve's Pizza and Spris... I have no bad reviews to pass onto either of those places but they aren't even in the same pizza league as Paulie Gee's. ,Try it! Forget all you know about junk-fast food pizzas... this place is purely for the artisanal pizza lovers!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/17/2016,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,5/5! I absolutely love the fact that Paulie Gees has a whole vegan menu and not only accommodates meat eaters. I tried the Vegan Greenpointer and it was okay but In Ricotta Da Vegan was amazing!! The faux fennel sausage was hearty and the arugula and cashew Ricotta went extremely well with the combo. Definitely recommend this place and will be back. Service was great and the pizza was out within 5 minutes of ordering it!
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/14/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing pizza with a great aesthetic. Seriously good pizzas and craft beer in an old Chinese restaurant that has been gutted but preserved. Lots of really cool Street art adorns the walls. They offer great vegan options as well, off street parking and good vibes."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/19/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The moon and stars were aligned tonight my friends. The mood, vintage china palace sign, and my appetite could only agree. The twinkle in her eyes gave me confidence we were in the right establishment. It was truly a magicaL experience. From vegan fennel sausage with cashew ricotta dipping sauce to a nicely portioned red, white, and greenpeaCe piZZa, Paulie Gee's came through in the clutch to say the least. My man Jason even gave us a run down of their trademarked triple proofed process of dough making. Can you say 95% gluten free crust? That's a true dough master if you ask me. Jason I will lend you my magical red boujee robe for some magical boujee vegan sausage. ,A simple candle light ambience was all that was needed to put the official stamp on a one of a kind dining experience. Hash tag magic happens here..."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/8/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"This is probably some of the best pizza in Miami, and hands down THE BEST vegan pizza in Miami. So happy to have found Paulie Gee's! Not to mention the awesome staff."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"The do a good pizza here at Paulie Gee's.  It's not Steve's or Dominos, so if you are in the market for those this isn't your place, but if you want high quality ingredients done in interesting combos you don't see everywhere this is your place.  Add to that a very warm, unique environment and a friendly staff from the owner on down, and Paulie Gee's is a can't miss in Mimo.  You have to check out the octopus pizza, the BBQ Brisket pie and the vegan tomato sauce.  Check it out!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/12/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"So far so good, due to my ball and chain I've only had the Vegan pies but they've been fantastic every time. I'll eventually try the regular pies but I have to say the dough at this place is some of the best I've had. I def recommend giving this place a try"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2017,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,The vegan pizza was really good. I asked for a little bit of arugula the whole d@*m pie was full with arugula. When I picked off the greenery I had enough for a salad. The vegan cheese was great and the sausage was fantastic. Next time I need to try the dessert
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",1/7/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Amazing Pizza, Service and alAtmosphere. The Chef talked to us since it wasn't that busy and he was so polite just wanted to know how we liked everything. We had the Vegan Pizza that came with HOUSE MADE  vegan sausage and ricotta cheese once again AMAZING! Will be coming back FOR SURE!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",11/3/2017,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie Gee's is one of my top 3 favorite places for pizza. Me and my wife drive all the way from Ft. Lauderdale just to have their pizza. They make excellent Neapolitan style pizza with a vegan twist (they serve both vegan and non-vegan pies). Their house made vegan sausage and cashew ricotta cheese is amazing! Also, the place itself has a really cool vibe and great for a couple's night out. My only ""complaint"" is that they do not accept American Express."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/6/2018,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've driven by this place a bunch of times, but stopped in for the first time tonight. My partner can't eat dairy, and we were told that they have a good vegan pizza, so we thought we'd finally give it a try. Her pizza was delicious! I got the spinach pizza with garlic and it was awesome! The crust was perfectly crispy and chewy, fresh from the wood burning oven. The veggies were super fresh. The ricotta I added was creamy and tangy and a wonderful addition. Service was SUPERB - which is so refreshing to experience in Miami. We'll definitely be back!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/24/2018,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"We've ordered a couple times from Paulie Gee's. Mostly because it's a close and quick delivery when we're hungry. We've tried a vegan (In ricotta da  vegan) and a regular pizza (Green Pointer) and both were ok. Not your regular cheese slice and they have a creative twist on ingredients.  I like the chewy crust but need to try other options , next time one with more sauce.  The two I've gotten have had a lot of arugula. Too much that you can't really taste any of the other ingredients or flavors. Find it a bit pricey for these gourmet pizzas. It's not the New York Pizza I was expecting but I get what they're doing.    Also, ordered the eggplant parm which contributes to the 3 stars. Super disappointed. There must of been only 2 or 3 slices of eggplant and such a small portion for $22. I shouldn't of assumed that $22 meant an entree , the portion was more like an appetizer. I should of know better than to order eggplant parm from a pizza place.  Ironside pizza is close by and I personally think a better option."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/31/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A hidden jem in Wynwood, Miami. After being really disappointed in another restaurant (Kiji Cuzco) in Wynwood my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Love Life Cafe. From the moment I entered even after being starving and cranky from the last place I was in complete bliss the aura alone made me happier. The cafe offers a great vegan selection and Miguel (the cook and waitress) was such a cheerful person  to speak to. It was my boyfriends birthday and I really wanted to treat him to a nice meal. Being that we're both vegan it's difficult to find a place that we could eat anything on the menu and this place for filled this, as well as make filling food anyone would enjoy. I ordered the Plant Powered Arepas (they are to die for) and my boyfriend ordered the Best Burger (I have never tasted a better burger). There's Holistic health and Yoga I wish I was here longer to take advantage of! Overall great environment and vibes."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,best vegan spot in wynwood! the burger is honestly better than a lot of regular burgers i've had. new favorite!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/19/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,I really love this place even though it is pricey! The arepas are my absolute favorite and I love the desserts that they offer! My husband (who is not a vegan or vegetarian) said the burger is one of the best burgers he's ever had!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/20/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,AMAZING vegan food. My favorite by far is the award winning vegan burger.. definitely recommend even to my non-vegan friends!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I would of never found this place if not have trying yoga here! But they have the most delicious vegan food, the menu is well thought out, the ingredients are super top notch, its a super homey feel, the salads are amazing, and the burger is literally the best! Its also pretty convenient and quick considering its made to order right in front of you! LOVE everyone and Love Life Wellness they feed your belly and your soul ;)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Tastiest vegan pizza and burger, and the salads are ummmazzinng!!!! Everything is soo good and fresh, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/12/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"One of the BEST vegan places I have ever visited! Delicious bowls, great service and chill, yogi ambience! Definitely recommend it and will come back during my stay in MIA, I love love life!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"As vegan meals go, these people got it right. Fresh made on the spot. Wholesome ingredients and well balanced flavors. Really good. ,  Warning: from the outside you see yoga sign and the symbol that's it, had to double check, but when I went inside the place clearly was a studio for gathering with the kitchen being more an added bonus, but WOW, great bonus."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/30/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Don't walk - RUN - to Love Life Cafe. Tried it out today with a friend who is more vegetarian/vegan for lunch today and was super impressed! The lentil curry soup is TO DIE for and I literally want them to sell it by the gallon so I can eat it every day. I also had the Love Life salad which was HUGE and so filling. I could have just ordered a side salad with the soup or just the big salad and been fine. Service was amazing and it is a whole wellness center. Looking forward to trying more of the great food and trying the other non-cafe services that they offer. Will be back!!!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"A little hard to find but trust me, well worth the find ! The food was amazing and delicious ! Highly recommended this place for a great vegan lunch !"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/7/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,I ordered  my lunch on UberEATS from love life cafe. I had the burrito which came with a small salad and I also purchased a cookie for dessert. Everything was delicious! I could only finish half of the burrito and left the other for left overs for later. I will definitely be going to the cafe to check out the ambiance and try more of their delicious vegan food!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/14/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Happy to be the first review for this hidden spot in wynwood. Although I am not a vegan, I try to focus in low processed - plant based foods. The arepas and the tacos were very good. And the Kale salad was awesome. Friendly staff and cool looking center."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/14/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Loving the love life cafe a hidden gem in the tail end of wynwood customers and employees are just sweet/ kind all around. You have to try the love life burger, delicious from the first bite to the last paired with the sunshine spice smoothie was a meal in vegan heaven. I'm definitely coming back."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/7/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Super super super good plant based drippins. If your vegan and want food that you can taste the love then this is the place for you. Best Vegan Burger around by far. 100% vegan menu so you dont have to worry . Place has such an awsome energy and vibe dont take my word come find out your missing out.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This food was amazing. A great variety of vegan food and I was in heaven haha. My husband had the Veggie Burger and he said it was extremely good. It was gone very quickly. It came with sweet potato fries with cilantro garlic aioli that was VERY good. I ordered the Walnut Lentil Tacos and was extremely impressed. We each ordered smoothies that also tasted fresh and delicious. No complaints at all. ,You order at the checkout line and they bring the order out to your table. Very relaxed and casual environment."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/29/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"I love the food here! I usually get delivery since its near my office. The Love Life Salad is great! I also love the Taco Salad. Both are incredible salad option. Curry lentil soup is pretty good, although on some days its better than others. This doesn't bother me though because that means they make it fresh everyday! The zucchini noodles and meatless meatballs are also my favorite. The sweet potatoes fries are really good too. They taste baked, so not too oily. Can't say anything negative, the food is amazing and I feel great eating so many veggies. I'm not actually vegan, I just enjoy vegan food!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/24/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Amazing food. Good vibe. Try the Crema (cashew cream) with whatever you order. It's delicious. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but this place has become a favorite.
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2016,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great vegan restaurant with a little shop!,Well organized space with a high ceiling.,The waiters are really friendly and ready to give advices and little extra herbs or anything.,Ingredients are fresh and prepared in front of you. There's also a good range of choices for a vegan place!,Good pop music.,Only downside is the location a bit out-centered and near the highway but you don't feel it inside."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This veggie burger is seriously delicious. It's actually become a problem that I live only a mile away and become a regular. In adventurous moods, I've also tried the incredible pizza (best vegan pizza I've ever had) and pulled jackfruit sandwich, which was similarly delectable. I won't lie that the prices are a little steep, but the ingredients and care with which everything is prepared makes it worth the price. The staff are all friendly and the space is interesting. Ultimately, do yourself a favor and go because you won't be disappointed by the burger (if you're vegan or otherwise)."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/20/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"REALLY like this place, not quite 5 stars, but still really yum. I am happy to finally see the vegan food scene starting to gain some sustainable traction in Miami - it has taken a LONG TIME.,That said, not all vegan food is health food per se. So, you still have to be conscious of what you are eating.,Overall, I think Love Life provides a solid balance of healthy vegan food with indulgent vegan food. The prices are a little high, but not extreme. (Except for the bottled drinks - those markups are pretty extreme),So far we've tried the veggie burger (*really good* Best in America? ), Walnut meat tacos (tasty, very filling, but pretty bland), the arepas (also great, super filling, but missing spice) and The cuban burritto (ditto).,The sides really stand out as the most well seasoned and delicious - the kale salad and the sweet potato fries are winners.,My biggest desire for the food here - is for it to have more flavor. To play more with seasoning, textures and sauces. (Vegan ""aioli"" is as over-played (and unhealthy) as the real thing.),I have not tried any of the desserts yet. But they are on the list!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/17/2017,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"This place quickly caught my eye as more than just a vegan cafe but a wellness center. They offer spiritual talks and yoga classes which I appreciate very much. I think its very commendable for a food place to get involved in the community going above and beyond by showcasing what they preach. ,The place is on the corner of 27th and 6th. Its a huge 2 story place with couches and large tables to host large groups. They also have a large studio for their yoga classes and not sure whats upstairs. ,I came around 9 am on a Monday morning for a few hours and the first thing I tried was their bodytek smoothie which is a green smoothie with  vanilla vega protein. It was good but didnt leave a lasting impression. I would have gotten a cold press juice if I went back. ,For food I ordered El Burrito and their award winning vegan burger. El Burrito was great! Fresh lettuce and beans with a nice cream sauce- got it for a nonvegan and he loved it! ,The burger comes with sweet potatoes and a salad. I must say the burger was THE BEST vegan burger i have ever had! The vegan cheese wasnt too smokey and the burger was exceptional. It was delicious! Highly recommend! Loved it ,The reason I give it a star less is because of the service. The 2 people behind the counter making the food were great, freindly, and very helpful but I couldnt help but notice there were so many people who seemed to  work there. There was about 5 or 6 people going behind the counter grabing cups and puting things away all without acknowledging me. Very very laid back environment. Mind you I was the only customer buying food there and I was there for 2 hours...,In fact while the young lady was making my food a women by the name of Veronica kept interruping her to ask her questions about stock and if she put the kale away etc..All food prep talk that should be taken care of when there is NOT any customers around and esp when the customers food is being prepared, please let her focus on the magic she is making. ,Meanwhile, there was an artist walkkng around placing his artwork and another young guy rearranging the flowers as if they just opened this week. Then I ask and they have been open for a year! I think decorating and food prep should be done behind closed doors or before the place opens. And awknowledge your customers!,I think this place is really on to something with their concept of full body all around wellness and off the wall food. I just think with a little more organization and better customer service it'd be just right."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow, we found our new favorite Vegan Cafe. That didn't take long at all. Either did our wait for perfect clean food. Wow. ,Curry Lentil soup, a super clean veggie soup. Carrots and celery added perfectly. A veggie burger on a pretzel bun with massaged kale, incredible. Moist and so well balanced. The hummus and dressings are perfect and the baked spicy sweet potato fries (not fried) JUST WOW WOW WOW! ,Pictures will be added next time we go!!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"By far my favourite vegan cafe in Miami. I'm celiac and now vegan as a result of health issues. I've ordered from here twice in the last two days on Uber eats and have received BEYOND what I asked for. All meals are exactly as ordered with accommodations made, and the staff is SO kind. I cannot wait to stop by in person and pay them a visit. Everything is local, organic, and made in house (a rare find for food that arrives so quickly). This to me, seems more like a movement than just a cafe which I truly have a lot of respect for. Keep it up, and keep loving life"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Best vegan place in the wynwood area! Fun, creative spot where they do yoga/wellness classes. Lots of gluten free options as well. I'm not vegan, but thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Big portions!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/21/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My first time coming & it won't be my last. I'm always in search of a great vegan/vegetarian spot, and this one made it to the list. I had the avocado toast with the kale salad on the side. I was speechless, the flavors came together perfectly. I will recommend this spot to my friends : ) ,(A plus: you can take yoga classes in the second floor)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/15/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Good was amazing! Had the vegan burger with gluten free bread - super yum! My husband had the Cuban wrap and he loved. Can't wait to go back!
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Great spot in Wynwood! They have really tasty Vegan options and you wouldn't even know how healthy this food really is, cause it tastes so good. Don't expect super fast service if they are busy, but its worth any wait time!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Paulie gees delivers excellent, creative, flavorful pizzas in a scenic, art filled establishment. The staff is friendly and the variety is out of this world. I appreciate their vegan pizzas and desert options. I saw the dominoes across the street and couldn't help but laugh at how much more authentic this pizza is. How'd they manage to fit so much creativity into one business?! Do yourself a favor and try this!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/16/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Vegan Nutella pizza... NUFF said. ,This place keeps it real, NY style pizzas right on Biscayne blvd baby. Love the passion and character that PG's gives off, from the funky art all over to the beautiful leopard charred pizza crust. ,The owner also has a strong background in NY style pizza and when you mix that skill with catering to vegans; well... what you get is pure art. Homemade cashew ricotta, homemade vegan fennel sausage, Vegan Nutella pizza? Come on who even thinks of these things? Nucking futs.,Oh, and it's BOGO pizza every Wednesday + karaoke. ,Yes, You're welcome."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/24/2017,$$,3,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Tried one of the vegan pizzas. ,Pros: ricotta is delicious, dough is excellent and perfectly cooked. Sauce is fresh and yummy. ,Cons: entirely too much arugula. Enough to make a side salad. ,I paid $3.00 to add mushrooms to my pizza and got a couple of stems. Total rip off. ,Also ""sausage"" was very sparse. Pretty yummy so I wish there was more."
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2018,$$,5,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Awesome service. Such a cool and funky spot, bring friends who are into that. Vegan here-- awesome vegan pizza and the cheese is actually good and unique! Vegan nutella pizza!!! Have yet to see that elsewhere, give it a try. Non-vegan approved too!"
"8001 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",12/22/2016,$$,4,Paulie Gee’s Miami,"Hey! What do you know? Vegan pizza?,A friend of mine told me about Paulie Gee. I searched in my database and I remembered the NY pizza guy that is pretty famous in NY, actually had won some of the best pizza awards over there. ""Yes, that's the guy"", my friend told me. And with that introduction, I move on to my review.,The space is brand new, and it sits few people (as of the date on the review). One community table for about a dozen, and three tables for about another dozen. If you don't mind eating at the bar, I am sure you don't, then add another dozen more. At the bar, they serve local beers from MIA, Wakefield, Funky, etc, so that is a big plus for the pizza/beer combo.,The pizza is pretty good, but it is hard to rate. The toppings and the combinations are really good, and the dough is burnt and chewy. The pizza sauce is delicious, the cheeses are really good quality, but the dough may feel pedestrian and average. It has a very subtle flavor that is really hard to catch. I would compare it to naan bread, but it tastes like pizza. The good thing about it is that you can fold it easily (it actually folds itself!), and you can chew on that stuff forever, on and on and on.,The salads are excellent, and they have many vegetarian choices. Also, they have a whole list of vegan pizza which I found very enticing.,The people here are very friendly, very humble. The kitchen is just an open oven, with locals working around diligently. I really liked the atmosphere.,Big plus: One retro pinball machine in the back. Drop a dollar."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/24/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"My latest favorite vegan restaurant. As a foodie I think it's important that even healthy vegan foods should taste great. Not ""good for being vegan or healthy"" and unfortunately sometimes healthy and/or vegan food lacks flavor. This is NOT the case for Love life.,I've been coming here since I tried their best veggie burger at a veggie burger battle last year.,They continue to experiment and improve their menu. ,Located in Wynwood this is a shared space with a yoga studio(studio is located upstairs). It's a casual boho vibe with one large communal table and a few small tables. My current favorite is the chamo bowl which is listed under their specials menu (temporary menu) near the register. It's a latín inspired bowl filled with brown rice, black beans, shredded seasoned jackfruit that looks exactly like pulled meat, plantains, avocado and some delicious sauces drizzled on top. I'm salivating as I write this btw. I hope they never remove this from their menu because it is delicious. In addition they have veggie burgers, salads, bowls, pizzas, soups, acai bowls, smoothies and desserts. There is something for everyone. Keep sharing the  love, love life we see you! ,P.s they teamed up with happy vegan bakers and are now offering some of their pastelitos . Does life get any better than this?"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/7/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This is hands down the best vegan restaurant I've been to in Miami. The service was on point. Everyone was super nice. The food was out of this world. The tacos were the perfect combination of spices. The gluten free Mac and cheese was moist, cheesy and delicious. Kale salad was perfect. Sweet potato fries were fantastic with this amazing sauce that I couldn't get enough of. You will not be disappointed. This is my new vegan spot. Oh AND dog friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"This review is based solely off my experience with Love Life Cafe via Uber-eats because I have YET to visit the actual location, but they've easily become my go-to vegan spot when I want to order takeout. I've had a few items from their menu and they were all great: the best veggie burger in america (delicious flavor for a plant based burger), the pizza Diabola (first vegan pizza i tried and i'm hooked) and the Pizza Verde (also very delicious and healthy). I need to stop by in person soon :)"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2018,$$,3,Love Life Cafe,"I was really excited about this place and I'm not going to say it's not a good spot, but I will say it is pricey and there might be better options out there.  I had the best vegan burger in America and while I felt the title was optimistic I had other feelings about it.  I've been to several vegan restaurants so I feel I have the right to compare.  I'm very happy to see this type of restaurant in the Wynwood area and I'm happy to see that it's a community type place.  I would love to see freshly brewed ice tea or other drinks here and not just everything in a bottle.  Good menu and certainly a place to start for someone trying to make the switch or trying something new.   Closing it out at a 3.5 rating."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/22/2018,$$,4,Love Life Cafe,"Following a doctor's appointment at Boscom Eye Clinic (eye surgery), my husband and I desired some good 'ole vegan food. I conducted a Yelp search and found Love Life Café, so we jumped in the car and headed about 3 miles away. As we drove I became a little nervous by the neighborhood, but didn't say anything as my husband couldn't really see after his doctor's visit. Had he been able to see he would have said, ""keep on driving"". I am one that is up for interesting places to eat, so I thought it would be fun to eat in a place located in an industrial park that was probably once a garage to fix cars. ,I was pleased with the décor. It is an open space with couches, chairs and tables. They do all sorts of classes during the week, so would be an interesting place to go outside of the food. That being said, on to the food....,I placed our order at the counter and sat down. I ordered a ""cheeseburger"" and my husband a regular Best in the World or something like that, burger. it was delivered rather quickly and was absolutely delicious. My ""cheeseburger"" was better than my husband's ""best in the universe"" burger. I wasn't overly happy with the fries as they were limp, apparently they needed a good dose of Viagra.,I would have loved to give them a 5 star even with the ED fries; however, the customer service was lacking. When we walked in the young man at the front desk didn't say one word to us. As I mentioned earlier my husband had an eye appointment and was unable to see so I had to read the menu to him. I then had to guide him to the table so I told the cashier to give me a minute and I would come back and order. He looked as though he could have cared less...and didn't say one word. No ""what can I get you"", no ""no worries"". Nothing. It wasn't just the lack of verbal communication it was his presence. He acted as if he could have cared less that we were there...and in fact there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant so I would hope they would want their staff to be extra friendly. ,We had an opportunity to go back the next day since we had a follow-up appointment but decided to give another restaurant a try and experienced better customer service."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/4/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Ooooooommmmmmmggggggggg. Came here with my girlfriend because she's vegan and I'm not. OMG amazingggg. I will start eating here regularly. Take outs etc .... you need to come to this place ...
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/10/2017,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Wow! Hands down the Best veggie burger Ive ever had. I'm always looking for new vegan/vegetarian places and this is definitely in my top favorites. ,Really awesome spot, small menu and the food is just really good - flavorful, and best of all healthy...the veggie burger, wraps and salads are all great. The vegan carrot cake is outstanding.,My least favorite thing are the arepas. They were really bland tasting, texture was just layers of mush. I added hot sauce for more flavor. All in all love the food, staff is super friendly will be back!"
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/21/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,"Just passing through Miami and was looking for a vegan restaurant. Thanks to Yelp we found this gem!  Food was fresh and delicious. Staff was very friendly. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable. I had the pizza verde and my daughter had the sunshine spice smoothie both were awesome!  If you are in the Wynwood area, check them out. PS-they are also pet friendly."
"2616 NW 5th Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,Love Life Cafe,Love life cafe is the best began cafe in Miami! The menu items are unique and priced reasonable considering they are organic  & have a gluten free option. Super tasty and always fresh. Don't expect your food to be out in 5-10 minutes if you're in a rush. They take their time to prepare a delicious meal but trust me you won't regret the wait!! The desserts are to die for especially the vegan carrot cake YUMMM!!!

Try any of the shakes delicious and filing. as some of the food is not very filling since its all vegan. the lentils were very good also. was able to shop for some organic products while i was there. great shop, great service."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/20/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Best healthy food option in the neighborhood and usually packed at lunchtime as they offer homemade vegan dishes and have inside seating available.  A little pricey as i usually spend between $10-15 for lunch and a drink, but well worth it.  They also have everything under the sun to whole food multi-vitamins, raw chocolate, organic juices, books on healthy lifestyles, and even a talented musician comes in and plays on certains days for the lunch crowd.  They're also very informative and helpful with any questions you may have."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/18/2014,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"I had the vegan chicken empanada, good with their hot sauce.  I also had their pasta.  It tasted fresh, great marinara sauce, but it was microwaved.  That machine should not be in a health food store.  Overall good experience.  I'll be back.  $10"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/6/2011,$$,5,The Honey Tree,With not too many vegetarian places around The Honey Tree is a gem. Go for lunch or even just to grab a few healthy snacks. They have vegan cookies and other baked goods that Taste great. Great tasting lunches and a selection of healthy drinks. Live healthy.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2009,$$,4,The Honey Tree,Lunch: around noon (12:30-3:30) but they also save leftover if you run too early or late. Food tasts realy fresh and amazing. Great cakes (some are vegan) and a nice place to buy food and more healthy product.

The empanadas and pizzas are too die for. Can't wait to try more things on the menu  literally eating the new vegan empanada as you read this. I'm drooling hahaha
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/28/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,So many delicious vegan options! Even my non-vegans ate them instead. Staff is very informative and nice! A must when I'm in South Florida. My friend ended leaving with a half dozen frozen empanadas.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,I love this place. I've only been twice. But each time the food is so so good. The vegan chorizo pizza and the vegan empanadas are beyond. The owner is so cute and the spot itself feels warm & cozy. A must try and repeat!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,My son and I ate vegan today. We had berry guacamole and pizza. My son is helping me embrace this vegan lifestyle. He hasn't said no trying anything yet and he actually asked to come back to this restaraunt. Great job
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/21/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Yaaas yaaas yaaas! I don't know why I waited so long to come here!! Lots of vegetarian and vegan options! Empanadas are delish!

"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Wow. What an amazing place. I loved everything from the decor, to the vibe. But let me tell you about the food. We took the owner's recommendations and had their signature empanadas that are made in a wood burning oven. To die for!! We had a delicious coconut butternutsquash soup. We also had blackened grilled fish tacos that were bomb. They have an amazing vegan & vegetarian selection. The owner Fufi is super passionate about everything in her restaurant and it showed. This is definitely our new spot in Miami. 5 star!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/5/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"*vegans/vegetarians/folks with food sensitivities double check your food* ,Y'all. I was soooo excited to try this restaurant. Argentine-style empanadas? Yay! Vegan options? Omg! They completely had me before I stepped foot in the restaurant. I even made the drive down all the way from Ft Lauderdale. ,When I first arrived, the bartender/server was quite kind and very attentive. I placed my order for 2 vegan empanadas, a glass of their Argentine rosé and their soup of the day (potato leek). ,I was promptly served my rosé and it was delish. I couldn't wait to try my food! ,This is where things took a turn for the worst. Folks started to trickle in after me but their food came out before mine. I'm thinking, no biggie. Maybe the vegan empanadas take longer to bake? ,30 minutes go by and I haven't even gotten my soup. I'm a super patient person but at this point I'm a bit concerned. 45 minutes have now gone by and not even a mention of where my food is. My server has not acknowledged how long it's taken and everyone around me is enjoying their soups, appetizers, deserts and empanadas. What happened to my kind, attentive server?,At this point, I'm just hungry :( ,Finally my food comes out all at once. I'm almost finished with my wine. I would have normally ordered another glass but I'm a bit over it at this point. ,I try the soup and it could use a bit more flavor but it'll do. I try one of my empanadas, the vegan chorizo and it was okay. Again, it was missing a bit of something but it will do. ,I then bite into my second empanada and I don't even recognize what I'm eating. ""Oh, this is cheese"" I think to myself. ,*sigh* I'm super sensitive to dairy. ,I call my server over who is confused as to how this could happen. She assures me that she put in the right order (I completely believe her) and that there was a mixup with the kitchen. ,She kindly did not charge me for my empanada and gave me a discount on the wine. ,There seems to be other diners who have had this problem so I think this is something that Fufi should look into just a bit more. ,This place has the potential to be phenomenal but I just can't give it more than 3 stars after such a long wait for food I couldn't even eat. ,+1 for the private parking behind the restaurant."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/29/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Ordered two vegan pizzas for my birthday, they sounded really good and looked even better when they arrived. Only problem is that BOTH pies weren't cut, at all. We literally had to use my plastic cake knife and a butter knife to cut the pies. Wish they tasted better for all the hard work we put into cutting them!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Where do I start?! This place is amazing. I've been coming here for two years and I have only seen great growth. The hospitality and atmosphere is just warm and inviting. Florencia's empanadas are delicious and huge in variety, i am vegan and she has so many vegan options. You can't go wrong with anything it's all so delicious and nourishing. They even have a vegan apple empanada coconut milk ice cream dessert. I mean you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have a great happy hour 4-7 pm two empanadas and a drink. Mexican pizza is delicious. Just try it for yourself you'll love it!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/3/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Nicely welcomed our party of 8 without a reservation. Fufi was amazingly nice and explain the menu and history of the business. I got the lunch special of salad, soup, and chicken and beef empanadas. I loved the salad dressing and the lentil soup, but the empanadas were amazing! They have vegan, vegetarian, and meat options. The dough was crispy and the filling tasted great. Highly recommend!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"We came right as they opened on a Monday, so the place was very clean and the one employee that was working the front of house was extremely polite. We ordered one of each of the vegan empanadas, along with the vegan Mexican pizza. It took almost an hour to receive our food, there were also people waiting pretty long at the bar to pick up to-go orders. The mexican pizza was delicious, my only ""complaint"" would be the vegan cheese they use doesn't melt so it was falling off and quite messy to eat. The garden and beef garden empanadas were the best, so flavorful and piping hot. The curry empanada wasn't bad, just a bit bland. We used a bit of their hot sauce on everything though, which were so spicy and tasty, but even they didn't redeem the curry flavor. Our chorizo empanada came out last, yet it was a bit cold inside. The flavor was also blah, like a can of tomatoey beans inside dough, but my boyfriend actually liked it. But the crust itself on all the empanadas was spot on, perfectly crispy and delicious. They are also small, but not too pricey. I wish we got to try the apple pie dessert, but we were scared it would add another half hour to our stay. Overall, it was a cute small restaurant with lots of vegan options and great service, we will go again on our next trip to Miami."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/5/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I took my son's aunt there for her birthday - specifically for their vegan options. We were welcomed warmly by the owner and she really went above and beyond making my sister in law feel special on her birthday. Created  a special vegan birthday creation empanada just for her. ,We ordered the steak, bacon/Brie/date, and curried eggplant empanadas and they were all fantastic. We also got the Gaia vegan pizza which was just as delicious and berry guacamole. Chicken tacos were ordered for my son - and although he gobbled them up, I honestly would have just ordered the chicken empanadas instead since it's the same filling.,It was a great experience with options for both vegans and meat eaters to enjoy, and the owner was a joy to chat with."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/27/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Gotta hand it to Fufi. In this culinary wasteland called Miami, they're really trying to do their best for us vegans.,The empanadas here really hit the spot. Just don't catch them on a sloppy day or they'll be cold on the inside. Hit or miss I'd say. The waitresses also tend to confuse what's vegan and what isn't.,I've tried some other stuff on the menu and just like most other vegan options in Miami, it's a sad substitute that ""gets the job done"" for most people. But it's still expensive and bland.,Good enough."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I stopped by Fufi because I heard they had vegan options on their menu. That's an understatement - they have so many options for every craving and I was shocked at how many off menu items they had when I mentioned I was vegan. The service here may actually be the best experience I've had in Miami and the owners are so welcoming you'll feel like family.  List of absolute must try items:,Mushroom empanadas - mixture of three different types of mushrooms with garlic and onions (vegan),Vegan beef empanadas - vegan beef crumbles, peppers and onions with a special chipotle sauce on the side,Gaia vegan pizza - vegan mozzarella, roasted eggplant, onions, peppers, arugula and balsamic drizzle,Vegan apple empanadas with a side of vegan vanilla ice cream - don't be alarmed if a tear falls from your eye when you taste it"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/15/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I'm not vegan, but visiting Fufi with a couple of friends and loved it. Great food  and the service was awesome too. Will go back again."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"FUFI is a hip, fresh and affordable restaurant. Their happy hour (Monday- Friday from 4pm-7pm) is the most amazing deal I have yet to receive in Miami. You receive two homemade baked (not fried!) empanadas and one drink of your choice for 7$ total. I ordered a special eggplant curry empanada and a spinach mozzarella empanada. Both were delicious. The sangria I ordered was not to my liking, but it was a very generous drink portion, and came with an edible flower! I also split the vegan pizza and substituted mozzarella for the vegan cheese. My friend who shared it with me is huge meat eater, and even he loved it. The service at Fufi was great, and we received our food with a reasonable wait time. The restaurant isn't close to my neighborhood, but I definitely plan to be back, likely for happy hour"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/4/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Love their empanadas and this small little neighborhood joint in Buena vista. Fufi is always here and very welcoming. My favorite is the ""beef"" garden. How can something vegan be so good! To die for!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,Yummy Vegan food in Wynwood area.  It's a small place but there is outside seating.  Service and price is great.   I would highly recommend and will be returning.
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,The restaurant is very hippy like and very casual. I think it's a little to pricey for the type of food. I didn't like my vegan pizza meanly because it was way to greasy for my liking and it didn't have a lot of flavor. I wouldn't go back there. The service was nice
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Oh my oh my oh my the Vegan options abound at this amazing eatery! Let's start with the  delicious Malbec pairing with the berry guacamole which is so unique and delightful!! Guac with pomegranate and dried cranberries...sooo much more amazing than you would think!! We ordered ALL of the vegan empanadas and the faves were the Chorizo and the Beef Garden but my god all were fabulous!! ,Service is amazing. She is letting us just chill through this crazy thunderstorm. P.s. parking is in back off 46th Street!!! Come and try you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Vegan empanadas are great, just be sure to double check that they give you the vegan version!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/9/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"I was looking for a healthyish dish after one of my occasional gym jaunts, and was drawn to Fufi - I'm going to sound like our orange hued leader - but by a cute girl who was noshing outside as I drove by. I did chat with her, found she was not an employee and even (gasp) vegan. But you guys should definitely hire her for marketing =),As noted, they have outside seating and I learned they are dog friendly, so Princess Luna will make a visit sometime.,But anyway, back to my dinner. Fufi's has a menu with broad appeal to both vegans and omnivores. Trying to balance both worlds, I ordered their taco salad (with added chicken of course). You know I like my food seasoned and customized, and I wasn't disadppointed. For one, they took out the avocado (not allergic, just OCD against it). The cilantro dressing was rich and tasty without being overwhelming,  and there was plenty of cheese and tomatoes.,Me being me, despite the gym, ordered their apple pie (though I customized out the ice cream). This deliciousness has a thin crust, plenty of apples and nuts- see, fruits - and a light cinnamon taste. It's definitely a good close to my meal."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/1/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Fufi's is great for everyone. They have meat options as well as plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. If you decide to eat here I suggest the empanadas. That's what they are known for and they are excellent! (I ordered the pizza once, it wasn't bad but like I said stick to the empanadas). ,Fufi's is a small and adorable cafe located in Buena vista right next to Lemoni cafe. The owner is Argentinean and prides herself in making great empanadas. All of the vegan empanadas are delicious and she will test different flavors adding new ones to the menu which always keeps things infesting. My favorite is the garden meat (she uses the ground meat from Atlas) and the chorizo and bean. Other flavors include, eggplant curry, creamy corn, mushroom and goat cheese and many more. ,In addition to empanadas, she also serves tacos, pizza and apps. Their soup of the day is always vegetarian friendly and each time more delicious than the last. ,I recommend ordering a cup of the daily soup, a few empanadas and an Argentinean wine. Then sit back and enjoy yourself. ,P.s I took one star off only because almost every time my empanada order gets mixed up. Although they do fix my order, it's happened several times.,But I come back anyway !,Tips:,Yelp check in offer- one free empanada ,happy hour special. 2 empanadas and a drink for 7$. ,Outdoor seating available,Dog friendly"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/6/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"This is a great little hidden spot! The service was friendly and they made my friend and I feel really welcome. The decor was very quaint with a lot of beautiful plant life around the restaurant. It isn't very big but it is very comfortable and feels a bit more intimate that way. It is a bit pricey but quite worth it for the quality ingredients. The restaurant is also vegan and gluten free friendly, with clear markings on the menu listings.  ,Their empanadas are definitely what first attracted me to try them but other selections, such as tacos and pizza, are also great choices. ,The caramelized onion, mushroom and goat cheese empanada was listed as a ""people's favorite"", and I can see why! The flavors blended together perfectly. The eggplant curry empanada was also very rich in spices and flavor. We also enjoyed the berry guacamole; it was a combination I had never thought to try but the flavor contrast worked so so well together! A great start to our meal already. ,For my entrée I had the fungi pizza, containing mozzarella, truffle oil and several types of mushroom. It felt very sophisticated compared to your typical pie. It was not too oily and the mushrooms were cooked so they were flavorful and soft. Every option for pizza was very unique and I love the different spin they put on this area of their dishes. It turns an option that can easily be one dimensional and boring into something exciting with depth. ,For dessert I had the homemade tiramisu. It was creamy and delicious, while still not being too heavy. Cutting into it with the spoon was so easy and oh so satisfying. We were also pleasantly surprised with a sparkler and candle for our little birthday celebration! ,It was all very sweet and I definitely hope to return soon!! Quality ingredients and a great environment. Fufi easily earns 5 stars from me."

"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/25/2009,$$,4,Joey’s,"Located in the middle of semi-gritty yet artsy design district, Joey's is a small 'upscale' yet laid-back Italian restaurant...perfect for a business lunch or simply a lunch date. Waiters in red are attentive and take initiative, we had breadcrumbs on our table and one of the bus boy wiped it clean so we could resume hand-fondling tabletop!  The bossman came by to make sure we are taken care of when the lunch crowd trickled in. Food was thoughtfully prepared. Soup of the day was mushroom soup (vegan, no cream used but still creamy. Pureed consistency), served with olive oil drizzled in a smiley face. I recommend eating it with the bread; feel free to ask for more if you run out! Papardelle with crabmeat and mushroom was creamy yet subtle. Trofie (little corkscrew pasta) with meat sauce - WIN! Portions were huge for lunch, there was leftovers for dinner!,Soup - $5,Entrees- $15 each,I would come back here if I am in the area...enjoy! ,Tip-bits:,Street parking available right outside Joey's,Lunch menu available with decent portions,Accommodations for big groups gladly made"
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/1/2015,$$,3,Joey’s,"Food was good! Dined with 4 teenagers, 1 vegan, & 1 pescetarian! There was something for everyone!  Only caveat:  Service was lacking.  Was seated immediately, which was a plus, but waiter took his time to serve us water, didn't say hello, not very pleasant(young guy).  Waitress that took the order, nice/friendly, but overwhelmed by the crowd(NYE during the day).  She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. Had to wave down someone to get us more water. Had to ask for the bill, then waited forever for her to bring it, then pick it up!  It's a small venue, the place was packed quickly, but it was surprisingly & refreshingly quiet.  We could actually hear ourselves in conversation!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/20/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Every time I am in this area, I always try to stop here for lunch.  It opens around Noon and they serve lunch until they run out, which is by 2pm.  They have a variety of healthy soups, salads, and main courses that are prepared by the owner and his family, on site, daily.  You go to the counter and tell them what you want and the amount you want.  I suggest you try a variety of dishes.  Then they weight your plate and that is what you pay.  It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for - a great, home cooked, healthy lunch.  There are several tables inside for dining.  It can get pretty busy around lunchtime.  I wish they had outdoor seating as well.  They also sell a variety of bottled drinks, healthy organic grocery items, organic lotions, and aromatherapy items.  It is much more personalized than Whole Foods and with a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to eat clean, vegetarian, or vegan."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Healthy, homemade vegan cuisine at its best. I love that they have different options, almost in a cafeteria-style line, available on weekdays. If only they could start offering dinner, I would certainly come back here more often! ,The store itself is very small, better to take the food to go, and offers only a minimal amount of grocery items. ,Great place for a quick office lunch to go."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",4/28/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,Totally recommend this vegan haven. Or anyone that cares about ingredients or just good food. Friendly staff and the owner is more than likely always there. Not enough seating during busy lunch time hours and not enough parking. But well worth the wait!
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",1/17/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Truly one of the best health food stores / vegan restaurants in the city.,The staff is incredible from Sirhan to Michelle and the food is fresh, delicious and healthy.,Definitely a gem of a place & a great lunch spot"

"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2012,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Call me stupid,  but I had no idea this place was a Vegan/Vegetarian health market. ,""STUPID!"",I was looking for a detox after consuming a week's worth of Quaker cereal. ,Unfortunately for me, I forgot I was living in Miami, where lots of folks take care of themselves, thus juicing/detoxes were to no avail. ,What kind of loser buys detoxes?,*raises hand*,Things continued to get gradually worse as I made the fatal mistake of asking if they sold Meat and/or Dairy products. The store clerk emerged in vitriol --- a blank stare --- I thought I was going to be hanged on 'The Honey Tree' (wherever it's hidden).,There's a counter towards the back where they make juices and homemade-vegan food, plus a small area where you can sit, chat, and have bite of some of their delicacies.,I had a portion of their lasagna --- wait that has dairy, what?,Okay, it wasn't lasagna.,What tasted like lasagna was actually just zucchini, tomato sauce, and roasted peppers.  ,These Vegans really do well in duping the uninformed."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"My rating is based just on the food and juice bar, as the other items I find expensive.  For the lunch bar, the food is fairly priced, fresh and delicious.  Most places in Miami that offer healthy vegan and vegetarian food are not so gourmet and usually cost your whole weeks income.  Loving the Honey Tree right now for a day when I want to go get some good wholesome food and stay under $8 usually.  They change the menu daily so there is always a new dish to try, and huge selection of juices and smoothies to keep you from getting bored."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",3/19/2018,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Best Vegan food in Miami.  Owner holding strong to Local products and being in business for 23 plus years.,Support Local and be the change we want to see in Miami!!!,they just got a new Alkaline Water disperser that is so promising and very affordable!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Lunch buffet is reasonably priced and there is alot to choose from. The food is in the back of the store and upfront they sell vegan products like soap, shampoo etc. I didn't buy anything from the store but I'd go back based off the food."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2017,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a hidden gem, especially for vegetarians and vegans, although everyone will enjoy the food here. The Honey Tree is a small natural food store with a cafe in the back offering daily made vegetarian and vegan specialties. ,I went on a Wednesday, which luckily is lasagna day at the Honey Tree. They had two types of lasagnas - regular with vegetarian ""beef,"" and gluten free with vegan cheese. Both were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. They also have tons of other food options daily, as well as a smoothie bar. ,My favorite part is that they have a different vegan cake every day, and they're all delicious. Sometimes I go just to pick up a slice!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Delicious vegan fresh food sold by the pound! I was there for lunch and had experienced their daily buffet! :) I had a dish full of food including veggie rice, asparagus, kale, potatoes with spinach, veggie quesadilla, shaved Brussels sprouts, and avocado salad ($13.32).  Also, i added a veggie spring roll ($3.50) for lunch. For dessert, I took a fruit salad with almond cluster to go which was delicious ($6.99). The fruita included papaya, mango, starfruit, kiwi, and pineapple. I ate so much and was definitely satisfied! Will most definitely come back! Also! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Finally, parking is freeeee which is a nice perk!"

They have a limited amount, lunch only so If your interested don't come late afternoon or you'll be disappointed.  I feel like I'm really feeding my body well when I'm here. Yummy too."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",2/4/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Food is exquisitely fresh, vegan, and delicious.  They bring in prepared salads, quiches, and soups at around 11:30 AM, and they serve until it runs out.  You stand at the counter and point to which you would like to try, and they scoop it onto a plate and weigh it.  They often sell out of items like the tofu-spinach quiche because folks place phone orders to reserve a slice (sooo good!  Don't slam tofu quiche until you try it!).,I had roasted butternut squash, roasted broccolini, marinated portobello slices, a competent tomato/avocado salsa, and a cucumber-mint salad with chick peas.  My friend let me taste the quiche and I ended up eating half of it.  We finished the meal by splitting a fresh vegan, gluten-free strawberry cake, and it was soft, sweet, and pretty.,They also make juices and smoothies and have lots of vegan baked goodies that look scrumptious.  Did not shop the market, but it looks pretty well stocked.,The genuine, tie-dyed hippie staff are extremely nice and quirky.  Stay away if you're wearing Lululemon and a sneer.  The price for lunch was certainly more expensive than a burger and fries- but this is  real honest cooking served with warmth.  You'll leave feeling nourished, body and soul."

At first I never knew about the warm food that's for lunch on a daily basis. All vegan and vegetarian. Service is so nice and friendly. Honey tree is all in one. Its a health/organic mini market. Love love love this place.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/18/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a great place to stop in for supplements or speciality vegan food items (e.g nutritional yeast) if you don't have time to go all the way to Whole Foods.  I was impressed by the variety of vitamins and supplements for a small store.  I also picked up some nutritional yeast, chia seeds, an vegan gravy packets while I was there.  I can't wait to go back and try the smoothies and food at the cafe."

I enjoy their witty signs they have on the wall and out front. The ingredients are fresh and the menu is all organic healthy stuff, which I love especially the morning after a night out. I always get smoothie #2 with vegan protein added and the avocado toast. Recommend to anyone who likes good tasting food thats also good for you."
"1429 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/30/2018,$$,5,Jasmine Sushi & Thai Cuisine,"By far my favorite discovery as an FIU student. A gem tucked next to Publix, Jasmine's has easily made my list of top restaurants to return to. I have had birthday and graduation gatherings here because nothing feels more celebratory to me than their tofu massaman curry. I have yet to try tofu as flavorful as theirs, making them a great vegan / vegetarian friendly option. Their lunch prices are very cheap with great portion sizes. It's a great trip to feel fully satisfied at a low cost.,The owner, Richard, is also friendly and approachable. He acknowledges his regulars and makes conversation to make them feel at home. His team is very fast and friendly, and they already know by now that I'm ordering their delicious curry whenever I visit. Their veggie rolls are delicious as well, and my family has enjoyed every time we have come."

I've been looking for a good indian spot here in westchester and while it seems to focus on Spanish food, this is some of the best Indian food I've had! The chicken tika masala and aloo ghobi were amazing. Also a good place to take a vegan friend!"
"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/16/2016,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,What can I say...this place is amazing !! For someone who is trying to eat healthy this place hits the spot. Their bean burger wrap is fire and their smoothies are so refreshing and great. They also have a white bean soup only served on the week days that is truly great. I have gone several times in one week and it's always great. Highly recommend this little gem in the gables ! P.S this is a great spot for vegans although I am not vegan.
"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/31/2018,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,Love the almond butter açaí bowls I always get them here also their vegan brownies and other treats are yummy I order my food online and when I go to pick it up it's ready fast.

"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/8/2016,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"Loved this cute little spot! Perfect for a light healthy lunch. Tried their vegan soup of the day & it was one of the best soups I've had. So much flavor & very fresh. ,That is kind of the theme here. Everything was fresh & healthy but did NOT lack any flavor. The avocado toast with coconut shavings was amazinggggg as well. I also gave their smoothies a try & ordered the ""kale crazy"". ,Can't wait to come back to try an acai bowl & a cold pressed juice!"
"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/25/2018,$$,5,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"I love to go to this place after I teach my yoga class.I get the açaí bowl and they make it to my liking. I was so sad when the Gables Farmer's Market ended because I couldn't get the açaí bowl anymore, but now that I found this place, I'm so happy! It is rather costly , but it's worth it. I also loved their vegan cookies they have packaged at the counter. So yummy! It's usually busy in the mornings on the weekends and you'll have to wait for your order, but it's worth the wait if you are not pressed on time."
"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/19/2018,$$,4,GreenLife Organic Bistro,"Great spot for a healthy meal. The açaí bowls are in my opinion, the best in Miami. Try the Gogi Bowl! They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options."
"104 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/7/2018,$$,4,GreenLife Organic Bistro,A great place to enjoy a nice bowl of açaí outside! They also sell lots of vegan friendly dishes! Follow Miami Mangia for more reviews!
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/10/2018,$,4,Spice N Curry,"Spice N Curry is an Indian Grocery Store that also serves cooked Indian food from its small cafe in the back.. but from the looks of it, you wouldn't know that they serve food. The cooked food is the reason I've been coming here for the last few years. It's located in one of my favorite strip malls that also includes Vegan & Juice and Chinese Guy.,The food here is very tasty and authentic and the portions are generous. They have a small menu which includes items such as samosas, naan, and some other items that I have been offered as samples. The server here is friendly and always willing to conversate. My favorite entree is their Goat Biryani which is large enough for 2 meals.,The other day I discovered some fresh squeezed Indian bitter-melon juice in a green bottle in their fridge for only $5.99.. another reason to come here. The best way to describe this is nature's medicine and it's said to fight cancer, treat diabetes, regulate blood sugar, and treat a host of other common and/or serious conditions. All I know is that it's super healthy, but most people won't like the taste.. it tastes fine to me. You just take a shot of it each day (and don't overdo it because too much of anything can be bad for you) and the bottle lasts for about a week."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/6/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"I am a huge Indian food fan and Spice and Curry is awesome! They have a small cafeteria in the back of a grocery store and about 12 people can fit on their counters and wait to be fed deliciousness. Their meal combos range from $7 to $9, and i normally get their vegan option. I leave w leftovers all the time. Do yourself a favor and visit this hidden gem!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/28/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"A plus plus all around!! I'm recently vegan and this place offered such a good variety of flavor - all in one dish! I ordered the vegan curry and was surprised at how much food I was given (I couldn't even finish, so I took some home). The meal includes rice and a salsa on the rice, two lentils, naan, and another hard bread (sorry I'm not too familiar with the food names) and a drink, all for $8! This is definitely another hidden gem in Miami. Side note - the home made vegan turmeric cookies are amazing too!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",11/10/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,I'm so glad my boyfriend took me to this restaurant. I had the vegan curry and for $8 I had one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had in my life. It comes with plenty of food and different flavors. The naan bread from here is so delicious as well!
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/7/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"Great food! I had the Chicken Curry meal that was very filling. My girlfriend had the vegan cauliflower and potato curry.

"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/23/2018,$$,5,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,"Obsessed with this place! It's like Chipotle in the sense of being able to build your own bowl, only Mediterranean. The food is so flavorful, nourishing and satisfying. Lots of plant-based and vegans options, too! Happy to have a healthy go-to that doesn't break the bank."
"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/17/2017,$$,5,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,"I typically go to the Rice House in Brickell where I live and it's definitely one of my favorite places, being Greek and all. Today the new location in Coral Gables opened and they are introducing a new concept that really puts them on the map. Instead of the traditional platters you get at other locations, they have created a ""Chipotle-food line"" concept. The food is much cleaner catering to regular carnivores, like myself, or if you're vegetarian or vegan. And can I say the decor and restaurant itself is gorgeous!,You start with picking: grain (white or brown rice or black lentils), salad (3 lettuce choices) or a half and half. Then you have 5 different spreads/hummuses you can chose from. Now comes my favorite part: the protein! Slow cooked chicken, lamb, beef, meatballs, veggies or falafels. The toppings are unlimited so load up. Last but not least, the sauce. I'm a sucker for their sumac dressing which I swear has crack in it because it's that good. Voilá a masterpiece is made. ,I'll be sad once everyone finds out they're open since the food is good."
"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/21/2018,$$,3,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,First time here came with my daughter who's vegan she told me what to order loved it kind of pricey for lunch but well worth it .
"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/1/2018,$$,4,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,"It's good alternative food, very good quality produce, good portions and wide variety of ingredients for your dish. I would have liked to be advised before paying my bill that I have to pay extra for half an avocado  (usd 1.75) which was lying in between all other ingredients to choose from - no mention of extra charge on the menu board!!!! Although I really liked the food I was very disappointed that none of the employees knew which salad sauce is plantbased or vegan - they did not even seem to know what these words mean. That's poor training for a supposedly healthy restaurant!"
"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/27/2017,$$,4,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,"I loved the food. Very fresh and tasty with lots of options, also pretty good for vegans/vegetarians as well. Parking was a nightmare though. I would love to visit again but I hesitate everytime I think about the parking nightmare and accessibility. I think I met the owner or manager and he was friendly & helpful."
"164 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/20/2018,$$,5,Rice Mediterranean Kitchen,"Loved my entire experience at Rice. I'm vegan and they had awesome options for me. I ended up getting a bowl 1/2 lettuce 1/2 black lentils with hummus and some other spread. I got falafel on top which were SO GREAT. Crispy outside and soft inside. I don't live in Miami but whenever I visit, I'll be sure to stop by.,In a really cute area of coral gables .. walkable to the Hyatt Regency. ,AND.. vegan coconut cashew cookies. Mmmmmm"

"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",6/29/2017,$$,5,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"My first time going to Cooper's Hawk was an enjoyable one! I went for dinner last night 6.28.17 with a group of girlfriends and loved it so much, I've been raving about it to everyone since! I can't wait to return for happy hour! The restaurant is located in CityPlace, a new upscale entertainment shopping mall-like area in Doral. Our reservation was for 7:30pm, but we had a difficult time locating parking near the reataurant, so i recommend to go straight to the parking garage. I was there for 2hrs and parking was $4.00. The wait staff greeted us w a huge smile and immediately took us to our table. Sweet décor, with fancy and comfortable booths all over. Rachel, our server was exceptional, you can tell she has food service experience and is very well informed on both the food and wine menus..not to mention friendly, attentive and courteous. She immediately explained the concept of the restaurant and informed us of the complimentary wine samples for up to 3 different wines per person. She initially brought the Winemaker's Barrel Reserve to try...very generous pour and so delicious..it was a Bordeaux, then the Hawk Red end finally the Cabernet Sauvignon..We recieved a warm pretzel bread w a side of honey mustard..so yummy and soft..we had 2 of those. The menu is extensive and they cater to vegan/vegetarians, so i was pretty happy..i ordered for my entree, the Veggie Burger..oh sooo soo good! I veggie paddy is made from red quinoa, black beans and rolled oats..just wow and its huge too!! It comes w a side of fennel quinoa salad..one gal had the brussel sprouts appetizer, which were charred perfectly and had a delicious sesame sriracha aioli sauce on top and the portion was large. We were all satisfied w our foods! No complaints, just total raves! For desserts, we had a chocolate covered strawberries! Perfecr! Everyone was delighted with their food and overall experience. Will definitely be returning soon!"
"12590 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",1/19/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"Pincho Factory, no matter the location, always delivers! Each and every food item is a must-have. They are most popularly known for their Toston burger, but I love the Toston chicken sandwich with queso frito added the most. You can't go wrong with anything though. They are also vegan and vegetarian friendly with their veggie burgers or the rice bowls they have in a myriad of flavors (packed with plenty of veggies). I love the chimichurri bowl with chicken! Packed with bold flavor and the chicken is cooked just right. ,This location is one of the most recent that opened and they are consistent in terms of food quality and service. I love it here and highly recommend coming by for a burger or one of their rice bowls. ,You can also choose to buy sides separately. The tater tots are a huge hit (with good reason) and I suggest trying it with their cilantro aioli sauce vs the Apple butter it comes with. You won't regret it!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/27/2018,$$,5,Doraku Sushi,I love Doraku!! I come here a lot and it's always delicious. The brussel sprouts and crispy bok choy are my favorite along with the veggie fried rice. Vegan friendly. Excellent happy hour specials. The service can sometimes be slow but they recently got a new manager named Edmundo who seems to be improving the service a lot. I highly recommend this place!

Lots of vegan options and the menu also offers a macro count on each item - so very helpful if you're keto. I got the lemongrass chicken in a collard green wrap and it was one of the best wraps I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/28/2017,$$,5,DIRT,Yum! I'm so happy this opened up in Mary brickell! I have came here every day for the past week and I can't get enough. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade and healthy! I live for the vegan wrap (love the mint) and their tomato soup! I'm super sensitive to sodium but their soup has just the right amount. Portions are huge and the quality is just right for the prices. If you want to only spend $5 go to McDonald's!! Run in and grab a coffee or tea from their coffee bar or walk up and order a healthy organic meal! You won't be disappointed.
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",12/12/2017,$$,3,DIRT,"Love the ambience, healthy food varieties, but wish there were organic options (especially for their eggs). The collard wrap (mai fun vegan wrap) I got was not worth recommending, only part I enjoyed was the sauce. The rest was bland and raw. Don't waste your $5 getting the Adashah as an add on... was advertised as ""amazing"" but honestly more bland than plain polenta. I'll be back to try other things.."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/12/2018,$$,4,DIRT,Decent place with lots of vegan options. Portions are very big. Tomato soup is very yummy :)

I am not normally a ""vegan"" person, so I let Ruth guide the way as I ordered a few bowls to bring home to the family. ,At our table of five, we all agreed that the food was DELICIOUS. Each and every item--Korean Fried ""Chicken"", Chipotle Cashew, Creamy Combinasian--has its own distinct, bold flavor. ,I am adding this spot to my list of favorites."

We are living in modern times, my friends!!!,The place it's cozy and easy to find... No doubt, Wynwood is where most interesting things are happening right now.,Portions are huge and prices are super reasonable. They offered mostly bowls and Big Rolls. And ladies and gentlemen, the big rolls are on steroids: Enormous.  It's like a full meal rolled into pure goodness.,I tried the Tasty Teriyaki Big Roll for $9 . I chose jackfruit as my meatless protein, and  it comes with lettuce, red onions, carrots and green peppers mixed on a teriyaki sauce. It was delicious. But now that I'm thinking about it, the only missing items were wasabe, ginger and soy sauce to complete the 'sushi' experience. ,I'll definitely be back... This is exactly the type of food I'm craving after a night of drinks in Wynwood. ,Happy hour, anyone??"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/16/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"CombinAsian is where it's at! I tried this restaurant for the first time last week. Being a NON-vegan I was a little skeptical about whether or not vegan food would taste good and be as filling as my typical meaty meals. I first tried the Cilantro Lime Bowl. It was packed with fresh veggies and sautéed tofu and topped with a refreshing cilantro lime sauce. I was impressed with the balance of ingredients, the overall flavor, and the fact that I didn't miss eating meat with my meal! I enjoyed my meal so much so that I decided to go back later that week. This time I tried the Kim Bap Pow Roll, which was also fresh, delicious, and filling. I ate it with a side of fried kimchi that added just the right amount of spice to my meal. The awesome food is accompanied by friendly owners and a relaxed atmosphere to eat."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,This was my first time at Wynwood and I knew there were a few vegan spots I wanted to try and I happened to come across this place by accident and was so happy I did. My sister and I got the creamy CombinAsian bowl which filled us up so quick. It was really really satisfying and yummy. They also had Chloe cupcakes which were so amazing I fell in love. This place had pretty loud edm type music when I was there which was cool and they had different types of board games on the tables which was great so you're not on your phones.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/23/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Best vegan option I've had in the area so far. excellent KFC chicken. Cool spot. Get you crispy on. Filling and satisfying.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/7/2018,$$,4,CombinAsian,"my family and I stop by this place about eight days after it opened. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. The food that was available was excellent. Finding nice vegan macaroni and cheese is difficult but my kids asked for seconds at this place. ,We ordered three different bowls, all of which were fantastic. ,Being a new restaurant, there were a few things that are still being settled i.e. running out of rice. But overall the food is very tasty and we would definitely come back again if in Miami in the future.. The restaurant has a great concept and I hope more people come out to Wynwood to try it."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,Let me start off with I'm not vegan or vegetarian just so you have a clearer understanding that literally anyone can stop by and enjoy a heavy or light meal. First time here and me not ever trying tofu I was blown away with the scramble I had rice beans scramble and some Korean noodles wow the options are amazing and the owners welcomed me in with open arms. The dumplings are FIRE as in good crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I will be back and thanks again for breaking down what everything is made with and all the preparation it takes to make a good vegan dish. P.S. load up on the pineapple sauce you won't regret take my word for it.
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/25/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,I am so glad i found this place! This is the tastiest vegan food ever a must try for sure! I love the environment and the fact that they have wifi  i am def coming back
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/9/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Awesome little place, a little slow but they'll catch that rythm. Definitely worth checking out even if, like me, you aren't vegan."
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/5/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"Pleasantly surprised. I am not a vegan, but I enjoy fresh foods.  I went for the ""Super Bowl"" - a combination of many items. Delicious and fresh. The sauces we had were also amazing. Excited to try the rest of the menu!"
"2324 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2018,$$,5,CombinAsian,"My family and I checked out this place the other day and we're so glad we did! It's hard to find authentic Korean food in Miami and the potatoes, spicy pickled cucumbers and japchae (Korean noodles) were the closest to the real deal back home in DC! I love the Asian/Korean spin on vegan burritos and bowls. It's sometimes a hit or miss with vegan foods, but I'm trying to eat cleaner and this bowl right here didn't let me down! I'm definitely a sauce girl and tried all of them. All four were delicious but the teriyaki along with sesame dash complemented my bowl quite well. I got the tofu scramble, ginger broccoli and japchae in my bowl and shared the Korean braised potatoes and spicy pickled cucumbers with my sister and cousins. They ordered different burritos (kimbap and customized) and they were all delicious. The interior is really cute and I love the stadium style seats. I've only seen it a couple other times in DC and love the chill laid back yet hip vibe at this place. Did I mention there is also a DJ?! Only in Miami! So happy that Miami now has a spot for vegan/Asian/Korean food for when I visit my cousins and hope to see more Korean dishes in the future!"
"2320 Salzedo St, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/5/2017,$$$,5,Ruth’s Chris Steak House,"I've always had a good experience at Ruth's Chris. I come here with my family about once or twice a year, and the food has yet to disappoint. The chefs really know how to prepare the dishes, and the servers are very professional and polite. The menu has a pretty good variety of options, and the servers and chefs are also very accommodating if you ask for vegetarian or vegan options. There aren't many vegan or vegetarian options on the menu, but the server will accommodate any dietary needs and take ingredients out of certain dishes, if asked.  Again, the service is always fantastic. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Coral Gables. I love the location-right off Miracle Mile-and I can't wait to go back. After my meal, I usually like to visit Books & Books or the art cinema located on the same street, just a minute walk away! There's valet, street, and garage parking. Reservations are necessary."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",9/19/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"5 stars for their vegan toston burger!!! This is not the mediocre, frozen veggie patty I'm used to from non vegan burger joints. It's made from scratch and is SO perfect sandwiched between two tostons."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",4/22/2014,$$,3,Pincho Factory,"Came to Pincho Factory for lunch only to experience they were having maintenance issues and would be opening two hours after scheduled time. I was bummed about it and just headed over to Sarussi that is located on the same shopping strip. After lunch and on my way to the car, we notice Pincho Factory is indeed open so we head in at least for dessert. The minute we walked in, I smelled burger juice...like the grease. Maybe it's because my husband is vegan and I've been turned off of meat a little but no lie the smell did slightly gross me out. ,For dessert, there were two options- an Oreo Pie and a Nutella Smore's Pie and they are provided by Sweetness Bake Shop. By the sounds of it, the Nutella would have been my choice but I'm glad we got one of each because the Oreo ended up being the better of the two. Although it didn't blow me away, it was alright- It must have been tucked away in the coldest part of the fridge cause it was a little hard and mega cold on my teeth. ,Hoping I can come back to Pincho Factory soon to update my rating and actually judge them by their own food and not that of their bakeshop."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",3/30/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"This is a place that surprised me. A pincho is meat on a stick so I originally expected just that. Secondly I expected typical greasy, bland tasting fast food. The kind that requires mayo, mustard and ketchup for moisture and taste. But I was delighted to find great flavors and interesting meals. This is fast food taken to the next level. The flavorful level. It's as if someone opened a fast food restaurant but had training at French Cordon Blue. In fact, the only typical ""fast food"" about this place is the furniture. My daughter raves about the burgers especially the toston burger. Which is a feat in itself to make it tasty and to keep it's shape. She licks her fingers every time. There is also a vegan burger that I hear converts people. I am trying all the bowls one by one, having difficulty choosing one. They offer fresco, california, tex-mex, latin, chimichurri, Mediterranean style of bowls, salads and wraps with four choices of delicious proteins. But DO NOT expect anything typical. So far Im favoring the cali because of the mandarins, almonds, gorgonzola cheese and mango sauce.  Omggggg. And the portions are so generous. You will not leave hungry. You can also get hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. Apparently they have award winning fries, and yuppppp: pinchos!!! And a surprisingly great selection of beers and IPAs. I keep telling myself I'm going to get a pincho one day but then I walk in and see the menu and there's just too many great choices. I have a feeling though that they too are probably delicious. The only item I considered just ok were the sweet potato taters. But I am a huge sweet potato lover who believes it should be paired with salt not sweet. And you gotta give them some area to grow. Lol. Also Im always crazy full by the time I get to the taters. So yeah. That."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/2/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"They did it again!!!! The food is healthy amazing and has vegan options!  Everything is so yummy!  It's also great because everyone remembers your name and says hello!,My favorites are the dirty vegan salad and the poke Bowl with adashah instead of tuna for vegetarians (although their tuna is high quality and I love it!!!!) and you can't forget the coco chia pudding!!!! I can eat it all day plus if you bring the jar back you get a $1 off the next one!,Today Jeff (an owner who is at the register and greeting guests daily) even offered me to try a new sauce with the adashah (which is an amazing vegan thing to replace meat) it looks and tastes like a filling and yummy cornbread almost... ,I promise you it's the best vegan spot you will ever try and if you're not vegan the rest of the menu plus tuna and chicken are high quality organic with no hormones or anything. The flavors are amazing and it's all made fresh!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/25/2018,$$,4,DIRT,"It's nice having more healthy options in the area. This place is pretty great for the health conscious and is vegan friendly. ,Pros,Great design,Great options,Local food,Great location,Priced similarly for the area. ,Cons,I would skip the coffee bar if you want something high quality. I came for a latte because I saw they had a La Marzocco machine, which is wonderful if you know how to use it. Makes an incredible espresso. Unfortunately the barista didn't have the knowledge to use the machine to its best. I've lived in several coffee cities like Seattle and am use to getting incresibly amazing coffee. So keep in mind you may not care about that if you are usually happy with Starbucks. If you go to Panther or Eternity, you won't find the coffee very good. The bean isn't bad, but it's all for nothing if no one can use the machine well. ,Service-wise, I was a initially surprised that I wasn't offered a new drink, but I didn't mind paying for a new one. The general manager came by eventually and asked if he could remake the drink but it wasn't much better to be honest. Still very foamy milk for a latte that didn't properly blend into the espresso. He also gave me a free Zak the Baker cookie, which was nice and delicious. I would recommend the business invest in barista training with Panther. The coffee bar is a good idea and will be even more worth it if it's the best thing locals can get in the Brickell area."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/22/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Cranberry iced tea is refreshing and made fresh! Matcha pancakes were amazing and vegan :) they guys who work there are super nice!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/10/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"If we had one in Tampa, I'd eat here weekly! Flavorful, interesting vegan/vegetarian options with a nice outdoor area. I'm really liking this Adashah protein, which I've only seen here in Miami."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",10/25/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"Fast and friendly service. Servers are very attentive. Delicious options and I love that it is vegan and omni friendly. The best places are the ones we can all get something.,Update. The prices are great for the portions. The dirty vegan salad was way bigger than what I was expecting for the price. This is my go to spot now."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",7/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Let's talk about that Impossible Burger. In the wave of plant-based foods here in Miami, this is by far the most delicious and interesting thing I have experienced. Fairly new to the DIRT menu, it's 100% Vegan and mind-warpingly delicious. It's deliciousness, down to a science. At its center is a vegan patty with amazing texture and maybe even better-than-beef taste -- along with fresh spinach, sliced heirloom tomato, and a perfectly sliced and well placed onion (reminiscent of In-Out-Burger). While still experiencing that primal joy that comes with diving your face into a burger, post meal I walked away with a feel-good stomach, a smile, and maybe even a little bit of that chipotle sauce on my cheek. I left wanting another bite... Do yourself a favor, go get your hands all up on its tasty and puffy vegan buns."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",5/9/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"This is my kinda place!! The food here was so clean and delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly and the service was fast. I want to try everything off their menu. Lots of paleo, vegan, and vegetarian options to choose from. The interior is definitely ""Instagram worthy"" of you're in to that sort of thing."
"1558 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/9/2017,$$,5,POKÉBAR,"They have something for the strictest vegan and the meatiest carnivore, and everything in between! Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a good bite in South Miami!!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/29/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Dirt is one of my faves! Dog friendly local restaurant chain with creative healthy cuisine that has plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Also, DIRT offers different meat dishes for the meat lovers! What more could you ask for? ,I first went to DIRT at their original Miami Beach location, and since then I have seen the service and menu improve SIGNIFICANTLY. There are plenty of creative dishes that I haven't even had the chance to try yet, but everything I have ordered from DIRT I have enjoyed. DIRT also provides nutritional info for every dish on their menu (not just calories, but also fat and protein content) so you can make smarter dietary decisions based on your needs. They are very willing and open to accommodations, such as swapping meat or fish for Adashah (a vegan based protein). Adashah is a vegan, nutritious lentil based protein that is made by a local entrepreneur, and it is featured in many of DIRT's dishes. You can even by uncooked adashah from DIRT (sold in their display fridge) so that you can easily cook and customize it at home! I'm a huge fan of adashah, and DIRT is currently the only place I can get it in Brickell (for both cooked and uncooked versions)! ,What I've tried at DIRT Brickell (all were delicious and very filling!) ,Frittata tostada (I got the eggs poached and without sriracha- I can't handle the spice),Clean bowl (subbed turkey bacon for adashah to get a higher protein content, and made the dish vegetarian!),Dirty vegan salad (added adashah for protein) ,Summer poke bowl (sriracha dressing was spicy, so if spicy is hard for you like me, I'd take it off or try something else!) ,Summer adashah plate (surprisingly no customizations for this one!) ,I've also had the açaí bowl here, which wasn't bad, but I'm also picky about these, as I used to work at a smoothie shop that offered marvelous açaí bowls with yummy plenty of different flavors. ,There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at this brickell location. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching in Mary brickell village and has shade. I also really appreciate that DIRT always has complimentary lemon cucumber iced water that is tasty and refreshing! Also, because you order at a counter, you don't have to worry about paying tip at this restaurant!,Dirt has something for everyone, make sure to support your local business and give it a try!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was introduced to this place today, and I am so happy I was! The location itself is a bit hidden, but the food was delicious. When I saw the menu, I got super excited because I am always looking for new vegetarian/vegan friendly places that serve fresh, tasty food. ,The cashier recommended the quinoa bowl,,and it did not disappoint! Quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, avocado, tomatoes, broccoli, and more in what tasted like a basil pesto type sauce. Yummmm! ,I will definitely be back to try more!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/27/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love Roots. Great smoothies, vegan bowls and desserts!  Even if you are not vegan you will love this place!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/1/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Been coming here more because I've been training for work next door. They have great vegan options which makes it great for people who go plant based.,I have had their lentils and frijoles bowl for lunch and they were good but wasn't satisfying for my cravings. The food was very filling and nutritious. The portion was also good enough to share with 2 people. Smoothies are great too. They aren't loaded with sugar and have tons of antioxidants.,My favorite there would be the acai bowl. It has varieties of fruit other than strawberries and bananas. The granola is nice and crunchy and adds the perfect amount of sweetness. They also have almonds and toasted coconut flakes which give each bit a different taste. The serving size is pretty large and can be shared with 2 people. The price I would say is still pricey.,I am now giving them a 4 of 5 because of their philosophy. They are purely plant based and believe in high quality ingredients."

My husband and I tried the Wellness Smoothie, avocado toast and lentil bowl. As a traveling vegan, this was a rare find. Love the priority on healthy eating, which is unfortunately way too rare these days. Bravo to these awesome folks and their gamble that some people really do want healthy food, and it looks like it's paying off. Delicious!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/9/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Honestly, this was the most delicious smoothie bowl I've ever had. I had the dragon bowl and it is hands down gorgeous. It was delicious and all the fruit was perfectly ripe. It may be $8.50 but it was more than enough to share with my boyfriend. He enjoyed it too. It's nice to see a place like this, where a vegan can go and get something without it being a hassle in Miami. I can't wait to try more of their products. And the owner was sweet and adorable! I hope it does well!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is awesome. Juices are fresh and your body will thank you for drinking them. The food is delicious and extremely healthy - tastes like someone made it for you at home. I am not a vegan/vegetarian/health nut by any stretch of the imagination but I look forward to having a chance to stop in.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/14/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan but ran into this place and decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Dragon Bowl & Avocado Toast. The Dragon Bowl was amazing! Filling, refreshing & pretty lol! The avocado toast was good too, just too much avocado for me, but this seems like it should actually be a pro."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/28/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Even though I'm not a vegan, Roots is still one of my favorite lunch/breakfast go-to places in Miami. So if you're holding back on coming because you aren't vegan either, DONT! They're food is super great for everyone and their Fruit bowls and smoothies are the best thing to have on a hot Miami day. My best friend is vegan so it's nice to have a place near the area we can both go to enjoy. Wish they had more places down here like this one!"

Although I am not vegan, I'm in love with this place. I can only afford to spend 9 bucks on a juice smoothie once every other week, but I have always enjoyed those smoothies up until the last slurp. :)"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/25/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Great vegan spot! Wish they had one closer to Doral. Drove down to try it after hearing good reviews and was not disappointed. Simple and delicious vegan food and fruit smoothies!

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/21/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love love love this place! I am not vegan, but I would say this place is a vegans paradise! Every time I get a juice from Roots I instantly feel better, more energized, ready for my day. Their smoothies are sooo good! Crave is my favorite, it tastes like a cinnamon roll. I was never too much of a fan of pressed vegetables into a juice, but then I tried their juices and I never turned back(I've even thought about doing a juice cleanse, but I think I'll wait a while before doing that). Some people may think this place is expensive as all their juices/smoothies are $8 each, but you do get a lot of it. Also, if you're hungry I suggest you try the morning bagel! It honestly blew my mind when I remembered I wasn't eating actual cream cheese, it was full of flavor! Roots has a star reward program where if you get 10 stars you get a free drink! Totally recommend even if you're not into ""vegan"" places!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"love this place! great healthy option in the heart of kendall. this place reminds me of somewhere you'd typically find in coral gables or wynwood, so it's really refreshing to have healthier options closer to this part of town. i love the pb+j smoothie, and they have one of the best acai bowls i've tried. i love the atmosphere, even though it can get a little crowded while waiting for food during a rush. i'd rather pay $10 for a wholesome, vegan smoothie here vs $8 for a smoothie filled w sugar syrup somewhere else. it's priced about the same as any quality health food restaurant... not a ""cheap eats"" place, however quality ingredients cost more and you can tell the difference in the food and how you will feel after!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great staff, great service and most importantly great food! Really enjoy the acai bowl, PB&J smoothie! The zoodles with vegan bolognese was spectacular!"

No matter the occasion Roots is the place to be!!"

Their smoothies are great - Pitaya is my favorite! Their acai bowls are also amazing! I also can't get enough of their squash soup - it's made without cream just the vegetable since it's vegan. I've also had their lentil bowl. Everything is so good and best part, healthy!  Highly recommend for a nice refreshing meal, you won't be disappointed."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So very pleased to have an organic vegan spot in West Kendall. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is peaceful. Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious, never too pricey. I just hope they continue the all organic everything movement. Some places start of organic then start slacking. I really appreciate healthy and organic food that I don't have to cook myself all the time. Keep up the amazing job!"

The food is healthy and delicious, they have a variety of vegan choices, and the it's clean! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Now everyone seems to be raving over the dragon bowl, which is amazing, but my recommendations are either the fajita bowl or quinoa bowl paired with a pb+j smoothie. However, I have no doubts that anything you order won't be amazing."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm so glad a place like this opened up in Kendall close to where I live. This spot is perfect for a healthy/vegan/organic meal, snack, juice or smoothie. I wish I could eat here everyday! Roots is a small, modern, and very clean juice bar with a variety of options. I tried the fresh pressed juice named Verde I was worried I wouldn't find a juice without ginger (I'm not a fan) but they had several juices without it so I was pretty happy! As far as food, my favorites so far have been the quinoa bowl, acai bowl, dragon bowl, and avocado toast. I highly suggest you try the dragon bowl...so delicious! The owners are fully devoted in pleasing the customers. They are friendly and attentive and will give discounts for advertising their business on social media."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not a vegan, I'm not a vegetarian, not even close. But this place is amazing. I crave it. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll crave meat too but I don't feel as good after eating meat the way I do after I eat here. What you're looking at in this picture is the acai bowl and the avocado toast. I've also have had the quinoa bowl, lentil bowl and the dragon bowl. They've never missed the mark."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've gone twice this week, Monday being my first time. This place came highly recommended by a few people being that I'm always looking for vegan places and live in Kendall.. Omg. This place is phenomenal. Love the location, the food, the service! Only downfalls are (like all vegan restaurants) it's very pricey (but worth it) and it's very small, not enough seating. But that didn't mean I wasn't going to give this place anything less than 5 stars. I'm so happy it's so close to me, will be going there to often lol."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"What do you mean there's no meat!? I just had the frijole bowl and it was absolute fire. Portions didn't appear to be too challenging however, it fills you up fast. Barely able to withstand another bite, I mustered up the strength finish the last yummy morsel. The kind staff made for pleasant vibes. I may not be a vegan, but I can get used to eating like this especially if I get a free juice/smoothie for my loyalty."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a nice little place to get some healthy vegan meals and fresh raw juices. There isn't much seating, so if you come when it's busy you may choose to take your food with you. The prices are reasonable and the food is all healthy and tasty, the staff seem friendly and the overall vibe is nice. If you want a refreshing juice or a healthy place to eat as a vegan or vegetarian in Kendall this one is it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a rare find for me in Kendall, a cozy juice/smoothie bar with lots of organic and vegan breakfast/lunch/dinner options. I enjoyed the seating options inside and outside. ,I had the kidney bean dish with brown rice, asparagus and avocado/tomato toppings and it was really tasty. Like out of gramma's kitchen. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. ,I also had the crave smoothie, which was a little banana-y for my taste- I kinda wish it had more cacao taste, BUT it was my first time trying and when I go back I plan to try a new smoothie (the hot pink dragon fruit smoothie interested me) and maybe re-order the crave smoothie and ask for them to add more cacao flavor. I forgot to take a pic :( next time. I'll be back for sure."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Absolutely amazing! My favorite is the Quinoa bowl. The food is so fresh and delicious and I'm not even Vegan.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,What a cute little vegan spot. And its conveniently located near my gym. The smoothies are so delicious. I love anything tropical and these smoothies are as tropical as they can get. Will definitely be stopping by often. Pitaya super smoothie is the bomb!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I cant remember if its vegetarian or full vegan but even if youre not - like me- you will feel inspired by the ambiance of kumbaya. There is a tree in the middle of the communal table. There all these inspirational messages around this tiny yet airy locale, the staff is adorably passionate about the products and DO NOT be fooled by the wholesome good organic ingredients- these people have found a way to delight your tastebuds while lovingly reminding you to love all living things. My daughter had a mango smoothie and it was like none I have ever had. It was sophisticated and thick and yes- spicy. I dont even like spicy. But this. This was beautiful. It wasnt cheap -like $8 but like a great meal.  So satisfying. The hours are strict though - closed by 630p weekdays and must check weekend times. But it was clearly a nod to holistic living where we all equally respect and enjoy time. Next time we are trying the smoothie bowls which people keep raving about. But I feel like I gotta fast for two days first - to be deserving of such holy fare. To make room for the calories. (Lets not confuse healthy ingredients for low calorie ones - hahahaha!). Oh yes. We are going back."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"WOW!!!! What an amazing place and within walking distance of my office! Roots is a small, quaint and modern juicebar that makes all of their own juices daily with the freshest of ingredients. They bottle their juices but can make a smoothie or other juice for you on request too. They serve vegan sustainable food that is absolutely delicious! I had the Lentil bowl and not only did it fill me up, but it was full of flavor! I had their ""Cooler"" green drink which is a blend of Fennel Root, Basil, Cucumber, Lime, and Apple. It was absolutely amazing! I took a Cashew milk to go and also their Avocado toast. The owner said that if I just call him he can deliver the food to me on the days that I work which I think is really awesome. ,It's really nice to have local places like this that serve a variety of different and highly nutritious food. They are so passionate about what they do and tell you the health benefits of everything in their food. NSU employees get a discount too! (Although the discount for checking in on Yelp is better :) ,I am looking forward to having healthy lunches and post-workout drinks/meals now. This place was really awesome! It's definitely small and cannot seat that many people, but it's such a great place!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/24/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Finally the Kendall area has a healthy vegan place! The wellness smoothie... amazing!  The avocado Toast is good for anytime of the day, I recommend and try the superfood salad, it's very good and it also has avocado. I definitely enjoy this place, the atmosphere, the service and the food so many great nutrients, loving roots."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I absolutely love this place. Vegan food is delicious and they are super dog friendly. I went there the other day and was with my baby and dog, stressed out and hungry. Not only did they carry my food out but they went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and okay. Thank you for caring so much about your customers, the animals and the planet! Businesses that do good like this get great karma points. Namaste!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/14/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,It's a small cute little vegan Juicebar . Options are great so was the food! The only problem is the prices just a little high.Other  than that  definitely would recomend !
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Maybe it was conditioning today or the run @richie.ramirez_  took me on after training... but I was starving and could not make up my mind... so I got the Frijoles bowl (my fav) for post work out lunch and a Zoodles bowl with vegan bolognese for dinner later.. along with Love Potion #9  all thanks to @rootsjuice for making veggies taste sooo good! Thank you @rootsjuice Love you guys. Stop by for a snack, lunch or a great Acai bowl they got it all."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was looking for a neighborhood place that serves a non dairy option for cappuccinos. I found Roots on google so i gave it a shot. I loved my almond milk cappuccino and cant wait to try them for breakfast or lunch. Such interesting options that fit perfectly into my vegan diet. I appreciate having a healthier choice of food in Miami so thanks Roots for opening close to me. ,I keep coming back for more because the food is so craveable. I love love love everything!!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is such a godsend in kendall where there aren't many vegan/gluten free options (or even relatively healthy options for that matter). Only wish their hours of operation were a bit later. My favorite is the zucchini spaghetti!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I like this juice bar.  The dragon bowl and acai bowl are good.  The salads and smoothies are good too.  I just hate it's so far and in the middle of traffic armageddon lol.  But it is worth going to.  I had the avocado toast, it was ok.  Great place for vegans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,There's no better vegan spot in Miami than Roots. Best Pitaya Juices and bowls in town. The staff is beyond 5 stars. Highly recommended!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/30/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've been vegan now for 4 months and roots has made it so easy! I've been to roots now at least every other week and every visit has been an overall great experience. I've had almost everything on the menu but their breakfast has to be my favorite. Their bowls both the acai and dragon fruit are perfection and the avocado toast is heaven ! Their juices are also a great pick me up, I've had the ""got the beet"" but the ""rise and shine"" is my favorite. My work hours don't usually allow me to swing by for lunch but I've been able to try the fajita bowl and it was very filling the portion size was great and it was perfectly seasoned ! ,The food isn't the only thing I love about roots the ambiance really is what keeps me coming back. From the books put out for guests to read as they wait for their food to the cute foliage put out on the tables it all makes me want to spend my entire day there. On my last visit I saw that it was quite packed and I was very happy to see them doing so well I hope people continue to grow interest in health conscious food. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 starts is because I have heard from people I recommended Roots to that the customer service could be better and up to a certain extent I would have to agree. With that said though Roots is just what Kendall needed may their success be more than they ever expected !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/11/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is very good. There isn't any vegan places around Kendall so this is a great option. Around lunch time it gets packed because the place isn't big but the food truly is delicious. Their avocado toast is probably my favorite and their dragon bowl. They accept Apple Pay so it's convenient. They have very good pre-made juices and shots as well.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This is currently my favorite vegan restaurant in Miami. The bowls are delicious. The juices are phenomenal. The service is excellent. Just wish they had another location further east. Love love love it!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/6/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Super healthy, awesome, delicious, vegan, gluten free place in south Miami just a few steps from LA Fitness, great location and food is delicious, avocado toast is my favorite, summer feels delicious with places like Roots. Also their juices and acai bowls are great!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,I am literally obsessed with everything they offer!! I'm vegan and my boyfriend is a flexitarian; we both love the flavors this place offers in their food!! My only problem is that it is so out of my way lol im never in this area but maybe its for the best because i would probably eat there every day!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm a vegan. Hands down the best Vegan restaurant in Miami! The prices are fair and the quality is outstandingly great. The ambience is very chill and cool. Other than the place being small, everything is amazing!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/30/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've recently become a vegan and my friend recommend me to come here after my workout. Let me tell you how amazing the food is here. I always leave here feeling good. I had the frijoles bowl with brown rice, asparagus, chopped up tomatoes and avocados. Very yummy! Also, their smoothies are delicious. A little pricey but worth the try! Recommend for smoothie: Pitaya and the Crave Smoothie."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Was craving an Acai bowl, and saw all the raves about this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. They did not disappoint. I had their regular acai bowl with their vegan smart vanilla protein powder added in. It was so good! I really liked the option of adding protein powder because I had never seen that before. I definitely will be coming back! Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Can't believe it has taken me this long to find this place!  As a vegan I felt out of luck looking for a great place to dine in Kendall.  Scrolling through Instagram I came upon a picture of the Frijoles bowl (my favorite food on the menu) I am glad I found it. ,It is a quick and go place so not restaurant but as the titles suggest it's a bar so just a few tables to dine. Staff was very friendly and made suggestions as it was my first time.  Staff also asked how was if my food selection was what i was expecting , showing how much they care about customers feedback.  The hours are not as convenient for me as a full time employee but gives me a reason to get up early on the weekends."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Kendall has a hot new vegan spot. Good location and easy to reach.,Their salads are so fresh and made with a great combo of ingredients. ,Prices are good except for their $8 per juice. $5 is what they should go for.,I still give them 5-stars because the food is so good and this is a true ""healthy vegetarian"" place since so many other vegan restaurants have so many carb-filled bread and pasta dishes where this place focuses on vegetables and beans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/19/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this place. Great salad, lentil bowl, vegan deserts, and juices. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is a positive vibe."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/13/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I come to this place as often as I possibly can! They never disappoint and they have such a friendly staff! My staples here are The Crave smoothie, the Acai bowl, and the Avocado Toast ! Also, if it's available, a slice of their vegan carrot cake is my obsession!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Quality quality quality!!!! This is one of the very few all natural all organic all vegan places in Kendall. It's easy to tell it's in high demand because they always have a line out the door! I always order ahead but there food and smoothies are amazing and definitely worth the money! Feels like you're doing your body good! Get more locations!!! Or a bigger space!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem quite daunting and complicated. For me it's about making one change at a time and not all at once. This vegan friendly restaurant is my go-to the days I don't feel creative in the kitchen or right out have no clue what I'm going to cook that day. It's a 20 minute drive from my home but well worth it. There are no words to describe how good everything on the menu is and I mean everything!! My favorites are the Dragon Bowl for breakfast and Zoodles Bowl for lunch. If you want to feel brand new eat @ Roots. Your body will definitely thank you!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this vegan juice bar/ cafe. They have great options are different types of juice and healthy snack juices like acai bowl, dragon bowl, quinoa bowl and avocado toast. Not only the food is delicious, people are friendly, it's a perfect Instagram spot as well. ;),I tried the dragon bowl, it's huge and sosososo good! I didn't expect a layer of granola at the bottom too. Love it! The granola is no generic, full of flavor and various seeds. ,Will come back to try other stuff for sure!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love roots juice bar, it's one of my favorite places to eat usually on Sunday's for lunch (They changed their times and they're opened every day now which is a plus!).I usually get the lentil bowl, and it comes with brown rice and a side of veggies. I have tried most of their food bowls on their menu, and all of them are delicious! Their vegan chocolate cake is amazing! Also, they do have signs by the register that states that food may take up to 20 mins just because their food is served fresh, so there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Excellent vegan place!! The food is great and very healthy. The avocado toast is amazing and every dish is fresh and delicious. I wish there are more Roots locations. A must!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I received an add from Yelp, telling me about healthy eating places near me, so I decided to give this place a try, I'm not really a vegan but really enjoy healthy foods. Wanting to give his local place a try I ordered a few things, Dragon bowl... delicious, Morning Bagel... WOW, Lentil bowl....double WOW, I also decided to try the Avocado Toast because all the reviews ranted about it, I think it was too salty, a little less salty & I think it will be great. Overall the food was a total success, I will definitely be coming back to try some more items from their menu"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I came out to Miami during my sister's best friend's wedding. This place happened to be next to the hotel we were staying at, so I decided why not give this place a try? This is a raw vegan restaurant and juice bar, although they cook their food. For my meal I had the zucchini noodles with vegan Bolognese and a green soup. I really enjoyed the zucchini pasta (zoodles) because they really fill you up and trick your brain into thinking your eating spaghetti. The Vegan Bolognese was very thick and chunky in consistency like its traditional meat counterpart. My green soup was very well seasoned and I could appreciate the distinct taste of broccoli in it. The staff here are incredibly friendly. The day I came in, the place was packed with a line out the door and despite this the nice girl at the counter stopped what she was doing for a moment and gave me a knife when I asked for one. I don't go to Miami very much, but if I do, I will be sure to stop by here again to try more of their items!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been hesitant to try this place due to the location being in a very heavy traffic area. Recently I stopped by for the first time and I was really impressed with the place. I ordered a dragon fruit smoothie, a bagel with vegan cream cheese and a vegetable soup and everything was delicious. Making a healthy vegetable soup is hard to do and they do it so well. I love that they use organic ingredients and environmentally friendly to go packaging. This is a great spot if you're looking for a healthy or organic option."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"One of my favorite vegan spots in south miami. My favorite is the bean bowl and zucchini pasta. Not once have I been disappointed when I go to this place. Everything from the juice, smoothies, food and dessert never disappoints. Very attentive staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/9/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing service . Staff had excellent knowledge of everything and let us try different fruit because adding it in the smoothie. This is a hole in the wall because I would've never noticed if it was for a friend who recently went from vegetarian to vegan and wanted to try this from Yelp reviews. ,It's very peaceful and quiet. Parking says 1 hour only."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love this place! I am excited to find places like this (Vegan/Vegetarian options!) in Miami / Kendall area! The atmosphere is very nice, have many options on their menu. I had the Quinoa bowl and Love potion (beet, pineapple, pear, ginger, chia) juice!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So i'm not vegan or even health-conscious over my food, but after having a friend talk my ear off about how much she was craving an acai bowl, i decided i must try one for myself. ,Roots is not at all on my way. I happened to be in the area and Yelp recommended them when i searched for a local Juice Bar. ,Let me tell you, i am so glad i stopped in here. The atmosphere is adorable: trendy white couch, stool seating along the windows, and a communal picnic table with an artificial tree sprouting in the middle. There's open cooler with fresh beds of wheatgrass, their pressed and bottled juices, and other assorted drinks. The kitchen is partially visible from the register so you can see most goings-on with your food. Their menu can be found on clipboards all around the shop so ordering is more expedient. ,I ordered the Acai Bowl and their Lentil Bowl. Immediately, the young woman said I made good choices but that it would be a lot of food if it was all just for me. I absolutely loved that. I let her know that I was planning on eating the Lentil Bowl later in the day, and asked if it would keep until then. She rang me up and said she'd fulfill the acai bowl order first and whenever i felt it was a good time to go, she'd fulfill the lentil bowl order so i could leave with the freshest food.,The Acai Bowl was the first i've ever had, and i may have ruined myself for any other. Their portions are large and filling; their toppings are liberal and a real treat. The bowl had a multitude of toppings, but also the bottom of the bowl had a generous layer of granola and chia seeds. It was definitely my happiest food experience in 2016. Every spoonful was savored and by the time i was near finished, a gentlemen had dropped off a warm brown bag with my lentil bowl. ,So in the end, I've been trying to give myself an excuse to get back into this area and stop by Roots again. 5/5 in everything: quality, service, value. No other bowls have met my standards."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/4/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,So far I have been here twice and each time I really did enjoy it. The first time around I ordered a smoothie and the avocado toast. My husband and I really enjoyed both. The second time around we did have one of their bowls which was pretty tasty. I do like the vibe in there. It can be a little to warm in there though. I definitely plan on going back again. It is a great healthy option regardless if you are vegan or vegetarian or not.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts. 100%recommended."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Best vegan/healthy food in town. I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Incredible. Shared the fajita bowl (without the spicy peppers), avocado toast, and a butternut squash soup and it was AMAZING! Even my non-vegan family member thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back.,Also, the presentation was so cute! I'm just digging everything about it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/20/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Such a cute little juice bar! I live in the area but only recently heard about it. When I heard there was an a vegan all plant-based foodie heaven near me I was all about it. I didn't want to get my hopes up as far as taste because I feel I am really picky. I ordered the lentil bowl and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. The lentil bowl comes with brown rice, broccoli, zucchini and carrots - can't complain. I'll be back to try juice and breakfast bagel."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great Vegan Friendly options. Very clean and friendly staff.  Food was really tasty. I recommend the Quinua Bowl, the Bean Bowl, and the Açaí bowl."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super fresh and tasty. Made me feel more alive when I ate this food. Great variety and high quality food. Definitely one of the best vegan/vegetarian spots in this area. Wish that there was more space to sit inside.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/26/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The customer service and cleanliness of this place is impeccable. Loved its all plant-based menu. It's a must-go for vegans and vegetarians in the Kendall area.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"A solid 4.5 stars...This juice bar is exactly what West Kendall needed. Its fast, delicious, convenient, and vegan. It's tucked away in a shopping center behind a hotel so it's hard to find. But no worries, plug it in your GPS and it takes you right there. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Very simple and inviting décor. They have an array of juices and smoothies. Their food menu is small but definitely not lacking in flavor. All the menu items are plant based and for the most part organic. ,I tried: ,Avocado toast: The flavor was delicious. I just wish the avocado had thicker chunks and not have so much of a creamy consistency. The addition of the chia seeds were exceptional and gave it the final touch. ,Vegetable soup: Once again amazing flavor but I felt all I got were blended vegetables. I like when there is heartiness in my soup and I can actually crunch on a vegetable or two. ,Dragonfruit Acai Bowl: O.M.G! Best bowl I have ever had! Hands down. The toppings were so delicious. Banana, strawberry, kiwi, blueberries, coconut chips, granola, and chia seeds decorated the bowl beautifully and sat on top of the perfectly blended dragon fruit. Its a must order. ,and last but not least....The wonderful Lentil Bowl: I loved this so much. The lentils were so so so good! I tip my hat off to the wonderful person who seasoned this dish so beautifully. This bowl comes with a heeping serving of lentils, brown rice, and grilled vegetables. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Portions were the perfect size. ,I will definitely be coming back to this location. I know for sure I will be ordering The dragonfruit bowl and the Lentil Bowl. Two delicious concoctions that are worth trying! ,Cannot wait to try their juices. ,P.S. parking can be a bit of a pain. Don't fret, when you drive into the small plaza there is more parking if you keep driving straight."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/15/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been working on going vegan for some time now and the food here is AMAZING! I am a fan of the dragon fruit bowl, coffee, and fajita bowl! They are expensive but most health food places are so it is expected. ,I have to take out two stars, not because of the food (which I encourage everyone to go try), but because of the customer service. I have realized they are becoming more popular and now are much more frantic, making more mistakes and, even making rude comments at times.  Many times, when I call in to place an order to avoid waiting in the crowded little seating area, they don't pick up. I recently mentioned this to one of the employees (I think he could have been the manager, but I am not sure), and he told me ""I can't do 5 things at once!"" I think they lack a little bit of professionalism, but it's still great food in a convenient area close to where I live. so mehhhh..."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/21/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is right by school and it's pretty great. It is only vegan so they do not have many options although I love vegan foods. I got a avocado/kale salad of some sort with a spicy sauce. That was delicious! Downside part of this place is the wait and how busy it gets! A tip would probably be to open up earlier
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Ok, so I had not tried an Acai bowl because as most things are now in days I thought it was a fad hipster dish. I thought it's a smoothie in a bowl how great can that be...OMG WAS I WRONG. Yes, to some people it's still a fad to go vegan because that is the cool thing now in days, I'm not vegan but I do have a plant based diet day a week. The acai bowl is toooo die for. I can die and go to heaven now, so so so good! I don't even have words to describe the perfection that the acai bowl is. I'm going to try the avocado toast next time I come here."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Being a vegan, I can tell you this place is a great spot! They have delicious food bowls, my favorite being the Dragon bowl! They also have several other lunch items that are extremely tasty and fresh, I would definitely recommend the zoodles and avocado toast... their desserts are also amazing, most of them are vegan and again, very very tasty! I have tried several of their smoothies and they are also very fresh, made to order, and absolutely delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/12/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is Vegan but you don't need to be Vegan to eat here! This place's menu is EXTREMELY good. I have been there more than 12 times this year alone (it's a little far from my house but if i could go more I would) The açaí bowls are so refreshing and make you feel satisfyingly full because of how healthy it is. The peanut butter smoothie is fantastic (I'm not really a big fan of peanut butter but I still get it) the people are always welcoming and sweet. I really enjoy the environment as well, it's a cute little place and you can sit around outside as well. This is my favorite place to eat. I'm not the healthiest person in the world but I really do crave the açaí bowls often."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am writing this review purely from the point of view as a customer, I used to work here a year ago and I will not relate my work experience to the establishment... The menu has a nice variety of choices to get, my favorite are the wellness smoothie (a fresh tasting green smoothie) and the crave smoothie(vanilla/cinnamon goodness). Another favorite of mine are the zoodles (zuccinni  noodles), they are served with a vegan bolognese sauce. I used to use the Yelp check in/20% off when I would come here but now they are saying they aren't accepting it anymore. If that is the case, take it off Yelp because it is misleading. This visit I ordered an avocado toast and a crave smoothie. The toast came out quickly but 15 minutes later I'm still here waiting for my smoothie while the girls behind the counter chat about stair masters and working out, usually they bring the food all together. As of customer service, associates could be friendlier maybe try smiling. Vegan = HAPPY"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/23/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,the time to get the food  it is my only concern...every thing else it is GOOODD AND FRESH.. i highly recommended to any vegan friends
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not vegan by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I do love my smoothies & bowls and Roots delivers on both! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl. I've had Dragon/Pitaya bowls around the US and even internationally. And in my opinion Roots' version is the best. All the toppings work well together and everything is o nicely presented. ,I have also tried their juice cleanse 2x. I do pretty well on 3 day cleanses with rarely a headache. They will offer suggestions on how to deal with any effects. The first time, I received all clear juices. The 2nd time, I received some of the same juices plus one thicker juice and one cash mylk. I think that the addition of the thicker drinks should help those that have a hard time with cleanses as the thicker juices/mylk are pretty filling.  ,The avocado juice was delish and the cash mylk was also tasty. I do not like celery and three of the juices contain celery. The green ones I chugged. While the beet juice was more palatable. I loved the morning juice.  Mind you, this is just my personal opinion. All in all, it was a great cleanse.,I have been coming here since it was the place for the best cuppie cakes on the planet (cough, cough). And the staff and owners have always been super friendly and welcoming. The shop is so cute and offers seating both inside & out. Orders are prepared once placed so if you are in a rush, you can place your order online right here on Yelp! And it will be ready for you to pick up."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Hands down my favorite Vegan Food Spot in Miami! My favorite thing is the ""Fajitas Bowl"" and the Love Potion #9 Juice. I also like the Frijoles Bowl and Dragon Fruit Bowl. The place is small but I love it inside. The atmosphere is good and everything is made to order so it tastes very fresh. I hope that they open up more restaurants in the near future and they should really think about opening on Sundays."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Roots is a very tasty juice bar, it has all the vegan favorites. I'm not vegan but I do like from time to time a healthy alternative. ,One of my side jobs is next door so it makes a nice and convenient meal/shake for me during my lunch break. ,I usually have my favorite the PB&j shake. Very tasty and full of flavor. ,If you've never had Avo bread before make sure you ask for it. It's tasteful and light! It'll sure make your tastebuds happy. ,If in the area and looking for something healthy and different try Roots out. It's sure not to disappoint"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/9/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,My go-to place for acai/dragon bowls and healthy vegan food. Everything I've tried was delicious. The place is also very cute and simple and the service is great.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Very clean great smoothies great juices. Great food . Highly recommend vegan or vegaterian or just healthy. I have been here a few times now and the food is always delicious. I love the lentil bowl, and you get so much! It is a little expensive but these types of places always seem to be. Love that the menu is all vegan, makes it so easy to order.Had the kale juice and a comfort bowl for my wife. They were both good. ,PS: Pet friendly."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First time customer, went in for the Açaí bowl but they were out. Chose the Dragon bowl instead--very appealing to the eyes and delicious to the palate, and very filling too. The music played there was a little too loud if trying to have a conversation with friends, but otherwise a perfect place to hangout. Love the vegan themed art & decor. Friendly staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOVE! The food is delicious, nutritious and eco-friendly. The service is super fast and friendly and the environment/ decor is awesome (they always play the best music too). I am a huge fan of their menu, which is 100% vegan (and I'm not even vegan). I highly recommend the frijoles bowl, the morning bagel and the dragon bowl...YUM! Also, if you're ever feeling sick, take one of their ""good and well"" natural juice shots. It has cayenne pepper in it, so if you're not comfortable with spice, you may want to stay away. But seriously, I've started taking these shots when I'm sick and they make me feel SO much better! Overall, a great go-to place for delicious, healthy, feel-good food and great service."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I honesty have to thank the owner for this change. I remembered this place having sweets and I had no Idea I had a vegan friendly restaurant right around the corner. I am transitioning into veganism after getting educated and realizing the damaging affects of processed foods, meats and dairy. Was so happy to find out the food was not only delicious but wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. I love the story of this place and the fact that it cares about what they provide you with. The juices are expensive yes but do have a blend of a lot of different things that help your nutrition . I'm your new loyal customer and can't wait to order more meals throughout my week! ,Thank you! :),P.S. Please make a loyalty program!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I went for the first time today and I'm definitely going back! I loved all the vegan options! Considering most vegan places are on the pricier end, I didn't think this place was so bad. I had the Pitaya smoothie with dragon fruit, mango banana etc. this vibrant drink was tasty and very filling. I can't wait to go and try some of their food."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/11/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First I'd like to make clear that I am NOT a vegan, and I had no idea this was a vegan place, but that didn't deter me from trying out their smoothies. They clearly have a fan base, because at 930 AM when they open there was already lines. , I decided to try a Crave smoothie consisting of Vanilla bean, dates, bananas, cinnamon, chia seeds, cacao and Almond milk. It wasn't bad. I also ordered the Breakfast Bagel with Cashew Cream cheese and spinach on a wheat bagel. I knew I would like the bagel, because I love anything with Cashew, I wasn't crazy about the spinach but I ate it anyways ( my first time ever eating spinach) , I respect other people's choices of what they put in their bodies, but I couldn't live on a vegan diet. It's a very nice small place with lots of employees, the service was friendly and I can see myself returning to try some of their cold pressed juices.,I tried their cold pressed juices and I didn't care for them. Ginger is too overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the RISE & SHINE Juice. ,Also I wonder why ""healthy"" food is so expensive if it doesn't contain many of the preservatives and ingredients as ""unhealthy"" food does. I imagine less ingredients less spendings."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Please visit this place whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, you will fall in love with the food, açaí bowls as well as the cozy, coffee shop ambience. Try the frijoles bowl and the avocado toast."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super good Vegan place in West Kendall. Try the bowls and the juices. The avocado toast is super delicious as well. #savetheanimals
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is pretty awesome. Their menu ranges from options of lentil soups, to sandwiches, salads, juices, energy bowls, and anything in between. It's a vegan's heaven. It is a bit pricey, but that expected at most of these health and ethically conscious restaurants. I still have a ton of meals to try out on their menu, and so far I've loved their lentils, dragon bowls, avocado toast, juices, smoothies, and a few other options-basically everything has been great thus far. ,I like to come here often, usually whenever I'm in the Kendall area. Whenever I bike or drive out to the Kendall Regal Village, I like to grab a bite to eat here if I'm hungry, especially if I have just finished a workout at the LA Fitness, or finished a film at the theater, or finished picking up art supplies at Michael's, or have been spending my afternoon at Barnes & Nobles. Honestly this little mall plaza has just about everything I love, and it's my own personal escape on Kendall Drive. So the location of this vegan restaurant just makes it that much better. I used to come here a lot more back when I worked in the area, but I still come here often enough because of my gym membership and the other stores. I'm surprised it took so long for me to write a review. ,Parking is free and it's a private lot. There's also bike parking, so it's perfect. And free wifi! So between here and the Barnes & Nobles, it's a great location to study or read if you want to get a change of scenery from the library or your house. ,The staff is friendly and I enjoy their service. No complaints. You do get 20% off of your purchase on check-in, so keep that handy! ,I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here, as I've been trying to introduce him to more vegan options and vegan restaurants. It's difficult to convince him because he eats meat and is stubborn, but when I come with him I will recommend he gets one of their higher calorie/higher protein options, since that's his main hesitation to vegan food-he thinks it's not enough calories or protein for the price, especially for someone like him who is trying to gain weight. *sigh* There are plenty of options for everyone, even for those who work out and are looking for plant based protein.  ,Overall it's a great experience, tasty and healthy vegan food, great location and convenience of being right off Kendall Drive, and free bike and car parking. Did I mention how that is so perfect? They take card and cash, too. I only wish they stayed open later."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/9/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I yelped ""salads"" and this place popped up. On the drive there, I was excited to have found a place like this in Kendall (when I think juice bar and vegan, I think Miami Beach). The cashier was kind and made a suggestion for my order. I am always happy to hear suggestions, especially when it's my first time. I ordered a caramel macchiato (with almond milk--as per her recommendation) and it was delicious! Not bitter, not overly sweet. I also ordered an avocado toast--light yet satisfying. I tend to go overboard with new things so I fully intend to go back tomorrow to try a smoothie! ,My one complaint is how tiny the space is! There isn't much space to wait for your meal if it's to go. If you choose to dine-in, the seating is very VERY limited. Granted, this was lunch time so I completely understand. I will return during non-peak hours."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/3/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely love the acai bowls from roots. They are reasonably priced, have tons of toppings and tastes delicious! The shop is really nice and clean inside, however, it is kind of small which makes it feel very cramped when it is very busy. There's not so many places to sit so I always opt for take out. The best way to do take out here is to either call ahead or order through yelp because there's not too much space to wait around if it's very busy. Made that mistake once and felt super claustrophobic. There isn't that much seating, there's a little community table which is cute but when the line gets long it feels like people are right on top of you. The decorations and style of the place are cute though. Definitely a cute little spot to hang out if it's not busy but if it is I would come back later or do take out. The food is definitely worth it though. It's one of the only vegan/juice bars in the area that have fresh fruits and are good quality without being overpriced."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Delicious place! Smoothies are alright, but let me tel you! THAT FAJITA BOWL WAS AMAZING!!! Prices were pretty average for a juice bar, not bad. staff was very friendly and attentive and hardworking! This place is a beautiful place spreading the vegan message. I like the steps towards being more green. Also I love that they had vegan smoothie bowls! Food was good, the smoothie was just what I needed!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan, but I love the food they serve at this place. Whoever is the owner really did a good job when hiring the chef. Also, I would like to know which coffee do you use? Where is it from? Because I enjoyed it! I have tried almost each one of the meals in their menu and have liked all of them!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"GO TO ROOTS JUICEBAR! I have tried almost every vegan place in Miami and Roots is by far, my favorite place to eat at. Compare all the prices for an acai bowl between every vegan place and look back at Roots. It is very affordable and their food will fill you up. They have a variety of meals and smoothies, which makes them my go-to when I am near kendall. I am excited for their new location opening in Doral."
"5744 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33146",3/8/2017,$,5,Kappa Rolls and Bowls,"Probably the best combination of convenient and great food in the area. Very easy to order and the employees are very helpful. Food comes out to you fresh and very quickly after you order. I get a vegetable bowl with rice, a salad, and a soup for less than $10! You can't beat that. Most importantly it is vegan friendly, which is sometimes hard to find at these types of restaurants. If I had to say one bad thing it would probably have to be the parking, but comparatively to Miami Beach it is a breeze. A must go to for anyone looking to great food in the area!"
"11752 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",11/13/2017,$$,5,Shawarma Mediterranean Grill,"Beautiful small joint and the people are friendly. Great services and of course, the food is great. Feeling vegan? Yes, there is a plate for that."
"8422 Mills Dr, Miami, FL 33183",9/18/2016,$,5,Ken’s Healthy Delights,"Recently, decided to go vegetarian and felt like eating a salad yesterday. Kendall doesn't have a lot of healthy or ""vegan"" options so I went to Giardino and realized how ridiculously over priced they are for what they offer and left. In my search I came across this awesome place and was impressed by their price, variety, and veggie selection. I will most definitely be returning to this establishment. So grateful that healthier and affordable ""fast food"" options are opening in Kendall."
"8422 Mills Dr, Miami, FL 33183",9/20/2017,$,5,Ken’s Healthy Delights,"Looking to transitioning to veganism but not quite their yet  found this spot while trying to fuel my body with real food for a change. Got a chicken salad wrap (more flexitarian for today) and it was awesome!! Also got a dancing princess smoothie that is Delish  and I'm really not a smoothie person. Shannon is great! Never stopped working and cleaning the whole time I was here and let me taste a smoothie she was making for someone else and let them taste the one she made for me. Great way to bring us all back for more because both smoothies were pretty awesome.,I'm feeling amazing already  great choice and will become my new go-to for healthy options. Greatly needed around these parts too."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2012,$,4,La Latina,"This place is super cute!  It is a small, unassuming place on the outside, but very warm, friendly and inviting on the inside! They use gluten free products and meat without any hormones, etc. and they are starting to serve vegan mini cupcakes from Bunnie's.  ,Hubs and I tried a variety of things - Pabellon empanada, cheese & sweet plantains empanada, the Reina Pepeida and the Pelua arepas.  My favorite was the Reina Pepeida arepa.  It's seriously filled to the brim with a creamy chicken salad (creamy from the avocado - heavenly!),The decor is like you stepped into your Abuela's (grandma!) house and you're plopping down at the kitchen table for an afternoon snack.  ,Tasty, cheap and fun."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We LOVE this place. The arepas are INCREDIBLE; it's fast, so cheap, AND they catered a big party for us and were extremely professional / organized / on-time. They even have a vegan/vegetarian menu (although, it's kind of lost on me.) They don't skimp on the meat/cheese and the sauces are OUT of this world."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/1/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We came here after the House of Roots kava bar. Although small, don't let it fool you, this place makes incredible arepas for various eaters from vegan to your average meat eater. My boyfriend had the beef arepa as did his friend. This was a nice stop along way before heading over to the Secret Garden Halloween party. I ordered the cheese and avocado arepa. It was so fresh and just mouth watering. We also shared the cheese sticks that his friend ordered. ,I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area even though I'm not a fan of where the restaurant actually is. We didn't have a hard time parking but it's in an area where cars are zooming past and since its Miami, of course, certain drivers can be a bit reckless from time to time. It also didn't help that it was raining like crazy. ,The decorations of this place are gorgeous. It reminded me of what it was like back when I visited Mexico. The colors were pastel and beige. Everything just blended in so nicely. ,I highly recommend bringing a date, a friend, or even a small group before going out or even during the day when it's nice and sunny since it'll be better. There's also a brewery around the corner where you can get a drink after enjoying the delicacies of some avant garde arepas."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/13/2018,$,5,La Latina,"This place is a hidden gem. I ordered the bean and avocado arepa and it was delicious. They have vegan options available. The place itself it's interesting, they have cute old fashion hispanic decorations that takes me back to my cuban childhood."
