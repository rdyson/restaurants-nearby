"350 NW 8th Ave, Miami, FL 33128",11/26/2017,$$,4,Miami River Cafe,"Vegetarian and Vegan options found here ,Homemade tortillas always steal my heart, and theirs are on point. Delicious!,Homemade salsas and beans. Elotes (street fair corn on the cob) are a must and Margaritas were also so good at only $4 bucks. Chill atmosphere with Latin music playing, which is always a plus, in my opinion ;). Thumbs up and be back, for sure!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/12/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,Love the variety of food here. Many vegan options. You definitely need to pop over to Chef Chloe for the best ending to your meal. I love that the food hall has a vegan option at almost every vendor. It's awesome to be able to grab a delicious refreshing smoothie and head out to the terrace for a nice swing. Enjoy!
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I really love the concept of this higher end food court with healthy varieties! There's Italian, different types of Asian foods, vegan foods, smoothies and bowls, and a coffee bar just to name a few. I ordered the Ramen and honestly...not good. Avoid that. Bland and way overpriced for what it tasted like. BUT try the Avocado Salad from Chloe's and you'll LOVE it. There's a bar at the center for cocktails and wine and you can get drinks from the different markets. Definitely go with friends, grab drinks, and enjoy!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Really good has about 12 vendors of food . Tacos , vegan cafe ( which was amazing) and Asian food . The have char grilled oysters at another place . My favorite was the vegan cafe (the vegan nachos are amazing ) as wells as the large delicious guacamole salad . Def a must try"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This is an open market with many small food vendors and a bar in the middle. This spot was an awesome experience with friendly chefs rolling fresh pasta, excellent vegan desserts, and yummy cocktails made by friendly bartenders. I would definitely recommend stopping here for a bite while shopping in the awesome boutiques in the area."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Great little food hall with lots of vegan options!!! My boyfriend and I got the spicy tofu banh mi sandwich  at Tran An and the vegan ramen at Yuzu. The sandwich was pretty good (pretty small for the price) but the ramen was to DIE FOR. ,It had tons of wonderful veggies and mushrooms, lots of flavor, and was a huge portion! Pro tip: ask them to split one order into two bowls for you. It's great to share! It was by far the best vegan ramen I've ever had. ,We would've gotten some desserts at Chef Chloe's place but it was late and they had sold out by the time we finished eating dinner. Their treats looked and smelled delicious though! ,Highly recommend this place for great vegan options!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/20/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"St.Roch was our final stop during our Miami trip! I love Chef Chloe and saw on her Instagram that she had opened up a cafe at this new market. Obviously I had told my fiancé that I wanted to check out this place well before we even got to Miami! Lucky for me he made sure we ended our trip with brunch at St.Roch Market. His friends who live in Miami hadn't heard of this food hall yet (I deff felt like an insider lol). St. Roch Market is part of a newly developed high end shopping center. It is modern, has a variety of food vendors (Israeli, sushi, Mexican, Vietnamese, vegan desserts, full bar, coffee shop, Italian, acai bowls/juice shop etc), AND tons of seating! We also saw a birthday party going on- so that's something to keep in mind if you need a place to celebrate.Their eyes almost popped out of their heads as they walked around trying to decide what to eat! I opted for a falafel platter from the Israeli vendor (Jaffa). The food was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully presented! For dessert I obviously went to Chef Chloe's cafe and got a chocolate chip sea salt cookie- chewy, perfect sweet/salty balance & ginormous chips atop the cookie (total win!) The guys tried the sushi, bhan mi sandwich, sushi, Mexican corn, the shawarma platter, and coffee. Everyone loved their food and they can't wait to bring their friends/S.O  #yourwelcome #thanksinstagram"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/4/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So excited about this new food market in the design district! Plenty of ethnic food options for a price that's relatively affordable, especially when considering the design district location! Exciting to have exciting new food options in this food hall, instead of common chains that I'm used to seeing around Miami. Hard to decide between all of the food vendors, especially since all had vegetarian and vegan friendly options. Will be back to try out more!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"I loved this place since I found out about it 3 months ago. It's great to have several different options so everyone in the group is happy, wherever your vegan or a total carnivore like me. I've tried 3 of the places already, and loved the Vietnamese food particularly, but can't wait to try everything since I haven't been disappointed yet. It's great to have both seating outside and inside with beautiful hammock/chairs under canopy of vines."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/2/2018,$$,3,St. Roch Market,"Looks like the food market idea is becoming more popular now. It's a great concept since there's a variety for all taste buds! I ordered ""Yuzu's"" Vegan noodle bowl and it was tasty, good size, but way too pricey. I paid $19, and felt it was a bit absurd for ramens.  My boyfriend had ""Hot Lime"" which is the Mexican Taco spot... he loved it! He had the chicken, the shortie taco with beef short rib, and the vegan taco which were amazing, but they were too small, gone in 2 bites. But we'll definitely be back for the tacos and to try different spots."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So much better than I was expecting! The quality of everything was excellent and so much variety! This is the perfect spot to go to if you're with a group.. there is something for everyone! Oyster bar, juice/smoothie bowl bar, hummus bar, asian fusion, Italian, tacos/ceviche, Vietnamese, vegan bakery, southern soul food.. all top quality."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I'm so glad more food halls are opening in Miami! St. Roch Market (apparently pronounced ""Rock"") is a great addition to Miami's growing roster of food halls. I checked it out this morning after learning about it on Chef Chloe Coscarelli's instagram, where she announced that she will have her own all-vegan stall in the market. , ,The place definitely fits within the Design District. It's a clean open space above Estefan Kitchen with a range of stalls - from asian and italian to coffee and smoothies. , ,I tried a basic açaí bowl from SweetBlendz and was a bit disappointed when I saw that the açaí puree was pre-made - but that quickly changed once I tried a bite and realized how yummy the puree actually is. I'd definitely recommend getting a bowl. It's topped with all kinds of fruit and is a decent size to fill you up. , ,One caveat to the whole place - everything's pretty pricey. My açaí bowl was about $12. A quick browse of the rest of the shops showed similarly high prices. I'll have to try more to see if the prices are worth it! Definitely looking forward to testing Chef Chloe's vegan goodies!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Excellent new spot in the Miami Design District with great options for a variety of cravings. Tacos? Chicken rice? Vegan cupcakes and matcha soft serve? You got it! Also, working on a random day and having some coffee to enjoy the ambiance is a great idea at St. Roch Market. ,Highly recommend the hummus from Jaffa, the peanut butter cookie from Chloe and the coffee from Sabal, of course!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/28/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Came over to St. Roch Market last night with a friend for dinner. I was instantly impressed with the decor and the variety of options it had to offer. From Meditteranean, Italian, Mexican, Vegan and more--with so many options it was hard to choose!,I ended up grabbing some tacos with my friend at the station called Hot Lime. I tried the short rib taco and the pork taco ($10 for two tacos or $14 for three). Absolutely delicious and satisfying! The guac ($9) we ordered as a side was made fresh but I personally didn't feel like the price tag matched the taste. Still good and would definitely recommend trying Hot Lime out.,We later had vegan dessert at Chole which was absolutely delicious! Whatever you do, please order the Strawberry Chocolate Cupcake. Soooo good! It may be vegan but it tastes just like chocolate. Could've fooled me.,On to the service at St. Roch Market...,The only reason I deducted one star was that of the service employees. My friend and I arrive around 7:45 PM on a Tuesday evening, it was not busy whatsoever. However, the bussers kept hovering over us to clean up our plates. We were asked SIX times (in a span of 15-20 mins) if they could remove our plates (which we were nowhere near done) simply because we were talking and enjoying our conversation. We finally gave up and left because of the pushy bussers. Honestly, this was my main complaint. No one wants to be rushed during dinner.,Overall, minus the pushy and annoying bussers, I'd come back to grab a bite soon!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"My crew (my wifey and sister-in-law) and I decided to try the new St. Roch Market in the Miami Design District. It's been open for about a month and it's a nice addition to the district. Its on the second floor of the shopping area and parking is very easy. There's valet or a self park garage. Let me tell you a little about the layout -- it's a food hall. There's about 10 food stands and they all have menus to pick from. There's seafood, chicken and waffles at a stand called ""Coop"". Ramen noodle soup at ""yuzu"". tacos  , chips and fresh made guacamole at ""hot lime"".  There also vegan  options in almost every stand. One of the details I did notice was that the staff working the tables and cleaning were very nice and doing an excellent job keeping the area clean. That's always a plus and The prices were reasonable. ,St. Roch Market is a nice addition to the Miami Design District. I recommend you try it for a afternoon or dinner."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/29/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Okay Eat! By Chloe is the best thing to happen to Miami! I love Vegan food and vegan options and this place has everything you want, but better! I tried the sprinkle cupcake and it tastes like heaven with sprinkles on it! Chocolatey deliciousness! Then the vegan nachos were AMAZING! I'd definitely share next time but also probably not because I ate all of them anyway! They were sweet but also salty and the toppings were perfect. Then the dragonfruit drink was so sour and sweet and perfect for a hot summer day. I wish I can eat here everyday ... maybe I will."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Today was my second time here. Chef Chloe's place is ok... now there's only one savory option and it's the truffle avocado toast. How creative. Before there was a few other things and they were worth the visit, but now those are out. The vegan desserts have been on the dry side, none of them mind blowing. ,However, pretty much all the other vendors have amazing vegan options. Jaffa has plenty of Mediterranean plates and dairy free ice cream flavors. Don't miss out on this place. Healthy food with lots of flavor. ,The Japanese place has vegan sushi rolls which were delicious. ,Happy hour at the bar is great too."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/19/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"So far I've tried a banh mi from Tran An, sushi roll from Itamae, ramen from Yuzu, açaí bowl from Sweetblendz, and desserts and nachos from Chole and the Vegan Cafe. Everything was good, but the only place that really stood out to me was Chole and the Vegan Cafe.,Which also made me realize, this food hall is relatively vegan friendly. There's the obvious Chloe and the Vegan Cafe whose desserts have me thinking about them days later. But also, Yuzu makes a vegan ramen. I'm still on the hunt for a satisfying bowl of ramen in Miami, but the one at Yuzu is not bad (they'll even split it into two bowls if you want to share a few different things with a friend!).,If you're deciding between food halls, I prefer 1-800 Lucky in Wynwood or even Jackson Hall in the Health District. But St. Roch Market definitely fills a niche of its own in the bougie Miami Design District."
"8376 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",6/20/2013,$$,4,Kon Chau Restaurant,"Kon Chau dim sum on a lazy afternoon. This place is understated. Heavy traffic at weekend brunch time, but otherwise peaceful. The food is fast, delicious, and inexpensive. A vegetarian (not vegan) and a meat eater will both leave satisfied. The dining area is simple and unpretentious, unlike many Miami 'pan-Asian cuisine' type places. Dreamy dreamy dim sum is the real deal. ,...and my little brother was digging on the smooth sounds of the 70's."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/16/2014,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,The staff is really friendly and they have the best view in Doral . The selection is very healthy. The pizzas are well done and the salads are delicious . They serve almost everything in to go plastic bowls and cup. I love this place I just wish they were more Eco friendly and have more vegetarian/vegan options ( vegan cheese would be great)
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",12/21/2015,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Healthy and tasty food. Multiple choices for the vegan/healthy conscious oriented eater. ,Friendly service, nice location with a pretty view and they cater and deliver! ,Delivery is fast and accurate. ,Regular customer; will indeed go every day!   ,Will love for them to have a frequent  customer program... ,Great place! Love it!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/8/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Great spot! Healthy. Fresh food. Good view of the water. Would love to see more vegan options, but otherwise A+! :)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",3/2/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,So healthy and so delicious I cant stop eating. Vegan options and all natural and very fresh. Staff is very sweet and welcoming. Love this place.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/22/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've eaten here a couple of times and overall the food is hit or miss, and the service is a little on the slow side. Parking definitely sucks but it is one of the only places offering so many healthy choices especially for people who are vegan/vegetarian/gluten free. The avocado toast is good but there have been times I've gotten a soggy piece of bread with the smallest crumbles of goat cheese on top. Definitely give it a try, especially if you are trying to eat healthy or looking for vegan options! It's a little on the pricey side but everything in Miami is."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/10/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Delicious, great service and chill vibe. We had the avocado tuna salad and vegan colorful salad. Both very yummy. My kids had the pumpkin soup and adashah bowl, which they enjoyed. This was our first visit, but we will be back to try out more if the menu."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2017,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I'm sure that vegans/gluten free people around the world as over joyed over this place! It is very creative and has a variety of items on the menu. However, if you are not vegan, gluten free, low calorie and are on vacation wanting to eat ALL of your calories- choose another pace. Lol. This was great- but this week I am not counting calories so I was an it underwhelmed that was my fault none of the restaurants. Most of the waiters speak Spanish but our waiter was nice explained the menu and we got a picture of mimosa. Oh and the outside view is great(part of the reason why I stayed even though the menu was looking a hit healthier than I anticipated)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/22/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,AWESOME for a gluten free and vegan diet in an area where my options are all fried nonsense and heavy dairy. LOVED this place. Kind service too!
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/6/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,Small place on the lake in Doral.  Very fresh food with good service and decent prices.  They have many Vegan options  which I've tried and enjoyed very much.  I highly recommend for lunch in Doral.  Check in via Yelp for a free glass of wine.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",7/20/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"On a vegan kick lately and this casual high quality food concept is great. I love this trend of healthy food done right places to eat.,I had a pumpkin soup and a super foods salad. Really clean and fresh flavors with combinations I've never had before.,Price is fair considering ingredient quality."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/6/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"The place is a little crowded due to its small size, but just go outside and enjoy the beautiful deck they have in the back looking to a lake. The food is nice, I ordered a tuna salad, then we ordered smoothies, but I think that the salads neither any plate they offer is to eat in the restaurant. Everything is served in plastic containers. All the drinks came in plastic containers also, not to environmentally friendly in a restaurant where vegan people and green people come to eat. Other wise the experience was nice, a little bit slow the service to get your initial order but after that everything is fast."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,"We decided to visit Delirio Fresh on a Saturday late afternoon for a juice and a wrap. Their menu had many vegan and gluten free options to choose from and we were excited to discover a juice place that had so many food options. ,We ordered a Green Love Juice from the Green Juices section of the menu which has kale, spinach, cucumber, mint, ginger, and lime. We also ordered a Vegan Love Wrap and an herbal tea. While they were out of herbal tea I was pleasantly pleased that the waitress was able to provide me a small sample that was delicious! ,The wrap was good with a hearty amount of roasted vegetables and the portion size was generous. They offer gluten free wraps however, on this visit we chose the spinach wrap. ,The Green Love ""Juice"" was NOT a juice at all. Instead, what I received was a smoothie . Upon reviewing the menu again, the picture does look more like a smoothie than a juice. Furthermore, I missed the note that they're sweetened with Stevia .  Needless to say, it wasn't what I expected and I would not return with the expectation of having a juice here. ,The service was good, the menu variety is great, the ability to dine on their patio with a view of the water is nice. We'll likely be returning to try other menu items. Overall, I'd recommend giving this venue with plenty of vegan gluten free options a chance at least once. ,Happy Eats!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/30/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Had to go to Doral for school, and had to check out Delirio Fresh while I was there! I was completely surprised by the gorgeous outdoor water view. I first heard of the restaurant from Instagram, and I'm a huge healthy food fan, so I was excited to come and try this restaurant. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order, because all of the menu items looked delicious here. This doesn't normally happen to me as a vegetarian who likes flavorful and healthy food! I eventually settled on the Low Carb Vegan Bowl, which contained adashah (locally produced vegan based lentil protein), roasted veggies, mashed roasted pumpkin, avocado, chopped cilantro, sesame seeds and Delirio vegan dressing. I loved it, and found it reasonably priced. Also discovered when I was here that they have a location in downtown Miami, which is very close to me! It's called Delirio Fresh express (not exactly sure what makes it express), and I can't wait to try it! If you like plenty of creative healthy options at a reasonable price, and/or a nice setting to meet with friends, Delirio Fresh is your place!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/20/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Definitely a phenomenal option for people that like healthy and/or vegan food. This is a 5 star food and rockstar place with such a great lake view!!!! The only star that I can add there is the parking....... is few more business attached to their place so please be sure you wait in line for parking or park right in the front of the restaurant. If the bars beside or shops see you walking to the restaurant they are not friendly because is a very limited parking options. So sad because food and the place is AMAZING!!!'
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/28/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Great place for healthy alternatives. I'm vegan and had a few choices to pick from which is usually not the case. I went for the veggie sandwich without the cheese on gluten free bread and it was scrumptious! The water view in the back makes the place even more inviting! Will definitely be my go to place in Doral!
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",9/13/2015,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Hidden Gem! T&T is literally tucked away in a housing complex in Kendall. It has a hip Wynwood feel with affordable and delicious mexican fare. Vegan and Vegetarian options are available. Service is fantastic! It actually feels like the entire staff has stock in this place. They personally want you to have a wonderful experience. I predict another location opening in the near future.
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/12/2015,$$,3,Tacos & Tattoos,"Vegan customer here with a tip for management:,Tell the chef that the tofu and mushrooms need more seasoning, and that the portion sizes are ridiculously scanty. ,That being said, the service is phenomenal and the decor is super hip. ,Hip is a great word to describe this place."
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",7/30/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,Just recently went vegan and the tofu tacos here are BOMB ! They're my go to order and they're very accommodating to my dietary needs ! The restaurant itself is very nice the ambiance is somewhat underground and hipster. The staff is so friendly I can't really say enough nice things about their waiters and how friendly they are I will definitely be going back for more tofu tacos !
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",12/10/2016,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"Great music, amazing atmosphere, extensive menu, vegan and veggie friendly, can bring the kiddies and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more! Did I mention a lotta bang for your buck?"
"10720 SW 113th Pl, Miami, FL 33176",5/5/2018,$$,5,Tacos & Tattoos,"A cool little spot in Kendall.The food tastes fresh and you can tell there are experienced people or a chef is involved in the kitchen. There is a nice kick that I enjoy in almost everything, so beware if you are of a sensitive palate. Their fresh salsa is one of my absolute favorites. Used to visit more frequently before going Vegan, wish they had more plant based options, and or specific veggie items on their menu. Other than that, my entire family loves this place and it is a staple for our dinner celebrations."
