"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/6/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Just stopped by Della's Test Kitchen.  I'm not a vegan but I was attracted by the healthy menu.  I couldn't believe how tasty everything was.  The banana split dessert was incredible.  I will be back whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/18/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"OH EM GEEEE!!! This place is what every city needs! Not only is the food completely amazing (I recommend the green bowl, add tempeh and make sure to try the hot sauce on the side) but the staff is so authentic and kind and attentive and just so incredibly friendly in the most down to earth kinda way.... oh!! and make sure to get an almond butter cup! amaaaaazing! my daughter (who is 5) and I frequent Dellas probably 3 times a week and she just loves the roasted sweet potatoes and a side of avocado... its such a chill environment where she can run around and i don't have to worry about her disrupting other guests. the staff has gone as far as to play with her and show her around the place... its so refreshing to feel so comfortable out at such  trendy place! I am extremely picky about what I eat, as a nutritionist and vegan chef, i completely endorse Dellas Test Kitchen and the people behind it. from what i can tell, this is the best quality food one can find in Miami."
"2751 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2017,$$,3,SuViche - Wynwood,"This was my first time here, and I knew nothing about this place.  I was looking for seafood and found this close to where I was. We had sushi, ceviche, quinoa salad, ""Saltado veggie"" (great idea), and the ""Chaufa"" quinoa veggie (great idea).  I thought everything was decent, but not extraordinary.  It was takeout so sometimes that makes a difference.  I Loved the ""Saltado veggie"" it had the beef sauce and all that flavor without the beef.  The reason they are getting 3 stars is because while the ceviche seasoning was Good, the fish itself was a bit hard.  I don't know if it was over-""cooked"", old, or not fresh, so I was disappointed with this.  The service was Good because after I called to confirm the order, the server called me back to find-out if I was vegan, and said they could make the Saltado without the beef sauce, and the Chaufa without eggs."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/16/2014,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,The staff is really friendly and they have the best view in Doral . The selection is very healthy. The pizzas are well done and the salads are delicious . They serve almost everything in to go plastic bowls and cup. I love this place I just wish they were more Eco friendly and have more vegetarian/vegan options ( vegan cheese would be great)
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",12/21/2015,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Healthy and tasty food. Multiple choices for the vegan/healthy conscious oriented eater. ,Friendly service, nice location with a pretty view and they cater and deliver! ,Delivery is fast and accurate. ,Regular customer; will indeed go every day!   ,Will love for them to have a frequent  customer program... ,Great place! Love it!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",8/8/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Great spot! Healthy. Fresh food. Good view of the water. Would love to see more vegan options, but otherwise A+! :)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",3/2/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,So healthy and so delicious I cant stop eating. Vegan options and all natural and very fresh. Staff is very sweet and welcoming. Love this place.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/22/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've eaten here a couple of times and overall the food is hit or miss, and the service is a little on the slow side. Parking definitely sucks but it is one of the only places offering so many healthy choices especially for people who are vegan/vegetarian/gluten free. The avocado toast is good but there have been times I've gotten a soggy piece of bread with the smallest crumbles of goat cheese on top. Definitely give it a try, especially if you are trying to eat healthy or looking for vegan options! It's a little on the pricey side but everything in Miami is."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2017,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"I'm sure that vegans/gluten free people around the world as over joyed over this place! It is very creative and has a variety of items on the menu. However, if you are not vegan, gluten free, low calorie and are on vacation wanting to eat ALL of your calories- choose another pace. Lol. This was great- but this week I am not counting calories so I was an it underwhelmed that was my fault none of the restaurants. Most of the waiters speak Spanish but our waiter was nice explained the menu and we got a picture of mimosa. Oh and the outside view is great(part of the reason why I stayed even though the menu was looking a hit healthier than I anticipated)"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",2/10/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Delicious, great service and chill vibe. We had the avocado tuna salad and vegan colorful salad. Both very yummy. My kids had the pumpkin soup and adashah bowl, which they enjoyed. This was our first visit, but we will be back to try out more if the menu."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",7/20/2017,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"On a vegan kick lately and this casual high quality food concept is great. I love this trend of healthy food done right places to eat.,I had a pumpkin soup and a super foods salad. Really clean and fresh flavors with combinations I've never had before.,Price is fair considering ingredient quality."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/22/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,AWESOME for a gluten free and vegan diet in an area where my options are all fried nonsense and heavy dairy. LOVED this place. Kind service too!
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/6/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,Small place on the lake in Doral.  Very fresh food with good service and decent prices.  They have many Vegan options  which I've tried and enjoyed very much.  I highly recommend for lunch in Doral.  Check in via Yelp for a free glass of wine.
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/6/2018,$$,3,Delirio FreshCo,"The place is a little crowded due to its small size, but just go outside and enjoy the beautiful deck they have in the back looking to a lake. The food is nice, I ordered a tuna salad, then we ordered smoothies, but I think that the salads neither any plate they offer is to eat in the restaurant. Everything is served in plastic containers. All the drinks came in plastic containers also, not to environmentally friendly in a restaurant where vegan people and green people come to eat. Other wise the experience was nice, a little bit slow the service to get your initial order but after that everything is fast."
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",5/27/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,"We decided to visit Delirio Fresh on a Saturday late afternoon for a juice and a wrap. Their menu had many vegan and gluten free options to choose from and we were excited to discover a juice place that had so many food options. ,We ordered a Green Love Juice from the Green Juices section of the menu which has kale, spinach, cucumber, mint, ginger, and lime. We also ordered a Vegan Love Wrap and an herbal tea. While they were out of herbal tea I was pleasantly pleased that the waitress was able to provide me a small sample that was delicious! ,The wrap was good with a hearty amount of roasted vegetables and the portion size was generous. They offer gluten free wraps however, on this visit we chose the spinach wrap. ,The Green Love ""Juice"" was NOT a juice at all. Instead, what I received was a smoothie . Upon reviewing the menu again, the picture does look more like a smoothie than a juice. Furthermore, I missed the note that they're sweetened with Stevia .  Needless to say, it wasn't what I expected and I would not return with the expectation of having a juice here. ,The service was good, the menu variety is great, the ability to dine on their patio with a view of the water is nice. We'll likely be returning to try other menu items. Overall, I'd recommend giving this venue with plenty of vegan gluten free options a chance at least once. ,Happy Eats!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/30/2018,$$,5,Delirio FreshCo,"Had to go to Doral for school, and had to check out Delirio Fresh while I was there! I was completely surprised by the gorgeous outdoor water view. I first heard of the restaurant from Instagram, and I'm a huge healthy food fan, so I was excited to come and try this restaurant. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order, because all of the menu items looked delicious here. This doesn't normally happen to me as a vegetarian who likes flavorful and healthy food! I eventually settled on the Low Carb Vegan Bowl, which contained adashah (locally produced vegan based lentil protein), roasted veggies, mashed roasted pumpkin, avocado, chopped cilantro, sesame seeds and Delirio vegan dressing. I loved it, and found it reasonably priced. Also discovered when I was here that they have a location in downtown Miami, which is very close to me! It's called Delirio Fresh express (not exactly sure what makes it express), and I can't wait to try it! If you like plenty of creative healthy options at a reasonable price, and/or a nice setting to meet with friends, Delirio Fresh is your place!"
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",6/20/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Definitely a phenomenal option for people that like healthy and/or vegan food. This is a 5 star food and rockstar place with such a great lake view!!!! The only star that I can add there is the parking....... is few more business attached to their place so please be sure you wait in line for parking or park right in the front of the restaurant. If the bars beside or shops see you walking to the restaurant they are not friendly because is a very limited parking options. So sad because food and the place is AMAZING!!!'
"2475 NW 95th Ave, Miami, FL 33172",4/28/2018,$$,4,Delirio FreshCo,Great place for healthy alternatives. I'm vegan and had a few choices to pick from which is usually not the case. I went for the veggie sandwich without the cheese on gluten free bread and it was scrumptious! The water view in the back makes the place even more inviting! Will definitely be my go to place in Doral!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Amazing. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan and I am addicted to the food here. Great atmosphere, music and food"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/22/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"I love Della Bowls and am happy to finally see a well executed Vegan fast casual concept come to Florida! I selected the Mediterranean Bowl, and it was absolutely amazing. I was scared that because it was Vegan it wouldn't be filling, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The shakes are absolutely to die for. If you are in the Wynwood area you absolutely need to try Della!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/27/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Great place, vegan bowls, just what you need when your overloaded with processed foods!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/5/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I don't consider myself a vegan-y person, but I tried the Curry Bowl the other day when I was at the Yard and it was AMAZINGGGGG. Wasn't even that familiar with tempeh but it was really hearty and I left full and satisfied. Definitely going back."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/11/2016,$$,5,della bowls,This place sets the bar for what a plant-based restaurant experience should be! The menu is incredible and they offer cocktails unlike many other vegan spots. They have amazing events and specials as well. I highly recommend everyone check it out!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/23/2016,$$,5,della bowls,This place had amazing vegan bowls! They have some great combos to choose from or you could build your own! We went after yoga and the outdoor reggae band was playing creating a fun vibe. It was fun to be in a casual outdoor spot and enjoy a wit bite of amazing vegan food!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/26/2016,$$,5,della bowls,I went the other day with my family and was quite impressed. Although I do not eat lots of vegetarian/vegan foods I was surprised by how flavorful everything was. I got the Mediterranean bowl and LOVED IT! Everyone working was also very nice and helped navigate us through the menu. It is a bit pricy but definitely worth it!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"A friend did me right with his recommendation of Della Test Kitchen. Food was righteously fine, portions filling, price low, and service fast (It was a rainy Saturday night and not crowded, so I can't say how it is on a busy night.). After reading all the accolades for the Southwest Bowl, I knew my order before reading the menu. I loved it! My wife had the special bowl which she equally enjoyed and the smoothie we shared was tasty. We are not vegans, but enjoy good food and beverages and will return for sure. Some customers bought drinks at the outdoor bar in the open air Wynwood Yard, so if you want liquor with your dinner, it is available. On Saturday night there was a band playing on the stage across the plaza from Della inside the Yard which provided pleasant background music. Check it out."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/9/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"awesome healthy vegan food truck in my neighborhood ! the portion is more than what I expected, felt very full afterwards ;) plus the staff is very friendly !!! love love love !"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/18/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Della Bowls has amazingly fresh, vibrant, clean food that tastes as great as it makes you feel! They are conscious through and through, from ingredient selection to choice of disposable products used- and they even have a huge on site garden that they can pick from! Locally made iced tea, fresh teas, smoothies, and raw vegan desserts that taste as decedent as their guilt worthy counterparts. I will be back! Again, and again, and again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/13/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Filling food with tons of flavor and zero guilt! Della's customizable bowls are made with healthy ingredients that are irresistible to everyone, whether you are vegan or not.  I find the southwest & green bowls to be especially DELICIOUS and topped with mouth watering sauces that make me drool just thinking about them. The atmosphere at the wynwood yard is casual and inviting, so you can enjoy the outdoors while stuffing your face. This place is heaven! You won't be disappointed."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"The bowls are insanely good! Wow, I went there with my vegan friend and was at first intimidated but kinda just went for it and created my own bowl and it turned out so good and tasty. The staff is amazing and super helpful."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/25/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Was looking for something different...and boy did I find it! Awesome food and the staff is great, especially Asha! Outdoor seating, vegan food truck, free WiFi,  huge portions, and very tasty food!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Vegan, organic, healthy, build-your-own salad bowls. + desserts. laid-back environment. come, chill, and have some good food!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,By far one of my top favorite restaurants. If I didn't live 40 minutes away I would be here everyday. Their bowls are AMAZING and so filling. So full of flavor and deliciousness. Reasonable price considering the amount of food you get. Even if you aren't vegan you will fall in love. I usually stick with the green bowl and I crave it all the time!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/22/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"All vegan hub serving very tasty bowls, smoothies and desserts. I'm not a vegan and I still thought the food was delicious. It's quite on the pricier side: my meal was about $19 (I got an $11 bowl and an $8 smoothie). Not a bad meal at all, but I probably will avoid the eight dollar smoothie for it only being around 14oz."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/24/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Delicious and hearty vegan bowls. I love the red sauce! My only recommendation would be to offer a dessert with peanut butter :)
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/6/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my go to spot. The food is always fresh and the service is great. If you want fresh, raw, vegan food quickly this it the place to go."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The food is outstanding, best vegan place in the area. You can create your own bowl. I ordered the mediterranean and it was perfect, I loved it.  The only thing that I would say it wasn't good is that they allow dogs to be unleashed and pee where the tables are...I saw this big pup peeing twice right infront of me and the owner won't even say sorry...ew"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/3/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My vegan sister brought me here and as someone who LOVES meat, this was an insult at first but I do LOVE my sister so I didn't say anything and gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did! It was absolutely delicious!!! Not to mention the whole location has a wonderful atmosphere and zen vibe to it. I had a wonderful lunch and hope to be back real soon!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/30/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Loved this place such a good vegan spot in one of the cutest places I've been to in Miami the food and staff is great can't wait to go back !
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/25/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Love the concept. The food is vegan and non-processed. The bowl I got was fresh and tasty. I would add more sauce to the bowls. Make sure you order the biggest bowl, or you will likely go hungry when you leave. Looks like you can bring your dogs if they behave well."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/7/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Best meal I had during my entire trip to Miami. The greens are grown in a garden behind the restaurant . Everything tastes so fresh and it was very reasonably priced considering the quality of the service and the ingredients. Not to mention the location is SPECTACULAR. I would eat here every day if I could. If you're a vegan , 100% come here for your next meal in wynwood !!!!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,della bowls,Hands down one of the best vegan spots in Miami. We had two customized bowl along a green lemonade and almond butter joy. Great food awesome staff and impeccable service.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan food I've had in Miami. Most places offer very few vegetarian options. Della has many of healthy delicious options. Staff was friendly. Definitely going back.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I'm not vegan and this food is still amazing. I had the dalé bowl, which reminds me a lot of just a healthier, yummier version of a Mexican burrito bowl. The atmosphere of Wynwood yard is so quaint with lots of picnic tables and shade and there was constantly a line for this place over the others!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/16/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Very cool. The whole Wynwood yard concept is so much fun. It's a great spot to take your fur baby and chill on an open air cushiony bench in the garden, grab a drink at the stocked bar or grab a bite at Dellas. There are other rotating food trucks in the yard but Dellas is the anchor. The concept is healthy, vegan based on a build your own bowl kind of thing. Choose your base, your protein, your toppings and sauce. Not all that original here in Miami but the whole yard concept is just fun. Everything is outdoors. The bar and Dellas are,Covered but you're still outside so during the summer it's gonna be a bit hot and sticky. Downtown is always hotter than the beach. No wind, no air and it gets crowded there. The bowls are tasty, again not out of this world. The serving size if you get greens as your base, is a bit skimpy for the price. I got greens, chickpeas, lentils avocado and a walnut pesto. Good stuff but was hungry 15 minutes later and $15 lighter. ,It's fun to grab a healthy bite here, they have wifi, you can bring your laptop and your dog and chill. For me those are all big pluses nu today you're just going for a healthy bite, it's solid but not out of this world. ,You can make a whole afternoon of hanging in the yard though and that's fun. Plus you're in Wynwood and O cinema is right next,Door. And afternoon and stretch into the evening and the into the night."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,First time here. Best Vegan Food in Wynwood.. The food was amazing. I had the Southwest bowl with extra spice and a carrot ginger juice.. Will definitely be returning to della. Real soon..
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I am obsessed with this place. And I've only been here once. I'm actually still halfway through my Dalé  bowl. It doesn't matter if you're vegan or not, the food is incredible. The atmosphere in The Wynwood Yard is unmatched. Come check it out. You cannot be disappointed. If you don't want the bowls already listed, you can create your own! It's really all about you. ,Ah! Ok. I'm going to finish my amazing food."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/14/2016,$$,3,della bowls,"Service doesn't exist until you find it. We were told to sit at a table until we were ready to order and waited for close to an hour. After an hour we found a staff member to tell them we were ready to order and they had no idea we were ready to order. They told us after an hour to wait for someone else to find us to order. Have never seen a place so poorly run. Completely unacceptable and people that ordered after us received their food. I've been to the food trucks around Wynwood yard and have been treated with respect but have never been as insulted as well have here. Prep is easy seeing how it is vegan. Bush league presentation. ,Edit: 2 hours after this review....Owner came over to apologize for the service which was incredibly thoughtful and kind. Food finally arrived and was very tasty. We had a variety of the bowls which were delicious just as reviews had promised. Sadly I still had a bad taste in my mouth from a server telling me that the service was delayed because it was raining while those in the kitchen were visually on their phone and not partaking in food prep. I think this is likely an anomaly and hope that others realize this is not a common occurrence."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I came here as a newbie to Vegan food brought by my uncle and his wife who are vegans. I had my doubts of the vegan genre, but was pleasantly delighted (and IMPRESSED) by the food. I ordered the Caribbean bowl which was black coconut rice, adashah, sweet plaintains, kale, avocado, toasted coconut and yellow sauce. Let me tell you, I was impressed from the first bite.  The flavors paired perfectly together and I savored every bite. I will definitely be back next time I am in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/18/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I love this place! Great vegan food with incredible taste! I had a Green Bowl, simply delicious!! The service is quick and friendly. I'll become a regular to this place! Thanks Della"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is by far the best quick, casual, vegan restaurant in Miami. The dalé bowl is excellent and the almond butter cup is out of this world. Cannot wait for their new locations to open."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,They have a lot of interesting selections and the Dale bowl is my favorite.  The atmosphere is nice .  Everything is delicious.  This is one of my favorite vegan places.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/4/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Yummmmm! My friend recommended the Caribbean bowl and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not vegan but dishes like the Caribbean bowl and all of its flavor could help to sway me.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/14/2018,$$,4,della bowls,Creative and tasty vegan options.  I've been a vegetarian for decades and can't figure out why it often upsets my stomach a little bit... but I always go back after a few weeks.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I are not vegan but just fell in love with this place: delicious and healthy bowls, amazing location and super friendly service. We can't wait to come back!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/1/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is my favorite place to eat quick, healthy, and vegan! Every bowl I've had is delicious. My favorite is making my own so it's just what I like. Highly recommend this place"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Best vegan bowls in town for sure. The Caribbean bowl is amazing plus it has adashah which is delicious. The broccoli was sooooo good lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Just WOW. Vegan bowls that are soooo wholesome and filling and Delish!. Its a must for food lovers.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Very cool place. It's located the an area dedicated to food truck but they are stay in food trucks with tables and fans. The food was original and tasty as a vegetarian option. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I enjoyed it. I made my own bowl which was made up of black coconut rice, temps, avocado and plantains!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/30/2017,$$,5,della bowls,If I could give more stars I would!!!! Yummy! I love everything on the menu how easy is it to be vegan and eat so deliciously:-) the Caribbean bowl is my fav but they're all my favorite lol
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/16/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"This is a small, casual, unpretentious food truck/outdoor spot in wynwood that serves veggie bowls and smoothies. Everything is vegan. This is a great place to take your food purist friends ;) and anyone on a gluten free diet or lactose intolerant. You can design your own bowl which means you get to pick all the ingredients. ,I had the southwest bowl and the red corvette smoothie (see photos). Very tasty and fresh. I felt satisfied but not overly full.,I would give the food a 5, but the service and prices a 3 ($20 for my two items). So overall a 4. I would come here again, as overall I had a good experience and there are not a lot of places like this in Miami."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/17/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First time I have a bowl of 100% Vegan fare. I have to admit I was bummed they didn't have salmon or chicken and when I got my bowl I was like meh... until I started eating it! ,No need for animal protein in here. The Caribbean bowl has all I needed. Yes I'll take plantains over chicken :),Great spot and free wifi"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/13/2016,$$,4,della bowls,"Della is my food hero! Not only has she created a delicious menu of vegan options that are appealing even to a non-vegetarian like myself, but she's also the brainchild behind Wynwood Yard, the space that the truck is situated on, and many of the ingredients in the bowls come from the garden in the back. ,We went during the lunch hour, so it took a little while for the food to come out. I had the Southwest bowl - I liked that  some of the ingredients (sweet potatoes and tempeh) were served warm, and I was pleasantly surprised by how filling and satisfying the bowl was as a meal. It's definitely a great lunch option for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/8/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"Vegan bowls out of a food truck? My first thought when I heard of Delia's but I'm glad I pushed aside from that. My first time trying them was as delivery. Yummy put a bit more than I like to pay to eat at my desk. ,The Caribbean bowl was memorable enough for me to decide to go check them out in person. Well worth it. ,Inside the Wynwood Yard, this truck has a great location with proper seating and coverage from the sun. Complimentary spa water and quick service and I was sold. The location is fun and there is lots to see/observe. ,Even if you aren't vegan, or vegetarian even, I recommend coming here to carb load on yumminess."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/17/2015,$$,5,della bowls,"Let me start by saying this: I am not a vegan.,Della manages to take flavors, mash them together, and create some of the most tantalizing dishes I have ever had, all without an ounce of animal products. Her sauces are completely craveable, which, for vegan food, is a new sensation for me. But seriously, I will be sitting at work and my mouth will start watering just thinking about the Mediterranean bowl. ,I never feel dissatisfied eating Della bowls, which is a huge issue I have with vegan food, and one of the many reasons I am not a vegan. Her grains and artful preparation of vegetables leaves you feeling like you have all the energy you need to power your afternoon. ,Also if you actually can't convince your friends to eat vegan, there are 3 other food trucks right next to it on the Wynwood Yard that are all very good as well!,Get the Mediterranean bowl or the Southwest bowl. BOOM. Della bowls ROCK!"

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/17/2017,$$,4,della bowls,"The recipes and food looks like it's straight out of Grattitude Cafe in LA.  The original menu looked a rip off also.  The food is really good though, best vegan bowls around anyways.  Doesn't compare to the real Grattitude Cafe, the gang does a great job though.  Really sweet servers and generally chill atmosphere."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/28/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Thank you Della for an affordable vegan option in the Wynwood area! Possibly the only one... It's so appreciated! More more more more places like this in Miami, universe, please!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/7/2017,$$,5,della bowls,What a great place to eat if you want a little bit of everything. My wife wanted vegan so we went. Those things you do for Love.  Ordered a vegan bowl with her I have to say it was very good. It was a little pricey two bowls (which were pretty big) with a coconut water was about $40.00. Don't get me wrong it is really good food and the location is awesome. It Is an open air seating so you feel the air and where the veggies came from. It is good to eat something really healthy
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/21/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I recently went Vegan.  So as part of the new eating culture, a place like Della Test Kitchen is a must-try for anyone in Miami.  Located in the Wynwood Yard, Della serves up very high quality offerings.  The selection is impressive - most of the creations are plug-and-play with the ingredients.  You choose items from different categories and they make your creation.  For someone like me, I choose to go along with their pre-selected options, lest I take up too much time in line with indecision, annoying the rest of the people in line behind me.  The Dale Bowl is my favorite so far.  The food is fresh, delicious and filling.  You definitely don't leave hungry.  Even if you aren't vegan, the food is great!  Try it, you'll like it."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,Stunning... I love food. And those vegan bowls are amazing ... is clean and tasty. We love the wynwood yard atmosphere also
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Legitimately some of the best food I've ever had. I went there twice during a 3-day vacation in Miami. As a vegan, It was amazing to find a spot where everything on the menu was not only vegan, but also healthy and delicious.,Definitely recommend creating your own half-and-half bowl with black coconut rice as a base. Also try the adashah!,They were out of a few things when I went, so just be mindful of that."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,I'm not vegan and the adashah in the Caribbean bowl is amazing. I wish I knew its nutritional value. Will return !
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"I was in the area and needed to eat something quick. Thanks god for Yelp and this place did not disappoint. The menu is vegan based, and they do such an excellent job that it's bursting with flavors - for any hesitant people and the ones who love their meat ( I do! ). ,It's worth the visit if you want to try something new. The ambiance is quiet, granted I came during the day which is not when this area is usually very busy. ,So I was going to order the curry bowl, but they had a new one called Dalé (haha!). It was amazing. Anything with avocado has my name on it. They also have the ability to create your own bowl, and they also offer breakfast options, smoothies and desserts. ,Great job and if I find myself in the area again, I'll be back!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Awesome place. The food was really good, and it's a great place to sit if it's not too hot. We got the Caribbean bowl and Dale bowl. Both were good, but I liked the flavors in the latter best. Fresh, healthy, and vegan."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",10/30/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Few people could be more carnivorous than me. I love meat and I rarely have a meal without an animal in it. I'm also a foodie so just because I enjoy meat does not mean I don't enjoy plants too. I love fruits, veggies, and other non-animal organics. I ate here because my daughter's on a health kick and I figured why not. I can say that if I HAD to be a vegetarian, Della's would be my number one choice!! I had the brown rice, chick peas w sea salt, crispy broccoli w olive oil & garlic, yellow cashew curry, and avocado and loved everything about it. Totally vegan and very filling (took a good portion home). Would definitely eat there again!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,5,della bowls,created my bowl and it was AWESOMMMMME! Can't wait to go back and try more! I went with two of my non vegan friends and they loved Della just as much as I did!
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,One of my favorite vegan restaurants. Best vegan bowls in the city. The cauliflower & mushroom additions made to the menu are . Definitely must check this place out if you want to try vegan food in Miami.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/19/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This is the i-can't-believe-it's-vegan staple. The bowls here are beyond delicious (I actually crave them daily) and the ambiance is absolutely amazing! It's chill and earthy and organic. Plus everyone that works here is amazing! ,Recommendation: Definitely try their Caribbean Bowl! It's impossible not to love it. If you want a smoothie, they have an almond butter banana one that hits the spot multiple times. ,This is a must try spot in Miami. A place I'd call home. If you haven't been yet... are you really even living?!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",11/16/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Wow! That's the best way to describe this delicious vegan food! So tasty and healthy! I regret not ordering the larger bowl but was just enough to fulfill me. I had the Dale Bowl, so yummy!  I definitely recommend this to all my vegan friends  They also have UBEREATS to deliver! Will order again! Thanks guys!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",1/24/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Oh, it's all vegan? Yes it is, folks, and let me tell you: I didn't miss meat at all while eating from Della Test Kitchen. ,Their menu consists of bowls that already have the ingredients chosen for you. A friend of mine told me she usually opts for the green bowl that has avocado, broccoli and other types of green veg. I decided to make my own custom bowl with a base of black coconut rice, tempeh protein, sweet potato, yellow curry cashew sauce and toasted almonds. WOW! It was so delicious. I don't think I've ever felt so GOOD and FULL after eating a vegan dish. The portion size was fantastic; I could have saved some for later, but I had a friend help me eat it. Every component of the dish was cooked and spiced to perfection. ,Next time I'm in the Wynwood Yard, I will glady become vegan for a meal without any regrets."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/13/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"When I'm in Wynwood this is where I go for my vegan lunch. Really good, fairly fast service and a fun environment. It's outdoors so you can bring your fur kids :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",5/11/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"Yes yes yes! I was having lunch with a dairy-free friend and knew that Della Test Kitchen would be a good place for us to hit up since it's vegan. ,You can create your own bowl or opt for one of the existing combinations. Since I was a first timer, I decided to go with the Southwest bowl of greens, quinoa, tofu, sweet potatoes, tomato, sunflower seeds, avocado and red sauce. I also grabbed some of the hot pepper sauce on the counter to douse on top. It was spicy but went perfectly with this dish. Overall, my bowl was fresh, filling and flavorful. It was hard to finish it all but I couldn't leave one bite because it was that good! I also stole a bite of my friend's Curry bowl. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can find or make a bowl to suit you.,I can't wait to try more combos and would definitely have lunch here weekly if I could! Bowls are $9.50 with smoothies and other drinks costing between $7-$8. You order at the truck and then sit under the tent to wait for your food. It's an overall chill atmosphere and perfect for when it's nice outside.,There seemed to be some confusion among the staff when it came to food getting delivered, so I'd maybe suggest using a number system instead of the name calling. The girl taking our order also had to answer the phone a few times to worry about deliveries, which held the long line up a bit. The food gets to ya eventually and is worth the wait!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"This place serves amazing plant based bowls. The Mediterranean bowl is a party in your mouth. Everything fresh and so tasty and very decent prices. I hope this place stays up permanently. The area is so cool and cute, which makes it perfect for a nice late lunch dinner with friends. Wynwood yard yes for vegan options in Miami!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/20/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"In my dream life Della would be my personal chef.  Every Monday I wake up and swear that I will only eat healthy foods ever again. But by Tuesday I am usually craving only the delicious.  Della Bowls nails the healthy and the delicious.  I consider myself a pretty sophisticated cook, but I wasn't able to decipher what was in my bowl.  It was the most incredible mix of flavors and textures. This food is NOT only for the vegans of the world.  It is different and interesting.  I wish I could remember the name of what I had eaten, but based on what I could see on the menu, you can't go wrong.  All of the bowls are winners.  AND if you haven't been to the Wynwood Yard, run!  It's a great mix of food, drink, Music and coolness.  It's perfectly blended to create the setting for a fantastic Della Bowl."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/15/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"""Want to try this place? It's vegan"" my friend asked me, knowing full well that I love meat. However, it being a gorgeous night in Wynwood, live music playing in the background, and pretty stringed lights hung about,  I decided ""why not?"" and tried Della's kitchen and what can I say? Vegan tasted really good. It was filling and satisfying. ,Dellas is a create your own bowl place with options of base, vegetables, faux meats, and sauce. There are also options for bowls per Della's creation. I decided to go with the Caribbean bowl. It was a delicious generously portioned bowl of black coconut rice(so good), plantain, kale, avocado, curry sauce, and a faux meat (I can't recall the name of it). It was very filling and flavorful! There is bench seating right in front of the truck as well as a water station. I  thoroughly enjoyed my late night dinner at Dellas in Wynwood yard and I am looking forward to my next vegan meal there. :)"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",4/1/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Excellent vegan food in a super fun atmosphere.  Outside seating, walk-up ordering, and beautifully presented Buddha-bowl-style meals."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/18/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"I am absolutely IN LOVE! Have been wanting to try this forever and I'm so embarrassed that I didn't before because it's SO good! Think of a healthy vegan chipotle, the possibilities are endless when it comes to creating your perfect bowl. They even offer black coconut rice, which I have never seen before. And to super size your bowl for just a few extra bucks, you get to choose two of each category and basically have two meals! ,Of course once my friend, Danny, told me about this option, I had to super size it. Best decision ever cause my leftovers were like a golden midnight snack. So light and filling! The sauces are amazing, they drizzle plenty over your creation. I had the tempeh, and at first bite, you get this instant teriyaki type tofu taste. So delicious. And you MUST try their plaintains because they are the best ever! Usually plaintains are super oily from your typical Latin restaurants but not Della's! They're baked into ooey gooey sweetness pieces of perfection. ,This food truck is poppin inside a little area called Wynwood Yard. They're closed on mondays so be sure to come every other day as it's worth it! I was so pleased with every little thing in my bowl, I will come back over and over to try the entire menu! By the way, they only give you one slice of avocado so think about that before you ask for it lol"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",7/7/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"My wife and I happened upon della bowls at Wynwood Yard on our first night in Miami. It was recommended to us by the woman from the store right next to it and she did not steer us wrong. Absolutely the best vegan food we had on our trip! We had the dalé bowl (at the cashiers recommendation) and BYO with black coconut rice, adashah, kale, sweet potatoes, avocado and gold sauce. They were both insanely delicious! Both sauces were incredible and the adashah is so creative and versatile! Della makes food the way I cook at home, only better. My wife and I loved it...so so great!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/10/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"The idea behind most of Della Test Kitchen's offerings is simple: vegan proteins, veggies, and a sauce on a base of rice, quinoa, or greens in a bowl. The execution, however, is delicious. I've recommended it to people visiting Wynwood and have taken people there when I am in the area. The food is consistent and never disappoints. ,You can create your own bowl or select one of their recommended combinations. I've tried about 4 at this point, and they've all been good. There are multiple flavor profiles available, so there is bound to be something to suit your tastes. ,They also have some other things on the menu, like juices. I have had one of the juices and it was tasty.,The actual kitchen is a trailer in Wynwood yard. There is metered street parking right out front. The setting is quiet, and there are several picnic tables under a covered area. Because it is outside, it is pet friendly. The tables are decorated with succulents and the surrounding landscaping is lush enough that it feels a lot greener than most parts of typically industrial Wynwood.,Water pitchers and disposable cups are available, but because they use a refillable glass pitcher, you can also bring your own water bottle and fill it on your own if you're trying to minimize your waste."
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/6/2018,$$,5,della bowls,"Favorite vegan place in Miami!! I come all the way from Aventura just to get a bowl , hope to see it soon near Aventura"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/2/2016,$$,5,della bowls,"First off, I am not a vegan but I loved this place!! I was introduced to Della by a friend who has been a vegetarian for a while now and she recommended this while we were at Wynwood Yard. I'm so glad she did!! Whenever I think vegan, I've always thought of super healthy, dry, not very pleasant vegetables. This was the total opposite. Della has their signature mixed bowls or you can build your own. There are smoothies and desserts. They also have salads. The staff was very nice and was able to answer all our questions. ,I built my own half and half bowl, which is two of every category. I got quinoa and black coconut rice(forbidden rice) with tempeh, chickpeas, crispy broccoli, sweet potato, toasted almonds, pico de gallo on the side, and the yellow curry cashew sauce along with the green garlic here pesto sauce. This was packed with nutrition and full of flavor. Blew my mind. The chickpeas were soft, tempeh was tangy ginger tasting, the broccoli was perfect, the pico was refreshing. I loved the black rice. It's so fragrant and absorbs the sauces very well. Never knew I would crave a vegan rice and veggie bowl but if all vegan food tasted this good, I'd consider dropping meat!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/9/2018,$$,3,della bowls,"I'm gonna be honest - I'm vegan and I make nutri bowl/Buddha bowl often. I'm used to eating and working with the same ingredients as Della Test Kitchen serves. I had the make-your-own bowl and I was disappointed. For almost 12$ I got a bowl of rice, with sweet potato, tempeh and pico de Gallo (which tbh must have been dirt cheap to make). I just feel like it's overpriced for a vegan dish that doesn't require that much effort and when it's from a FOOD truck. Food truck food shouldn't be expensive lol! Anyways, the bowl made to order wasn't impressive and I won't be going back when I can go down the street to a REAL restaurant to get a fresh wrap or bowl for cheaper!"
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2017,$$,5,della bowls,"Miami needs more places like Dellas. Absolutely love their bowls. I typically build my own and mix and match ingredients. My best bowl combo: black coconut rice, tempeh, broccoli, avocado, and yellow sauce. The yellow sauce is a coconut curry cashew base; it's so good you'll want extra (only $1 - get the extra sauce, trust me). The bowl is the perfect size to fill you up, but you can always get a super-sized bowl when you're feeling extra hungry. Love the set up of the place in Wynwood Yard - great for a casual al fresco lunch. My one suggestion is for Dellas to get some stronger fans around the seating area; it gets super hot there in the summer. Besides that, keep it up Dellas. Love what you're bringing to the Miami vegan scene."

Food is delicious, one of my favorite bowls is the Caribbean. You may choose from a variety of options from beans, green veggies to quinoa and brown rice. ,I find the price inexpensive compared to other places I've been to within the area of Wynwood. It is worth trying at least once! ,Service wise, I cannot say a lot because it kinda of work like a fast food truck with the difference that this is healthy food. ,A great plus is that you can seat there and relax listening to live music from the Wynwood Yard! I love it!"

Seeing prior reviews, we decided to go down to Wynwood and give Della Bowls a try.,The food was made to order and the bowls were tasty. My wife decided to create her own bowl while I went with the Southwest bowl. We both enjoyed our meals and the servings were plentiful. ,The dessert options were very nice and the brownie sundae was awesome. ,The venue was very fun and the live music was great. ,We would definitely recommend this spot for a casual vegan meal with friends."

"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",3/1/2018,$$,3,della bowls,I am not sure if I really like this place yet or not. I ordered the Caribbean bowl on my the first time there.  The black coconut rice was way too hard. I devoured ot though because that's what a hangry person does.  I do have to admit and say the curry sauce was great! The bowls come in a large bowl... extraaaa large that is! There is ample space st the tables to sit amd enjoy your meal.  On my second time there.... I ordered the Dalé bowl. Meh.  It was alright.  Not the best. I think the flavor pairings for that bowl should be reviewed. It is a test kitchen. I came back again for a third time but did not order.  I sampled the tempeh. It was cold and dry. I wasn't really impressed. It is definitely not a bad option for a vegan meal considering the other options offered at Wynwood Yard.
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/27/2018,$$,5,della bowls,This place is delicious. There aren't many vegan options in Miami the land of pig lard in pretty much everything. To find a vegan place is always an exciting thing especially one with food as delicious as Della bowls. My only complaint is that they are in wynwood yard which is far and annoying to park. I wish they were more centric so I can go all the time :3! The bowls are top notch and filling! You can tell all the ingredients are top notch! I love their sauces and love that you can buy them no
"56 NW 29th St, Miami, FL 33127",2/21/2018,$$,4,della bowls,"ITS NOT JUST FOR VEGANS!,Della bowls - need I say more?  4 stars. You can't go wrong here.  This place finds a way to make vegan fill your belly - and at a good price.  I regularly snag pickup for lunch, and I'm always feeling refreshed and recharged for the rest of the day. ,Parking = easy, lots of it on the street and side streets,Ambiance = outdoor seating, live music often, bar nearby ,I would definitely recommend Della's to anyone trying to get into vegan food, or anyone who's hungry!"

You choose your base, veggies who h were all good make or sweet potatoes and my favorite ripe plantains, sauce and extra topping like avocado or pico de gallo pepitas or toasted coconut or almonds.,Almond butter joy smoothie was good too.   Healthy and delish is the best combo.  Out door seating on this beautiful day was a plus."

"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/28/2016,$$,3,Organic Bites,"Nice, small little restaurant on Biscayne, nice little patio area too, great vegan choices I had the quinoa and black bean salad, butternut squash soup and stuffed mushrooms. My girlfriend isn't vegan but she just wanted to have dinner and a few beers, only disappointment was when we arrived here they said they weren't allowed to sell us beer for some weird reason (we are well over 21), I ate my food for the sake of not getting up and leaving but I really picked this place over Choices down the street because they said they had beer, they gave me a cheap glass of white wine for the inconvenience but come on that's not the same as a good craft beer. Might try them again if they get their bar situation figured out."

I had a rare burger and my friend had the veggie burger both times.,We also shared the burrata (mouth watering) and zucchini carpaccio. The juices are made in house and had great zing. Would love a place like this back home and will definitely be back next time!"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",5/15/2015,$$,5,Organic Bites,"I work in the area so I have seen this location as several restaurants since the Metro days. Finally we have something that's just as good as Metro! As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see many vegetarian and vegan options, and they are delicious! The green seed salad is light on the dressing as it stays true to the flavor of fresh Ingredients. The Veggie Carpaccio was also a nice treat as I had never seen that before. Definitely a nice fresh appetizer perfect for our hit Miami weather. The owner/manager I dealt with was delightful which was a nice change from many other places in the area of this type. I'm really looking forward to coming here before work,To try their juices and coffees in the future!"

We decided to try Organic Bites and we were pleasantly surprised. ,Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some suggestions. She was a fun girl with a great spirit. I had the squash soup and the zucchini pasta, both of which were amazing. My friend had the chicken entrée with quinoa and scarfed it down!,The portion are perfect. We got the açai pudding for dessert and it was amazing as well. ,I will definitely come back as the atmosphere had a cool vibe and the staff was fun."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/9/2016,$$,5,Organic Bites,I have been here twice and both times food was delicious and the service was excellent. On my first visit I had the the steak with a side of seeet potatoe fries and vegan capraccio and it all tasted great. This time around I ordered the signature burger with no bun and it was mouth watering. The point of the review is that you can't really go wrong with anything you devide to order. I hope as the word spreads and they get busier they can remain consistent with food quality and service.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/4/2016,$$,4,Organic Bites,"Ordered out for a staff lunch and we were all very impressed. Suggested by a vegan coworker, this place had more options than one would assume. I had the Reuben and added grilled onions. By far one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The atmosphere of this place is definitely a weekend favorite. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would for sure recommend this place to anyone looking for some different good eats."
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/10/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,Burger was good and the ambiance was chill mainly outside. I did hate the fact there's no regular fries just sweet potato fries which I don't like. I know I'm prolly the only person earth that doesn't eat sweet potato fries but I just cannot get into them. Besides that there's nothing special about this place. Supposedly it serves organic foods. It is a great place for vegans because my friends bean vegan burger tasted actually better than my beef burger.
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/23/2018,$$,3,Organic Bites,"I heard about this place from a good friend of mine. She mentioned that the food was amazing. With much anticipation I visited the restaurant, it was cute and all however, there weren't many protein alternative options for vegans like myself.  They did have a vvegan burger which came with goat cheese so that wasn't very helpful. The service was aaaaaah just ok. A bit of a wait, yet there weren't many people in the restaurant. I asked for a macha tea with almond milk and I got just that a tall cup of warm milk with a teabag floating in it. That part still makes me giggle when I think of it. Long story short. I won't be putting this place on my list is frequently visited restaurants"
"7010 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/22/2018,$$,5,Organic Bites,"This place is really good and everything on the menu looks awesome! What we did try was amazing! Everything tastes fresh, and the service is excellent. (They don't have many gluten free options which is a bummer, and not too many vegan options either.) Hopefully they get some Kombucha because that would be nice with the meal (instead of lemonade or soda) I would come back again to try more dishes and I would definitely recommend for a nice breakfast or lunch!"
"2727 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/1/2014,$$,4,R House Wynwood,"The perfect date restaurant, no doubt about it. R House its a combination of Art Gallery and restaurant, in the heart of Artsy Wynwood. Their specialty is the Brazilian dish, ""moqueca"", that my date truly enjoyed;  since I'm vegan, I had the Falafel salad with no feta cheese, and I must say it was really good, full of fresh flavors. To top it all off, had the super healthy, super Eco-friendly Cilantro Martini that made me feel as naughty as Mother Earth with all their recent shaky earthquakes.,The reason for the 4 stars?? Our server was slightly annoying, interrupting our conversation every 2 minutes. Not cool. When you see people enjoying themselves, back off, my friend!"

The details, the attention, the food, the service.. I cannot express how grateful I feel for such a delightful experience. Im Vegan and there is great Vegan & Vegetarian options, my guests also had fish & meat & everybody loved the food. The drinks were delicious as well. Thank so much! It's really refreshing to find a place like this in Miami!!!"
"335 S Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33131",12/25/2016,$$$$,4,Il Gabbiano,"Food: Fresh ingredients, lovely presentation, and huge portions make for great food at Il Gabbiano. Vegans have plenty of options and the chefs gladly accommodate your requests. I had a shell pasta with broccolini. It was extremely flavorful and the pasta was cooked to perfection - not too soft. Solid wine selection, too. The non-vegans with me loved the seafood and steaks. The sauces are rich. ,Service: Great! Super helpful and attentive. Very pleasant.,Ambiance: Wonderful views of the port from the deck/balcony. Interesting music choice, probably not fitting with the overall ambiance: pop hits of 80s and 90s."
"9519 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33156",2/5/2016,$$,5,Shaddai Fine Lebanese Cuisine,"The best Lebanese cuisine in Miami. Possibly the best outside of Lebanon! Everything we ate was seasoned perfectly and very very flavorful. Try the mjaddarah as an appetizer. Really special treat! If you are a vegetarian or vegan, they have so many great options. It is a family owned, local business. The daughter of the chef waited on us and was so helpful! She had great recommendations. Happy we found this gem! Highly recommended it to anyone who likes middle eastern cuisine, or anyone looking for great food in Miami."
"737 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/7/2018,$,5,The Green Chicken,"Hellooooooo deliciousness!!!!! This new gem is located on the first floor of the 109 Towers. If you're looking for a healthy meal this is definitely the perfect go-to spot! I recommend the jerk chicken and the peanut punch smoothie  it taste like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ! This spot offers wraps, bowls, quesadillas, and smoothies....chicken, steak & VEGAN options. ,The curry sauce is a MUST! ,This area was in desperate need of a healthy, and affordable spot...A must try, you won't be disappointed"
"737 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/15/2018,$,5,The Green Chicken,"Great vegan and healthy options. The staff is very friendly and always looking forward to please their customers. The tofu was delicious, and after lunch my mom and I had an iced soy milk latte and a passion fruit smoothie that were just perfect. Will come back."
"737 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",7/25/2018,$,5,The Green Chicken,"Their food is so wonderful. People are really missing out on their smoothies! I love their plant-based options like veggies, tofu, and vegan protein. Their staff is also the most amazing people with great customer service :)"
"7418 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",6/28/2015,$$,3,Ms Cheezious,"Grilled (cheese) sandwiches and fries are the only thing worth trying here. All other sides fall short and I wouldn't recommend ordering. Especially the Mac and cheese and vegan options - pretty bad. ,However if you want a great grilled cheese and fries this is the place!"
"7418 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",3/6/2017,$$,5,Ms Cheezious,"Some of the best comfort food in Miami! As someone who loves cheese but has sworn off dairy, I appreciate their vegan cheese options. They also have gluten free options for all their sandwiches too. Try the short rib! It's my favorite."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/31/2018,$$,3,Le Pain Quotidien,They need to work on the availability of the menu items. Being vegan it's hard to make this a go to because they are quite often out of the vegan choices. Also the hours of operation are not early enough for a bakery or late enough for a restaurant....figure yourselves out and adjust your hours accordingly!
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/8/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"The food at this restaurant is amazing. Even vegetarian and vegan eaters will be in heaven here. I've tried soup, rice, and noodle dishes that are all delicious. If you like spicy the kimchi soup is a must try. If you haven't been to this restaurant yet please don't wait..... its so much tastier than anything they sell at 1800 Lucky and the service is 1 million times better."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",12/1/2017,$$,5,Le Pain Quotidien,"SO HAPPY this is here!! I've been a NYC fan for a decade, and having it here is just a blessing from the french-cafe lords. They have vegan coconut yogurt which makes my dietitian heart sing, and an array of other plant-based options (the lentil soup was divine - love the little tiny French lentil variety) and combined with the zucchini noodle pad thai was a sumptuous lunch. I've also had the cheese plate, and again, as a dietitian, that makes me one happy chick - since I studied abroad in France and had this every day for lunch (plenty of protein and relax - cheese is good for you). The service is divine and friendly and the price is perfect. I'M SO IN LOVE."
"2550 S Bayshore Dr, Miami, FL 33133",1/29/2017,$$,5,Monty’s Coconut Grove,"Love Monty's!!! I visited here for my boyfriend's birthday with friends, and we had a great time. I've also been here many times in the past with family or friends. Although there aren't very many vegan options, that's expected because this restaurant is known for their incredible seafood. ,Aside from good food, this place is also known for their frozen and on the rocks drinks. If you're looking for that piña colada Key West beach vibe, this is the place. The setup and ambiance of the restaurant really gives off a laid back, fun vacation getaway tone. They sometimes have live music and performances, especially on weekends. Also, their happy hour specials are hard to beat, with drinks being nearly half off Monday-Friday. ,The view of the bay is beautiful. When we went, we got seated right next to the water. At night, it really gives off a romantic yet fun allure, so it's a great place to come on a date or with friends. With the lights reflecting off the water, and the occasional fireworks set off by nearby boat parties, you will have a memorable experience every time you visit. ,This place seems kid friendly enough-during the daytime. I wouldn't recommend bringing your child to a bar at peak hours of the night, only because it becomes more of an adult atmosphere by that point. However, I'm sure it's fine if you bring your kids because they will enjoy the food and surrounding areas to run and play, since it's an open and outdoor restaurant and bar. There's a sidewalk path along the dock, so it's also nice to walk along after your meal and enjoy the view of the bay. You can also see the different boats docked, which is always fun. ,Parking is a pain. If you've never been here, it might be difficult to find the parking lot, because it's located a bit far from the restaurant and is in a dark area. So it's a little spooky if you're alone at night. Keep that in mind and be safe. I don't recall if parking is free or not in the Monty's lot, but spots do fill up regardless so it's wise to bring parking money, incase you need to park on the streets. ,Overall great experience, definitely a gem of Coconut Grove."
"3444 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",8/30/2017,$,5,The Bookstore and Kitchen,"I lost my E-card tonight at The Bookstore and it was amazing. Imagine introducing marshmallow fluff to a 10 year with overbearing vegan parents. That reaction =my face.,I was on campus for a work event with full intentions of going to Versailles on the way home. Waiting for the event to end, ATT said I used all,My data this month, sooooo YOLO and I opened Yelp, fat fingered my way to events and found this.,First- thank you to the CM for letting me crash. ,This was actually overwhelming initially. Walk into a room with 50 strangers, bound together by the fact we all have enough free time (and lack of face to face convos) that we post on the internet. I kid, I kid. ,This is actually a bookstore, so a huge thank you to the owner for keeping this alive. Hopefully you'll add VHS movie nights soon? ,We're given a menu for the evenings tastings, paired with white and red. Im sure the actual wine is described, but I'm not that refined, nor attempt to be. ,5 separate sharing courses:,Arugula salad with figs and fancy ham (autocorrect and I don't know how to spell prochut),Smoked Fish dip,A tomatos and herbs on bread ,Chilled shrimp sandwich ,FRENCH TOAST ,100% executed perfectly. ,I hope I'm not the only one to think this, but kudos to the new chef for planning this meal they way she did. Every dish was designed to be simple, bold flavor and texture, and fool proof. ,What I mean by fool proof is that every dish was technically meant to be served at room temp, or slightly chilled, French toast not included. The menu is designed to allow refires if needed hat won't hold the kitchen up...... a moot point considering she killed it. ,Lastly, I can finally feel vindicated in the ever lasting argument with my gf that French toast is actually a dessert  and not breakfast. ,I'm not in MIA often but very much looking forward to coming back"
"3444 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/5/2018,$,5,The Bookstore and Kitchen,"Beautiful bookstore, excellent staff, coffee and service. Vegan tip:. Try their vegan empanadas."
"28 NE 29th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/25/2017,$$,3,Morgan’s Restaurant,"Walking in the place looked really nice and cool. Did not appreciate having to wait in a line to be seated. Then it took a while for the server to even acknowledge that we were here and the service was good not great. My girlfriend really enjoyed the raspberry French toast, giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. My vegan burger was not great it was fine. Knowing that it is hard for most places to accommodate vegans is hard, but either way not many options to choose from and it was more mediocre than anything."
"3425 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/12/2018,$$,5,Le Pain Quotidien,One of my favorite places in all of Miami to eat!!! Great vegan and non vegan choices. I chose vegan myself. Love it!!!
"1051 NW 14th St, Miami, FL 33136",10/4/2016,$,5,Manger Creole,I visited this restaurant after a coworker recommended it to me. The food was great and was ready to order they also offer vegan dishes which I thought was great. I'd recommend this place to anyone who likes Haitian food.
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/11/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,"This is the type of food that was missing in Midtown/Wynwood and I'm glad they have vegetarian and vegan options. I had the veggie dumplings, stir fry tofu and the japchae with veggies. All was excellent and tasty, will come back soon for the fried rice!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/12/2016,$$,5,grown,"Wow! Can't even begin to explain how special this place is. From the food, the vibe, and especially the owner, Shannon! We had the vegan & gluten free soup which was incredible!!! Also sampled the salmon burger & eggplant sandwiches which I'm craving already. They have many community events and specials so check out the instagram page. (That's how I found out about free yoga & yummy bites afterwards). The owner is incredible. Her mission is so clear and that is to spread the word about an organic lifestyle and cater to those who believe so deeply in it like she does. She literally went around from to table to table to speak to guests. If you aren't aware, she is Ray Allen's wife. The reason I bring that up is because she doesn't have to be running this restaurant, she has money. She does it because she truly has a passion and cares! She orders everything from the restaurant herself and makes sure it is locally sourced and organic! From the fruits, veggies, & meats! She also stores EVERYTHING in BPA free containers. Why would she do that? It is triple the amount of money and nobody will ever know. Again, because she CARES! What a beautiful lady , inside & out! Can't wait to go back (especially to try breakfast). By the way, GROWN caters to EVERYONE! Vegans, gluten intolerant, meat lovers...oh and wine lovers too! Check them out, you won't regret. P.S: For those complaining about price.. organic food (especially how they order) is pricey, you will not find that anywhere! Your body is a temple, take care of it! No amount of money can replace sickness or disease. There is no price on good health."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/17/2016,$$,4,grown,Excellent food overall. Had the free range chicken wrap Capri Salad Style along with a vegan minestrone soup. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion for a fast food type of place.
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fuchai,"This place is small, intimate and offers Chinese and Korean food, with an emphasis on Korean. Fuchai is ideal for that moment when your taste buds cry out for intense and varied flavors. The portions are plentiful, they offer soups, salads and options for vegetarians and vegans. During our visit we saw many people who asked for food to take home."
"2506 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/16/2018,$$,5,Fuchai,Great little mom n pop place - the food is amazing (see pictures attached). Is very small place so small groups (2-6) works best. They have some vegan vegetarian options. Not much of it but delicious
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",5/25/2016,$$,4,grown,"A nice fast food restaurant. The employees were very friendly. They greeted each customer immediately at the door. The sitting area was very cute. The tables were a little small but I think that for a fast food restaurant it is not a big issue. We ordered two smoothies, a salad with Havana vibe and salmon, and a wrap with salmon. The food came with soups - Chicken tortilla and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup. The food was very good. All ingredients were fresh and tasted delicious. The only thing that surprised me was the bill. The food is a little bit too pricey for a fast food restaurant. The total bill was $58! But I guess they have to pay the Pinecrest's rent!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/30/2016,$$,5,grown,"Only been open a month and is doing very well! Everything on the menu is incredibly fresh , the ambiance is adorably cute, and there is open-air (covered) seating. I had the Grown Simple Greens wrap and Gluten Free Vegan Minestrone soup which were delicious. The silverware and plates are made of renewable materials and the juices are amazing. Try the Love Greens!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",4/4/2017,$$,5,grown,"Food that tastes great and makes you feel good ordering. Everything is USDA organic. This is also an excellent place for vegetarians, vegans, people with dietary restrictions, allergies, etc. ,The salmon was fine dining quality on a paper plate. I recommend trying the Mexican corn. ,Since it is was our first time, the manager, Chris, walked us through the menu and gave us samples to try. Bonus points for excellent service. ,As others have mentioned, this place is more expensive than other counter service restaurants, but I would argue the food quality and taste is MUCH better. We enjoyed dinner so much, we splurged for dessert (something we rarely do). Excellent too!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",1/4/2017,$$,4,grown,"I enjoyed my visit here when I came early on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend. The food was tasty enough, and there were plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. The reason why I give this restaurant four stars instead of five is because it was extremely pricey for the portion sizes we were getting. We both left feeling hungry after spending $xx amount on our breakfasts. I wish they had bigger portion sizes. Also, it gets very crowded on weekends, mainly with local families coming after a soccer match, etc."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",3/30/2017,$$,5,grown,"I loved this restaurant!!  I had the wild salmon on a gluten free wrap with the simple greens, soup was included and I had the chicken and mushroom. My soup was very tasty and my wrap was scrumptious!  I was only able to have half of my wrap because it's quite large so next time I'll order an extra soup and share the wrap. I didn't have dessert but on my way out saw they had vegan and gluten free desserts which I will try next time. Can't wait to visit them again. ,Ps- I was very impressed that they had Rudi's gluten free bread, wild salmon and free range chicken. I wish I would've had access to a ""fast food restaurant"" like this when my kids were small. I'll definitely be taking my grandkids!"
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",10/16/2017,$$,5,grown,Stopped in for lunch for the first time.  Simply amazed! The owner Shannon was very wonderful and informative on the healthy styles of eating. We were offered a complimentary dessert that was vegan delicious.
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",6/5/2017,$$,3,grown,"I heard a lot of hype coming into this place, and while the food is fine, it's nothing all that outstanding.  I came for breakfast, and it seems like a great deal that you can get home fries, bacon, and fruit for $5, until you see that it's less food than you would've gotten for the same price at IHOP.  For all the gluten-free, local-source, vegan-friendly, blah, blah, blah, you see, the food was pretty bland and basic.  I'm not saying the food isn't good.  I'm just saying that their cage-free, macrobiotic, whatever, whatever eggs taste the same as what I have in my fridge from Publix.  Now, I'm not going to lie, their juices and smoothies are really good, but they set you back about $10.  If paying $10 for a great smoothie is something that wouldn't bother you, then grown is right up your alley."
"8211 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33143",7/1/2018,$$,3,grown,"So, this place is delicious and healthy and yes everything tastes extremely fresh and natural however ridiculously overpriced. TWO wraps and a cookie came out to $42!!! What?! Kind of insane. I was shocked at how expensive it was. I tried the Mediterranean wrap and the Havana wrap both with chicken- they were delicious I can't deny that. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was also amazing- very flavorful and yummy. Decorated very cute. I wish there were more places like this- they even have a drive thru. My only complain was the price and it's a shame but I wouldn't return because of it."
"1700 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33129",2/14/2016,$,5,Le Marché Cafe,"This place is amazing! The ambience is very laid back and the staff is so friendly, they make you feel welcomed. They have so many different options suitable for all diets: gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian and meat lovers. The coffee is awesome and they have different milk alternatives for those who prefer. The croissants are scrumptious and the soups are to die for. I would definitely recommend this place!"
"350 NW 8th Ave, Miami, FL 33128",11/26/2017,$$,4,Miami River Cafe,"Vegetarian and Vegan options found here ,Homemade tortillas always steal my heart, and theirs are on point. Delicious!,Homemade salsas and beans. Elotes (street fair corn on the cob) are a must and Margaritas were also so good at only $4 bucks. Chill atmosphere with Latin music playing, which is always a plus, in my opinion ;). Thumbs up and be back, for sure!"
"8376 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33155",6/20/2013,$$,4,Kon Chau Restaurant,"Kon Chau dim sum on a lazy afternoon. This place is understated. Heavy traffic at weekend brunch time, but otherwise peaceful. The food is fast, delicious, and inexpensive. A vegetarian (not vegan) and a meat eater will both leave satisfied. The dining area is simple and unpretentious, unlike many Miami 'pan-Asian cuisine' type places. Dreamy dreamy dim sum is the real deal. ,...and my little brother was digging on the smooth sounds of the 70's."
"7378 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/1/2016,$$,5,Bangkok City Thai & Seafood Restaurant,"Bangkok City has been recommended to me by COUNTLESS people since I moved to the area about a month ago. I thought to myself, not everyone can be wrong about this place so I'll give it a try, even though I already have my usual Thai restaurant. I started with the basics - tom-coconut soup, pad thai, and red curry tofu, ALL were out of this world. The curry dishes in particular really blew me away. It's not just the cuisine here that's incredible, but the staff is so welcoming and nice that it almost makes me want to stay and eat there when I'm picking up a to-go order! As a vegan, I now eat here at least three times a week since I can get veggies and tofu made in so many different ways. Bangkok City is now my go-to spot for Thai or sushi."

The staff was attentive,courteous and more than helpful. The owners were more  accommodating for me being that I'm vegan and created a masterpiece that tasted just as good as it looked.,The owners are so hospitable and really care about your experience at their restaurant and go above and beyond to help even create something that works with your diet. They also recommended an antique store and it was a double win for me. It had such a vast collection of all types of antiques and they were actually very well priced and realistically . The lady who owns it was more than friendly as well.,All in couldn't have made a better choice but to eat here. The decor inside is so well embellished with accenting pieces that all work beautifully  together to create a place that almost feels like you aren't in Florida, anymore .  Everything was thought out from when you first walk in to even the ornate tableware  itself .,I really Loved my whole Hialeah experience !"
"9971 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",2/29/2016,$,4,The Habit Burger Grill,"The customer service was great, the cashier was very informative about how my food was prepared, acknowledging my vegan preferences. The food was ok to good. Could be made a little better. It did fall apart a little, but that's what I get for ordering it to go. Nice scenery as they try to give it a very LA beach kind of vibe. Not being a picky eater or customer, I was overall satisfied. Can't give a final judgment on this restaurant, considering I only tried it once. Would go back here to try other foods."
"4141 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2014,$$$,5,MC Kitchen,"Depending on who you ask, many people would say that MC Kitchen is either the best or second best ""foodie"" restaurant in all of Miami, which means you will need a reservation even if the dining room doesn't look full. You don't come to a place like this only to miss out by being vegan, but it's vegetarian-friendly if you eat cheese.,We split 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 side dish between 2 people. We started with the Cobia Crudo which was flavorful but not very much food, and a dish we honestly could have done without. If you want something more substantial, the Black Mission Fig Pizetta was amazing, and can be made vegetarian by asking them to leave out the prosciutto.,The kale risotto came alongside the entree and was good, but paled in comparison to the real star of the meal, the Roasted Pear and Cheese Fiocchi. It's hard to describe how these delicate pockets of pasta and stuffing just satisfies down to the soul! It's creamy but thick, sweet but savory, solid but melts in your mouth, yet somehow still greater than the sum of all it's adjectives! Their truffles are imported from Italy, and the taste was very evident in the Fiocchi.,Because our meal had no meat to pair with wine, we asked the waiter to recommend a nice dessert wine and he supplied an irresistibly sweet but deceptively strong $60 Barefoot Moscato, which put the cherry (or grape) on top of a truly amazing meal."

But heads up, you can't add tip to your receipt once the meal arrives, you have to add it in advance. The deliverer was also extremely nice, and I owe him a few more bucks!"

You would think I wouldn't give them a great review since they ran out of the Vegan burger I came there for but instead Natalie took control of the situation turning lemons into lemonade. Her customer service was off the chain. She apologized and gave me her  direct number to call her ahead to make sure they had it for my next visit there. A week later I did as she said, she remembered me and even had my order ready before I got there. Oh and I can't forget to give the chefs in the kitchen kudos for their charm,Natalie is what's missing in Miami...damn good customer service! I have my own food company and she is what I look for in building a great business!!!"

What's the recipe because I need to replicate it. It was juicy, creamy and freaking amazing. It did take some time to make but who cares when it's made fresh. I will try again on a cheat day. I've tried different vegan Mac & cheese and this is the Mecca of Mac n cheese. ,My friend had the jerk chicken Mac & cheese and finished the entire thing. Its a little on the pricier side but it's so worth it. ,Please do yourself a favor and visit this place. ,I have to try the vegan burger next time..."

"3197 Commodore Plz, Miami, FL 33133",9/13/2016,$$,3,Farinelli 1937,"I visited this spot with some coworkers.  My first impression was that it smelled great walking in !  I liked the little patio spot and thought that would be a great spot to sit and have some drinks at happy hour and people watch.  We were there for lunch though and it was muggy out so we sat inside.  There are several vegan and vegetarian pizzas.  We were brought bread but only when we had asked for it .  My coworker on a previously visit said it was automatically brought to them. Then napoletana has no cheese , just skip the anchovies .  The verdura miste is oven roasted veggies with focaccia bread is vegan as long as you skip the goat cheese on the focaccia and skip the yogurt sauce.  I had this and although it was a full plate , it didn't leave me feeling full.  It would have been nice with a side of pasta or some other grain.  My coworkers ordered pizza and calzones and they were fairly happy with their plates.  Maybe when I go back for happy hour I will be able to give 4 stars :)"
"650 NW 71st St, Miami, FL 33150",1/27/2017,$,5,Naomi’s Garden Restaurant & Lounge,"The food here is mind blowing!! It's so authentic, rich, and satisfying. The legume dish was my favorite before I started eating a strict vegetarian diet, but upon my recent visit I realized they have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. Everything here is good. The Mac and cheese has a spicy kick to it and their corn meal is hearty and filling. The passion fruit juice is a compliment to the spicy flavors in a lot of their dishes, and pickled salad. Everything here is fresh and portions are huge. This place is a GEM if I could give it more stars I would!!!"
"650 NW 71st St, Miami, FL 33150",12/29/2017,$,5,Naomi’s Garden Restaurant & Lounge,"Ordered vegan dishes via delivery: Tofu Stroganoff, Legume (Vegan), Spinach and Lima Beans, 2 with rice and peas, 1 with bulgar, all with steamed vegetables.,All excellent. The legume with bulgar was particularly tasty."
"650 NW 71st St, Miami, FL 33150",9/5/2017,$,5,Naomi’s Garden Restaurant & Lounge,The lambi was awesome! Great portions and tasty spicy picklese! They also have vegan dishes. Order at the window and take to go or i believe they might have garden seating as well. Will definitely go back!
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",2/13/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Super authentic, absolutely loved the ramen. Moshi dessert was also really tasty. I can't wait to come back and try more off their menu. They're very kind and accommodating for any dietary restrictions like vegan or vegetarian. Would definitely suggest checking this place out. Their inside a Plaza so there's tons of parking."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/18/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I absolutely love this spot! The food is so yummy and delicious. I enjoy coming here because it has a great ambiance!

"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",9/29/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,I go to this place all the time because of its location. Love their vegan spicy ramen and their Yaki Udon. Definitely a vegetarian friendly place with options for everyone. You can't leave here without having their Zombie Plant dessert. It's sooooo good. I love watching it transform and then devouring it moments later. Can't wait to try their other desserts. Would love to see some new vegan/vegetarian options on the menu in terms of entrees but I love what they have right now so no complaints.
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",11/10/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I'm extremely pleased with the food here very delicious, I ordered the Thai fried rice (vegan style) and my sister ordered the spicy ramen soup, we weren't familiar with the menu so the person taking our order took time to explain it to us & accommodate to my vegan diet! Amazing service and awesome food! :)"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",3/16/2017,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Place is a little expensive but worth it on a treat yourself kind of day, I love the vegan gyoza and the taro bubble tea, the bubble tea was especially sweet and so good! I've been there 3 times and the only thing I didn't like was their vegan sandwhich, the bread was stale and the sauce didn't really taste that good, but other than that, I fully recommend their desserts, their tea, gyoza, soup etc etc"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/10/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"Was bored of the usual coffee places nearby when I found this little cafe. Had their spicy Raman and vegan gyoza. The spicy Raman was really good and the gyoza was ok.. I wish they introduce chicken gyoza also. I had their coffee frappe and my friend had the green tea frappe. ,Too full to try the raindrop cake but I m coming back soon to have it. ,Yes! They have the raindrop cake!!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",3/29/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Went here for a little lunch date with my best friend. Sadly, they were out of vegan gyoza but I got the tofu sampler instead. I love tofu, and that dish wasn't huge but it was so yummy and it filled me up, especially with the large tea I ordered. I can't wait to go back and try more of their vegan options!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/1/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"On my top 5 of best hole in the wall Asian restaurants in Miami. Delicious options for everyone including vegan or vegetarian. Tastes very authentic and leans towards Korean flavors and inspirations. Dessert, dinner, or just coffee are all wonderful choices. I've been numerous times but my favorite dish is the Spicy Ramen."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",11/25/2016,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"If you're vegan and love Thai food, this is your place. The menu is plentiful and the food is delicious. Best of all, the staff is so very pleasant and accommodating to changes. If you have a dietary restriction, I highly recommend."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/18/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"107 Coffee & Desserts is my favorite place right now, either to have some lunch with a friend or to do my school work. The environment is very enjoyable, staff is nice and friendly, and food is amazing . I come here at least twice a week. Vegans and Vegetarians, I highly recommend this place. It's always a struggle to us finding places to eat, but you will feel appreciated here."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",12/18/2016,$$,4,107 Taste 味,"I'd never expect to find this place in the shopping center where it is. The staff is so friendly (Asian) that they gladly made Cuban coffee for a local woman who came in yelling asking if they had any. I've had the tofu pad Thai, spicy ramen and veggie gyozas and all are pretty great. Not the best pad Thai I've had but definitely the best tofu I've ever had. Most of the menu options can be prepared vegan or vegetarian. They'll assume you'll want a fork, so extra points if you ask for chopsticks instead."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/15/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is one of my faves! It's quaint with modern yet rustic decor. The menu is written on a huge chalkboard and ordering is done at the counter. The food is delicious, I've been there a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Korean rice bowl, the portion is large and the flavors are on point. Surprisingly the desserts are also good. The strawberry crepe is amazing! Light & fluffy and not too sweet. They also have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus. Service is friendly and there is plenty of free parking available."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",10/27/2017,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Absolutely my favorite place ever. The staff is beyond amazing. I always get taro or coffee Boba here, and the vegan gyoza. The only thing is that I wish they had LOWER PRICES. this is next to fiu and a lot of my friends don't like to go since a bowl of noodles is $13. It is a bit over priced. But nonetheless AMAZING food. Amazing staff. Amazing decoration"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",7/9/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"What a great little restaurant. Really polite service, especially from Vanessa who I had a very nice conversation with at the bar. Vegan options are also available. I had the Pad See Ew with tofu and no eggs and it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",2/12/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I lost track of how many times I've been to this gem. After a long day of studying, it's so comforting to indulge myself in a hot bowl of ramen. Flavorful food and divine desserts. The Spicy Ramen is amazingggg. It doesn't matter if it's chicken, shrimp, pork, or tofu; they're all lovely. They also have a ton of vegan options which is a huge plus. Make sure to leave room for dessert! My favorite dish here is the Zombie Plant! Only order it if you have enough time to wait for it to be prepared because it does take a long time (~25 minutes). I promise you it is worth every second. It has layer over layer of ice cream, fruit and pound cake all topped with ""dirt"" and served with milk on the side to pour over. It is to die for!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",1/8/2018,$$,3,107 Taste 味,"I found this place while looking for vegan/vegetarian friendly places. Loved the spicy ramen. All tough the menu says to advise them if you are VEGAN, DO NOT, been here three and times they have practically laughed in my face all of them. Matcha latte, recommended as well as the vegetable steamed dumplings. Downside, the plastic utensils. Love the menu options and ambience, only wish they were more mind-full of peoples dietary choices."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",4/10/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"After finding this place on yelp about two months ago it has become our favorite spot! We've gone maybe 12 times since. The food is absolutely delicious. There's nothing that I've tried from here that isn't amazing. My top favorites are Spicy Ramen, Yaki Udon and Pad Thai! Best part is that they have vegan friendly versions. The staff is extremely kind and it feels like you're eating at a friends house because of how comfortable this spot is. Check it out, you won't regret it."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/6/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"This place is incredible! They have delicious food and excellent service. Halley really elevated the experience, she has exceptional customer service skills, she is friendly and professional. Halley recommended the spicy ramen as well as the nutella crepe cake and I'm so happy I ordered both because they were amazing. I love that this cafe offers vegan/vegetarian options so regardless of your dietary choices, you will find something and it will be great."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",6/28/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,This place is amazing honestly i gotta say food is authentic and exquisite at a reasonable price they accommodate vegans vegetarian this place is great place to come and relax and enjoy the food of another culture.
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",7/8/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Accidentally found this little cafe and I was pleasantly surprised to find clearly labeled vegan options!,The staff is always so nice, welcoming, and knowledgeable about the ingredients used in food. They will happily accommodate most dishes! ,My favorite is the sweet and sour tofu. I also love the strawberry milk tea and matcha latte that they can make with soymilk! They also have coffee and other teas available. I will definitely keep coming to this place all the time! The food is delicious and the service is great!"
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",5/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"I've tried many spots for Ramen and this place is by far the best in Miami. I always order a Vegan Shio Ramen along with the Vegan Gyoza's and/or the Vegan Pad Thai. All the food is always made to order so it comes out warm and fresh. The taste of the broth in the ramen is delicious (add a little sirracha if you want a spicy kick), the pad thai noodles are always cooked very well (add cabbage!). For dessert I always get the Nutella Crepe Cake which is probably what the restaurant is known most for.,This is a order over the counter restaurant but the lovely staff brings you your food to the table once its ready. The restaurant is usually busy but they always manage to bring out the food in a timely manner. I am excited to continue to come to this establishment and try some of their other items as they all look so great! I come here almost every week and would recommend any Yelper's out there to do so as well."
"1679 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33165",8/7/2018,$$,5,107 Taste 味,"Love this place! Great bubble tea, easy to make something vegan or shellfish free if needed. Lots of tasty options. My only complaint is that I wish they had lunch specials and I way to combine small plates. They should really think about having a menu like that especially for the students and university lunch community."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/15/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Great tacos great atmosphere. Went here during art walk late one night and was so surprised. I got the carne asada tacos and they were exactly what I wanted them to be. Real authentic Mexican tacos. Not that Tex mex junk. A little wedge of lime and some salsa verde and my life was made. I also got a side of guac and chips =amazing. Kinda weird tho bc if you order guac it doesn't come with chips, they're separate. But whatever. They chips were fresh and maybe the best I've had. I was concerned bc my friend is a vegan and I was expecting them to not have a vegan option but they did (I think it was cactus and quinoa) which she said were good. I was veryyyy full and very happy."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,5,Coyo Taco,"At least a couple good vegetarian/vegan options. Very good guac. I assume they use California Hass avocados instead of gross watery Florida ones, but I could be wrong about that."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/19/2016,$$,4,Coyo Taco,Best tacos in Wynwood. Comes two per order and wide variety to choose from. For the meat lovers as well as the vegans and pescatarians. Cold brews and a good selection of fresh made sauces to customize your taco.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/26/2015,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"Came here after a moto ride down to mia and they guys didn't seem to fond of the place but I thought it was pretty good. Guys are super picky anyways. Being a vegan, I ordered the nopales without cheese or sauce and it must have been too difficult to not put cheese on it. I had to send it back to the kitchen and they took some of the cheese off and gave it back to me. Things NOT to do to a vegan. I ended up eating around it because I'm not that much of a bitch. I also ordered a side of black beans (which were refried). Overall I thought the tacos were really good and I'm never gonna live down the heat of ordering a cactus taco LOLZ"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/20/2017,$$,5,Coyo Taco,Loved this place! The food was great...freshly prepared and fast. I loved the vibe and they had a dj and the music was awesome and eclectic.  It was vegan friendly which was a huge plus. The line was long but they moved fast and it was worth the wait. Definitely a cool spot to grab some good food and drinks that's super casual. I'm a pretty picky eater and I enjoyed this place.
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/7/2017,$$,4,Coyo Taco,"NOM NOM NOM. so freaking tasty. Food is fresh, amazing quality, options for vegans/vegetarians and great vibe too. Love the outdoor seating. I am giving this place stars because I think for a place with such amazing tacos, they could def make some better guac! Margs are great here too. Never would have thought that a mushroom taco would taste so out of this world! Other than that, keep it up Coyo!"
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/7/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"I had dinner here a few weeks ago, before exploring art walk and the galleries. And by dinner I mean, I nibbled on some tortilla chips with salsa. Lol. It's not the best place to go if you're vegan, but I realize that it's not a restaurant that is focused on that...but right next door there is a vegan friendly cafe! So keep that in mind if that's what you're craving. ,Anyway, Coyo Taco is okay butttt I really wish they had offered more veggie tacos. They didn't have a lot of options, even for vegetarians (from what I saw, but perhaps I am too picky), and the place just didn't seem to do it for me. Something about their tacos seemed unappetizing. Their prices were decent enough, and the location is great (who doesn't love Wynwood?), but if you're looking to eat tacos, there are other places to enjoy a meal in Miami which are much more aesthetically pleasing, committed to all dietary needs, spacious, and just more fun overall. We were barely able to find seats because the restaurant was overcrowded (and it was earlier in the night, too). I suppose it is meant to be an in and out food joint, and not really a place to lounge and enjoy the night."
"2300 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/3/2017,$$,3,Coyo Taco,"This place is always busy and it's definitely because of their food and their club room behind their restaurant. However, they don't have a huge array of options and I wouldn't consider their service to be that great either. The lady who was serving me clearly knew I was vegan and she deliberately added cheese to the mushroom tacos I had ordered. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered the mushroom tacos since I'm not particularly a fan of them but I did manage to get a bite or two in before losing my appetite and switching over to their guacamole and chips. ,I honestly think when I come back to this area since my boyfriend likes this place and knows it's cheap in comparison to other restaurants, I'll either eat prior to coming or just order a portion of their guac and chips. They were absolutely delicious but the main reason I'm giving this place three stars is because their customer service really lacks and are quite rude. Also because they haven't bothered to try and add more seating which always means that a lot of people end up standing up while eating."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/22/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This market has something from everyone plus a fun atmosphere! From sushi to italian to a delicious vegan bakery, St. Roch Market is the next big Food Hall in Miami. Located in the upscale Design District, this market has a center bar, lot's of seating, and 10 food vendors to choose from. You order you food, find a place to seat, and pick up your food when you recieve a text letting you know it is ready. The staff are all wonderful and will help you decide on what to get to eat. I recommend ending your meal over at Chef Chloe & The Vegan Cafe for an amazing treat. Their cookies, cakes, and more taste delcious and are the perfect dessert."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,So great! So many options. You can eat food from all over the world all at once. Very cool vibe and very nice people. Plus the Chloe vegan bakery is amazing. About time we got one in miami.
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/18/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Great new spot, lots of options. Try the authentic homemade pasta made on the spot, or the vegan options at Cleo - the cashew butternut cream nachos were amazing!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/12/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,Love the variety of food here. Many vegan options. You definitely need to pop over to Chef Chloe for the best ending to your meal. I love that the food hall has a vegan option at almost every vendor. It's awesome to be able to grab a delicious refreshing smoothie and head out to the terrace for a nice swing. Enjoy!
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I really love the concept of this higher end food court with healthy varieties! There's Italian, different types of Asian foods, vegan foods, smoothies and bowls, and a coffee bar just to name a few. I ordered the Ramen and honestly...not good. Avoid that. Bland and way overpriced for what it tasted like. BUT try the Avocado Salad from Chloe's and you'll LOVE it. There's a bar at the center for cocktails and wine and you can get drinks from the different markets. Definitely go with friends, grab drinks, and enjoy!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Really good has about 12 vendors of food . Tacos , vegan cafe ( which was amazing) and Asian food . The have char grilled oysters at another place . My favorite was the vegan cafe (the vegan nachos are amazing ) as wells as the large delicious guacamole salad . Def a must try"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"This is an open market with many small food vendors and a bar in the middle. This spot was an awesome experience with friendly chefs rolling fresh pasta, excellent vegan desserts, and yummy cocktails made by friendly bartenders. I would definitely recommend stopping here for a bite while shopping in the awesome boutiques in the area."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/27/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Great little food hall with lots of vegan options!!! My boyfriend and I got the spicy tofu banh mi sandwich  at Tran An and the vegan ramen at Yuzu. The sandwich was pretty good (pretty small for the price) but the ramen was to DIE FOR. ,It had tons of wonderful veggies and mushrooms, lots of flavor, and was a huge portion! Pro tip: ask them to split one order into two bowls for you. It's great to share! It was by far the best vegan ramen I've ever had. ,We would've gotten some desserts at Chef Chloe's place but it was late and they had sold out by the time we finished eating dinner. Their treats looked and smelled delicious though! ,Highly recommend this place for great vegan options!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/20/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"St.Roch was our final stop during our Miami trip! I love Chef Chloe and saw on her Instagram that she had opened up a cafe at this new market. Obviously I had told my fiancé that I wanted to check out this place well before we even got to Miami! Lucky for me he made sure we ended our trip with brunch at St.Roch Market. His friends who live in Miami hadn't heard of this food hall yet (I deff felt like an insider lol). St. Roch Market is part of a newly developed high end shopping center. It is modern, has a variety of food vendors (Israeli, sushi, Mexican, Vietnamese, vegan desserts, full bar, coffee shop, Italian, acai bowls/juice shop etc), AND tons of seating! We also saw a birthday party going on- so that's something to keep in mind if you need a place to celebrate.Their eyes almost popped out of their heads as they walked around trying to decide what to eat! I opted for a falafel platter from the Israeli vendor (Jaffa). The food was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully presented! For dessert I obviously went to Chef Chloe's cafe and got a chocolate chip sea salt cookie- chewy, perfect sweet/salty balance & ginormous chips atop the cookie (total win!) The guys tried the sushi, bhan mi sandwich, sushi, Mexican corn, the shawarma platter, and coffee. Everyone loved their food and they can't wait to bring their friends/S.O  #yourwelcome #thanksinstagram"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/4/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So excited about this new food market in the design district! Plenty of ethnic food options for a price that's relatively affordable, especially when considering the design district location! Exciting to have exciting new food options in this food hall, instead of common chains that I'm used to seeing around Miami. Hard to decide between all of the food vendors, especially since all had vegetarian and vegan friendly options. Will be back to try out more!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"I loved this place since I found out about it 3 months ago. It's great to have several different options so everyone in the group is happy, wherever your vegan or a total carnivore like me. I've tried 3 of the places already, and loved the Vietnamese food particularly, but can't wait to try everything since I haven't been disappointed yet. It's great to have both seating outside and inside with beautiful hammock/chairs under canopy of vines."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/2/2018,$$,3,St. Roch Market,"Looks like the food market idea is becoming more popular now. It's a great concept since there's a variety for all taste buds! I ordered ""Yuzu's"" Vegan noodle bowl and it was tasty, good size, but way too pricey. I paid $19, and felt it was a bit absurd for ramens.  My boyfriend had ""Hot Lime"" which is the Mexican Taco spot... he loved it! He had the chicken, the shortie taco with beef short rib, and the vegan taco which were amazing, but they were too small, gone in 2 bites. But we'll definitely be back for the tacos and to try different spots."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/15/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"So much better than I was expecting! The quality of everything was excellent and so much variety! This is the perfect spot to go to if you're with a group.. there is something for everyone! Oyster bar, juice/smoothie bowl bar, hummus bar, asian fusion, Italian, tacos/ceviche, Vietnamese, vegan bakery, southern soul food.. all top quality."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/26/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"I'm so glad more food halls are opening in Miami! St. Roch Market (apparently pronounced ""Rock"") is a great addition to Miami's growing roster of food halls. I checked it out this morning after learning about it on Chef Chloe Coscarelli's instagram, where she announced that she will have her own all-vegan stall in the market. , ,The place definitely fits within the Design District. It's a clean open space above Estefan Kitchen with a range of stalls - from asian and italian to coffee and smoothies. , ,I tried a basic açaí bowl from SweetBlendz and was a bit disappointed when I saw that the açaí puree was pre-made - but that quickly changed once I tried a bite and realized how yummy the puree actually is. I'd definitely recommend getting a bowl. It's topped with all kinds of fruit and is a decent size to fill you up. , ,One caveat to the whole place - everything's pretty pricey. My açaí bowl was about $12. A quick browse of the rest of the shops showed similarly high prices. I'll have to try more to see if the prices are worth it! Definitely looking forward to testing Chef Chloe's vegan goodies!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Excellent new spot in the Miami Design District with great options for a variety of cravings. Tacos? Chicken rice? Vegan cupcakes and matcha soft serve? You got it! Also, working on a random day and having some coffee to enjoy the ambiance is a great idea at St. Roch Market. ,Highly recommend the hummus from Jaffa, the peanut butter cookie from Chloe and the coffee from Sabal, of course!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/28/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Came over to St. Roch Market last night with a friend for dinner. I was instantly impressed with the decor and the variety of options it had to offer. From Meditteranean, Italian, Mexican, Vegan and more--with so many options it was hard to choose!,I ended up grabbing some tacos with my friend at the station called Hot Lime. I tried the short rib taco and the pork taco ($10 for two tacos or $14 for three). Absolutely delicious and satisfying! The guac ($9) we ordered as a side was made fresh but I personally didn't feel like the price tag matched the taste. Still good and would definitely recommend trying Hot Lime out.,We later had vegan dessert at Chole which was absolutely delicious! Whatever you do, please order the Strawberry Chocolate Cupcake. Soooo good! It may be vegan but it tastes just like chocolate. Could've fooled me.,On to the service at St. Roch Market...,The only reason I deducted one star was that of the service employees. My friend and I arrive around 7:45 PM on a Tuesday evening, it was not busy whatsoever. However, the bussers kept hovering over us to clean up our plates. We were asked SIX times (in a span of 15-20 mins) if they could remove our plates (which we were nowhere near done) simply because we were talking and enjoying our conversation. We finally gave up and left because of the pushy bussers. Honestly, this was my main complaint. No one wants to be rushed during dinner.,Overall, minus the pushy and annoying bussers, I'd come back to grab a bite soon!"
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"My crew (my wifey and sister-in-law) and I decided to try the new St. Roch Market in the Miami Design District. It's been open for about a month and it's a nice addition to the district. Its on the second floor of the shopping area and parking is very easy. There's valet or a self park garage. Let me tell you a little about the layout -- it's a food hall. There's about 10 food stands and they all have menus to pick from. There's seafood, chicken and waffles at a stand called ""Coop"". Ramen noodle soup at ""yuzu"". tacos  , chips and fresh made guacamole at ""hot lime"".  There also vegan  options in almost every stand. One of the details I did notice was that the staff working the tables and cleaning were very nice and doing an excellent job keeping the area clean. That's always a plus and The prices were reasonable. ,St. Roch Market is a nice addition to the Miami Design District. I recommend you try it for a afternoon or dinner."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/29/2018,$$,5,St. Roch Market,"Okay Eat! By Chloe is the best thing to happen to Miami! I love Vegan food and vegan options and this place has everything you want, but better! I tried the sprinkle cupcake and it tastes like heaven with sprinkles on it! Chocolatey deliciousness! Then the vegan nachos were AMAZING! I'd definitely share next time but also probably not because I ate all of them anyway! They were sweet but also salty and the toppings were perfect. Then the dragonfruit drink was so sour and sweet and perfect for a hot summer day. I wish I can eat here everyday ... maybe I will."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",7/30/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"Today was my second time here. Chef Chloe's place is ok... now there's only one savory option and it's the truffle avocado toast. How creative. Before there was a few other things and they were worth the visit, but now those are out. The vegan desserts have been on the dry side, none of them mind blowing. ,However, pretty much all the other vendors have amazing vegan options. Jaffa has plenty of Mediterranean plates and dairy free ice cream flavors. Don't miss out on this place. Healthy food with lots of flavor. ,The Japanese place has vegan sushi rolls which were delicious. ,Happy hour at the bar is great too."
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/19/2018,$$,4,St. Roch Market,"So far I've tried a banh mi from Tran An, sushi roll from Itamae, ramen from Yuzu, açaí bowl from Sweetblendz, and desserts and nachos from Chole and the Vegan Cafe. Everything was good, but the only place that really stood out to me was Chole and the Vegan Cafe.,Which also made me realize, this food hall is relatively vegan friendly. There's the obvious Chloe and the Vegan Cafe whose desserts have me thinking about them days later. But also, Yuzu makes a vegan ramen. I'm still on the hunt for a satisfying bowl of ramen in Miami, but the one at Yuzu is not bad (they'll even split it into two bowls if you want to share a few different things with a friend!).,If you're deciding between food halls, I prefer 1-800 Lucky in Wynwood or even Jackson Hall in the Health District. But St. Roch Market definitely fills a niche of its own in the bougie Miami Design District."
"788 Brickell Plz, Miami, FL 33131",5/6/2017,$$$,5,Quinto La Huella,My favorite place in Miami for brunch. Not only a paradise for meat eaters but vegetarians and vegans alike. Lovely ambience with live music on sundays. I do wish however there was a lower price for non meat eater like myself who only eat from the salad bars..
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",7/18/2017,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Yes. Yum. Thank you, Ghee, for bringing conscientious diversity to Miami. Farm fresh, local food, organic and sustainable wines, and plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free offerings. This night started with attentive service from Gabriel at the bar. His suggestions and explanations unfolded the menu for my husband and I like the petals on a lotus. The night ended with a delicious cake by pastry chef Alex, whose palette is clearly something exceptional. Everything in between was flawless. We will be back. ,...and we came back. Sooo yummy again. We had more yummy veggie offerings while our friends raved about the lamb. Service and food were immaculate -again. Alex (pastry chef) recognized us from a couple nights ago and personally greeted us. This time dessert was the date cake and Benin a cake. ***spoiler alert: these desserts will give you cravings and cause you to return."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",4/8/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Farm to table food. Delicious!  Have been there a few times and the food has always been excellent. The service is fantastic. The menu denotes gluten free, vegan and vegetarian choices."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",2/22/2018,$$,4,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"We came on a busy Saturday evening, and snagged the last two chairs at the bar (no reservation needed there!) between two friendly groups who were happy to adjust a bit so we could all have our elbow space. The decor is lovely, and while the restaurant was loud, everyone was friendly and welcoming. The menu is also incredibly GF and vegan friendly, so we have an immediate go-to when our dietarily restricted friends come to visit!,Truly great service from Gabriel this past weekend. We would visit again and sit at the bar just so we could say hi. The SO is a chatter, so I think he liked having someone to talk it up with. Gabriel had great suggestions for us based on what was fresh from their Homestead farm, and when he heard I appreciated a hearty spice, he brought by a sample of their house marinated chiles to try. Our waters were kept filled, and we had a great view of the chefs at work. To note, dishes came out at an interesting pace (we got there and ordered after our neighbors and received literally every dish before they did).,Now for the food - it was all worth a try, though some plates were a bit of a letdown in terms of flavor and straight Americanized-fusion nonsense. Let's start with my least favorite of the night - the ghost pepper-cheesy naan. Just don't get it. One, if you ordered it for any spice flavor, there is none. It's straight up just damp, cheesy naan. Paired with my curry, it was not the right flavor or texture. I stole my SO's garlic naan instead - much better and perfectly garlicky as one would expect.,Then the papadum. Normally a salty, crispy starter that you would dip in a sweet chutney (or for me, the spicy sauce), it was placed in front of us fully topped like a giant nacho. A tomato salsa-like chutney was all you could see. And taste. And that's just...not what I wanted or expected. But I still ate it.,And the pork belly vindaloo. If there's a vindaloo or a jalfrezi, no matter what else is on the menu, that's going in my belly - at any Indian restaurant or home. Especially one that is inspired by Western Indian dishes. Here, while the pork belly was generous, the flavor was missing something special. Also, a noticeable lack of fiery kick despite there being scotch bonnets on the ingredient list. (No substitutions or additions on the curries, as they are made the day of and stewed for hours).,After all my negativity, you must be wondering where the four stars come from (or maybe not). The lamb shank biryani was a redeemer. Flavorful, generous, a pomegranate crunch, and just all around wonderful. We would order it again without a doubt. The SO also had the grilled sweet corn and the poriyal (again, fresh from the farm). It was incredible how the chefs were able to transform simple ingredients like lima beans and lentils into something so flavorful and filling.,In the end, Ghee really shines with their simple and farm-to-table dishes. I'm ready to order one of every vegetable dish on the menu, and hesitate on the curries. What I'm most excited about is if/when they start hosting like, giant family dinners on their production farm. That would be a big treat to see just where my dinner came from."
"8965 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",6/23/2018,$$,3,Ghee Indian Kitchen,"Ambience is great, in Miami's Design District. Food is served as shareable. While prices off the menu look cheap, consider yourself warned that portions are small. For an Indian restaurant, I was surprised to find that there weren't that many well rounded options here in terms of protein for us vegans. Most likely won't be back."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",1/3/2018,$,4,Spoleto,"Been to Spoleto at Dadeland Mall twice and loved the fresh options, generous portions,  homemade pasta and Flatbread. They make everything in front of you from scratch!  Food is definitely better than anything in the food court and much better prices than the larger restaurants.  For the most part a very committed young staff. Make sure you are very clear when you are specifying vegan or vegetarian."
"2320 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/19/2017,$$,4,Ono Poké Shop,"Hands down, best Poke shop in South Florida. Great flavor and pairing within the bowls, love the side selection of Japanese snacks, and obsess over the drink choices in the fridge. Especially the cold brew tea, I tried Jasper Chai and it was so good! Only downside is you can't roll in there with a meat eater or a vegan, no cooked meat options and no animal free options."
"1180 SW 57th Ave, Miami, FL 33144",8/19/2017,$$,5,Sakura Sushi & Bar,"Great service, staff is very kind and helpful. Definitely a repeat customer after my first visit. Great vegetarian/vegan options as well as a cozy environment inside."
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/14/2015,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,"Best lunch spot downtown and also a great place to have a quiet wine or sake after work or a quick, inexpensive, and healthful dinner if leaving work late or you happen to be near downtown - especially if you have vegan or vegetarian friends, who will appreciate how many choices they have to select from on the menu.  My officemates and I go there or have it delivered several times per week.  The beefy Korean over mixed field greens is my personal favorite and I just learned they will do extra protein for wraps and salads!.  I love the made-in-house iced teas.  It also turned out to be a fantastic catering option I have done twice - I had them do a selection of rolls and cut the rolls into quarters, and guests have absolutely loved all of the choices.  I appreciate their devotion to quality ingredients and clean eating while not sacrificing flavor through the amazing sauces or texture with the veggies choices for each kind of salad/wrap.  It never gets boring because they have so many customized choices - brown rice, white rice, salad, or salad with the quinoa/buckwheat mixture.  And for that person in the group who balks at healthful fare, they have Asian nachos and crème brulee.  Yum."
"11401 NW 12th St, Miami, FL 33172",4/30/2014,$$$,4,Texas de Brazil,"Strictly reviewing the salad bar - great selection, appreciated that they had more than one lettuce option!  The garbanzo & 3 bean salad was delicious,  the cheesy bunuelos were tasty and pillowy,  the mash potatoes were ok a little watery but ok tasting, the party I was with enjoyed all the cuts of meat, especially the bacon wrapped filet and picanha, the desserts were wonderful as well. Would totally go back - great vegetarian/vegan selection even though it's a churrasqueria"
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",5/9/2017,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,"Omg! These sushi burritos are so good. Comes in a good portion size (its not big, its not small either) and so tasty! The delivery was very quick. I plan to go there and eat because my Buddha burrito was SO GOOD. Also, as a vegetarian I appreciate vegan/vegetarian options that are as tasty as their regular food."
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",2/6/2018,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,"Great service, not very packed when I went which I loved it's nice to be able to breathe in all the downtown craziness but it was my first time so I can't really tell if it's always like that. The burritos were delicious you really get such a great portion for everything you pay for. The only weird thing was the little chips that come with the burrito just had a sweet tangy Taste I couldn't get my hands on but it was just huge wontons with nothing to really dip them in. It just seemed odd to be but each to its own I was too full regardless to eat them. I ordered the schezuan eggplant which was amazing very fresh eggplant not over cooked and not tart at all perfect texture and firmness yet soft. Simply delicious ! I'd go again just for this side. Let me mention it's only $5 and you get a HUGE portion of eggplant like what I get from half of one. I also got the saucy tofu burrito HUGE pieces of tofu really packed with everything I added seaweed for only $1. Im a vegan so I didn't get to try any of the other delicious options but my friend ordered a poke it looked delicious for $16 we ate really good and it kept me full for 2 hours Im a munchie monster I have to have something in my mouth every 20 minutes but this kept me happy for a while which I appreciate. Love that things are organic. I was so excited to try a sushi burrito and let me tell you this is the spot ! Just wish there was more options for your burrito sides cause the chips were too strange for me. But still amazing !! And a very nice staff"
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",5/21/2017,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,I am completely obsessed with this place! The service is always great. I've been here probably about 6 times now and every time it's just as delicious. Plenty of choices on the menu to choose from. My favorite is their saucy tofu burrito and I'm NOT a vegan. I've tried almost all of their burritos by now and they are all good. On top of good food they also keep this place very clean which I am a big fan of. Christopher and I recently just signed up for their loyalty program and we are very happy about it!
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",10/29/2016,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,"As a vegan with a non-vegan spouse this is fantastic place for us. Food is fresh. The flavors are amazing! I had the Shanghai Book Choy and the Buddha's Belly salad. They were delicious! The salad is quite large. My husband had the Asian Nachos, Masala Chicken Burrito and Mandarin Creme Brûlée. He was only able to eat half the burrito and he said the creme brûlée had a thicker consistency than he would have liked. It should have been served at room temperature. Service was good. This was her first time here. We will definitely come back."
"119 SE 1st Ave, Miami, FL 33131",5/29/2016,$$,5,YūGō Sushi Burritos - Poké,"I absolutely love this restaurant. Their food is fresh, healthy, and delicious. They even have vegetarian/vegan options! The wait time for your food is minimal for dine in and even if you deliver they are very quick. ,I have ordered the Buddha burrito roll and tofu burrito roll from here and Thai donut rolls. Both rolls are delicious but I would definitely recommend getting the donut rolls! Overall, I have had a great experience every time I order from here."
"1731 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",3/14/2017,$$,3,Lung Yai Thai Tapas,"I was in the neighborhood looking for Asian restaurants, I read the reviews stating that they had vegetarian options so I stopped in. It is a small thai open kitchen with counter seating and a smaller adjacent dining area. I was greeted promptly by a lovely thai server. I told her I was interested in vegetarian options and I was sadly disappointed. Every entree has fish sauce in it so I opted for the spring rolls and crispy mushrooms. The food was good but I really wanted AUTHENTIC Thai food, not ""snacks"".  I would have given this 5 stars but not having many vegan/vegetarian options is why I'm giving 3. I recommend going here if you eat meat. Also they will not seat you until your whole party is there, so get there together and be prepared to wait."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/22/2015,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Two girlfriends took me to my favorite restaurant, Michael's Genuine, yesterday for my birthday. Lunch was fabulous!  We ordered hominy and falafel to snack on, yum. One is vegan and enjoyed the falafel wrap. Me and the other shared the butter lettuce salad with grilled steak and a bottle of Sauvignon blanc. For dessert we devoured the pot de cream, and Rosemary doughnuts. WOW, ROSEMARY DOUGHNUTS!!!!! Incredible. Can't wait to go go back :)"
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/14/2013,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"I have been waiting to dine at Michael's for quite some time now, so we stopped in for a drink at the bar, the dinner menu would have proved tough for two vegans.  ,After propping ourselves up on the chairs, we ordered the Cabarete and Ginger-Lemongrass Homemade Soda, and the bartender went straight to work. Both were deliciously well-crafted, and we started feeling a bit of envy that we were unable to stay for dinner, or, all night for that matter. Sigh. ,The over-all experience seemed much more expensive than the bill actually was, and the atmosphere, was indescribably un-Miami, Miami. ,For a few minutes we feel transported else where, then, the parking meter ran out."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2016,$$$,4,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,"Went here this morning. Sunday breakfast. Open earlier than most restaurants in the area. Very unique menu, absolutely delicious food. Everyone loved everything, but very small portions which the waiter did tell us from the get-go. Also, I do wish there were a few more vegetarian or vegan options. With such a creative and unique menu, I'm sure they can come up with something. I will be back though."
"130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/18/2018,$$$,5,Michael’s Genuine Food & Drink,Been coming here for years.  Always wonderful.  The staff is so helpful and nice.  They are always accommodating for vegan dishes.  Great atmosphere.  I don't attempt brunch anymore because it is so packed.  But I love coming for an early dinner.

"2423 Galiano St, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/4/2018,$$,5,Stephanie’s Crepes,Absolutely positively delicious crepes. Vegans: Order the Veggi Edamame (without the aioli); it does not disappoint! And the Protein Choco-Nana is made with Vega protein powder and almond butter...so good! And my bros loved Scrambled Eggs with Cheddar; they even ordered another after devouring the first!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/26/2016,$$,5,The Spillover,Vegan crab cakes!!!!! Delicious!!!! Guava cake and tres leches desert is amazing. They even have a dog menu. I love it!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/18/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,This place was great! Great service and the food was amazing. The vegan crab cake was so tasty. Highly recommended.
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Love cauliflower buffalo, vegan crab cakes, awesome kombucha. Hidden gem. My favorite in coconut grove."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/23/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Lovely ambience and excellent service. The music takes one back to various eras so if you're open to oldies and jazz like music then this place is a no brainer. I had the vegan crab cake with a side of cauliflower mash and an appetizer of fried conch, both orders were extremely tasteful. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafoods or drinks."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",5/1/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Great restaurant!! I was wowed when I first went, and when I went again! The Vegan Crab Cakes had me at first taste. And the Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer, ooof. The service is great, the vibe is great, and yep, so is the food. You definitely want to go here at least once. Your tummy deserves it. :)"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/25/2016,$$,4,The Spillover,"Came here based on reviews before realizing it was mainly seafood. I opted for vegan crab cakes which were basically over-seasoned veggie patties, and too spicy to enjoy. Others in my party had the lamb burger which was ok and the lobster Reuben which seemed to be a hit. Would have given this 3 stars but beer selection is great, service was fair, and decor was creative. Definitely worth a try."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/27/2017,$$,3,The Spillover,"My carnivorous family loved their meal, but unfortunately I am a vegan. Oddly enough, the only vegan sandwich option used honey in the sauce and in the making of the bread. While I am sure the bread and sauce were delicious I do not eat honey and felt mislead by browsing the menu online before trying this place. However, the waitress was very helpful and lovely."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,Yum! The vegan crab cake sandwich is my favorite. Throw in some sweet potatoes fries and it's a home run. Try the ciders they are refreshing!
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/2/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"So many good options on the menu. Before I went vegan I tried the buffalo cauliflower (appetizer), pan con minuta, the burger and deserts. None of it disappointed. Passed by today and had the vegan crab cakes, they were pretty satisfying! Our server was great as always. Check this place out."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/9/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Another fabulous eatery from the Lokal restaurant group. Although I don't quite get the theme of the spillover, the food did not disappoint! I enjoyed a savory vegan ""crab cake"" sandwich with a side of grilled mushrooms. I also tried the gator BBQ ribs which were also great. ,The guava bread pudding really hit the spot with guava marmalade oozing out of it. ,I'll definitely return to try more dishes."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",4/20/2018,$$,4,The Spillover,"Great happy hour with good food and great beer. Lovely to sit outside with our pooches. The vegan burger is so delicious. As were the buffalo cauliflower and snapper bites. Austin, our waiter, was very attentive. I've come a few times and this was the best experience so far. This is not a ""fancy"" place with ""fancy"" food. Just good stuff excited well for a good price. Can't beat that..."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/25/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Really great restaurant!! I went with my family a few weeks ago and celebrated my birthday and we were all really impressed. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather that evening. There's an amazing selection of ciders, beers, and mead to choose from. My mom, who never drinks, found a nice Swedish pear cider that she really liked. My family shared the fish dip as an appetizer and all had high praises. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and absolutely loved it!! The menu also said there were more vegan and gluten free options available for those with dietary restrictions. We finished the meal with some guava bread pudding and chocolate cake which the family really enjoyed. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in coconut grove!"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/5/2018,$$,3,The Spillover,"The restaurant has a lot of cool and funky decorations that give it a very unique feel. Spillover is a seafood restaurant that also has a wide variety of other menu options, and even some exotic options such as gator ribs. In addition they also offer vegan, and also dog friendly menu options. I came here a couple of weeks ago and ordered the jambalaya, while it was flavorful the sausage and chicken were quite dry, and there was barely any shrimp in the giant portion. While it was tasty the quality of the meat was quite disappointing. However, the bread that it came with was very delicious, and the meal was plated very beautiful. One warning is that they will charge you a dollar for water since they use a fancy filter to filter it. Based on the other great reviews my experience here may have possibly been a fluke, and The Spillover may be worth trying again."
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/31/2017,$$,5,The Spillover,"Came here with the bf for a Friday night date and we had a great time! We got there around 7:30 and there was a wait so we decided to sit at the bar. Vanessa was a super great bartender and server. She took great care of us and gave us enough attention without making us feel constantly watched. The buffalo cauliflower was really yummy and a great appetizer. We also were  treated to the fish dip due to a delay in our food. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but the bf liked it ok. I ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich and I loved it! Great flavors and texture and the 50/50 fries go perfectly with it. My bf ordered the lobster reuben and claims it's ""his most favorite sandwich ever"" so we will definitely be coming back again! Overall I had a really nice meal and can't wait to come back to try out more of the menu!"
"2911 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/22/2018,$$,5,The Spillover,"Such an amazing place! Small/medium intimate space that seems like a gem of a find. Decided to try it based off yelp reviews & thankfully, I was not disappointed. I ordered the veggie pasta and shrimp. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a great one. Such a light, healthy feeling meal but still fulfilling. Even the simple toast on the side complimented the sauce of the pasta. Would definitely recommend, plus they have vegetarian and vegan options."

Greeted by Matthew, my server in a tux t-shirt I received the same quality of service I would in an upscale restaurant, if not better. Food? Truly outstanding. In the mood for veggies? Their veggie menu will inspire you to go vegan. The chef Derek Camejo came over to make sure my meal was good and introduce himself. The camaraderie of the small staff was easygoing and authentic. The decor was simple,clean with a touch of artsy vintage. I'd be happy to visit again."

"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/2/2017,$$,3,Blue Collar,"First time here for my girlfriends birthday. I'm vegan and was a bit worried I was not going to be able to enjoy anything. Luckily, they did have a few vegan options in their veggie section, not too many but atleast some. The food was tasty and filling and a pretty good price for the size of the dishes. The service was not all that great. The server could answer all my questions but the bussing was lacking. They really did not bother actually picking up the plates, as we all had to pass our own plates to the busser, and also did not even bother to wipe out table a bit, pour our water or wine. Maybe I was expecting too much but I think if I was really hungry and around the area I would come back."
"6730 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",9/23/2017,$$,5,Blue Collar,"I love Blue Collar! I am in no way a vegan or a vegetarian, but all I ever get here is the veggie platter.,This time I got the roasted beets, the collard greens with bacon, the mashed yukon golds, and the sautéed mushrooms. I tried to save half of the plate to bring home, but I ate it all! ,I have brought many friends who all enjoy eating here."
"3438 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",9/18/2016,$$,5,Red Carpet Italian,"Great place. Very quick service and good food for the price. The staff was very nice and it was a very clean, profesional place. Would recommend. Many options that are vegan friendly. I had the whole wheat pasta with vegetables and marinara sauce. It was delicious!"
"1155 Brickell Bay Dr, Miami, FL 33131",10/29/2017,$$,5,Crazy About You,"It was my first time at Crazy About You, & we were celebrating our anniversary. I looked at the menu options, & advised our server, Luis, that I was vegan. Although there weren't many vegan options, Luis advised the chef to personally make a special dish for me. He came out with a delicious quinoa salad (not the one on the menu). Luis was very courteous and very attentive to my needs (I'm also allergic to avocadoes), I will definitely visit CAY more often for brunch! Thank you Luis! (-:"
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2016,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,"Delicious, fresh and simple yet flavorful dishes. Had the vegan risotto, organic carrots out of this world ! Service was very good. Limited wine selection by the glass. But good choices for draft beers. Will definitely be back."
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/13/2016,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,"Excellent food and amazing service in a fun,casual setting. Outstanding octopus and loved the vegan cauliflower soup. Ceviche was very well-balanced instead of the very acidic style at many restaurants. Definitely will come back to this place soon!"
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/23/2017,$$,5,Pinch Kitchen,knew their vegan stuff and my non-vegan friends completely feasted! Wonderful place for everyone to dine :)
"8601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",4/29/2018,$$,4,Pinch Kitchen,Bohemian meets neighbourhood joint meets young and sassy.  I ordered the impossible vegan burger and it was impressive in look and taste.  My mom had the pulled pork sandwich and she responded favourably to it.  This is not a normal menu item by the way.  Service here is friendly but I found it to be a bit inconsistent.  Ice tea is good but not to be charging $4.50 for it.  The restaurant has limited inside only seating so always a good idea to get a table reservation before arriving.  There is some parking around the building but it is rather limited as well.  All in all it lives up to the 4 star and higher rating for a casual restaurant and any place that plays Pass the Dutchie is alright in my book.
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",9/14/2016,$$,5,Glass & Vine,"I absolutely loved this place ! Great for sharing, it's tapas style.  Really great selection for everyone, vegetarians, vegans and carnivores alike ! The cauliflower was to die for, as well as the scallops ! They also had an excellent cheese bread (forgot the name) perfect for a date night of ladies nights it's all good ! Give this place a try, it was close to perfect!"
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/20/2017,$$,5,Glass & Vine,"What a wonderful place. This restaurant is located in the heart of coconut grove in peacock garden. It has outdoor seating and indoor seating serving a gourmet menu that has plenty of options including a great surprise a god menu!! So it's outdoors with a family friendly environment  with slides and activities for the children, animal friendly with a puppy menu and amazing service and friendly professional staff. The manager Francesco was wonderful in his menu suggestions and accommodated all of our requirements as we were a vegan and vegetarian table. My puppy was over the moon in a place where he can eat at the same time as us and then play freely in the park. ,Simple outstanding a must visit!!"
"210 NE 18th St, Miami, FL 33132",8/5/2015,$$$,4,Mignonette,"Extensive menu focusing on seafood. They had 8 different types oysters to choose from. We opted for the chefs choice and they were excellent. The red fish was excellent as well for my main course. Although a seafood dominated menu, they were able to accommodate our vegan friend with the vegetable platter. Service was good, not great."
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/29/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"Glass & Vine is a great date spot. The outdoor seating at night presents a romantic ambience. There's lots of trees with twinkling lights and nice background music. As a vegetarian, the menu wasn't as impressive as the setting. Wish we had more options. I ordered the semolina pasta, which is the only main dish option that I had to choose from. I recommend adding a couple more vegetarian + vegan options to the menu to accommodate to all types of guests, because this place does have an amazing ambience."
"2820 Mcfarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/24/2018,$$,4,Glass & Vine,"2 la mulas and 1 gin blossom! De-lish- us!!! I came here on a Wednesday night for happy hour which is from 5-7p. Great vibe. It's an outdoor bar/ restaurant but they have ""indoor"" seating, but the entire restaurant is still an  open concept. They had a DJ playing tropical chill kind of music. Great to catch up with friends or a first day date (in my opinion at least)- not an intimate vibe but comfortable. The bartender was so sweet, unfortunately I didn't get her name- but everyone there is just so friendly. The chef even came to greet us and ask if we had any questions about the menu. A must try is the 'charred cauliflower' and the 'fried yuca'- it was so yummy I couldn't even take a picture of it! Sorry!! Very stand up place for the summer- it'd confidently give it a 5/5. Definitely would go back. Vegetarian friendly (vegan if you ask for no cheese)"
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The vibe is very intimate and cozy. The server was very attentive. My sister is a raw vegan and asked for a salad with a side of avocados but when she started eating the salad she noticed it had feta cheese. The server (Ricky, I think his name was) replace the salad right away with and gave her another side of avocados with no charge. He recommended the Penne Tetrazzini and it was delicious! I finally tried the Nutella filled French toast that I always see on Instagram and one word, AMAZING! ,Everything was great, next time I'll definitely come around to try their brunch!"
"3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135",1/3/2016,$$,5,Versailles Restaurant,Vegan Cubans: How wonderful el plato de viandas y vegetales! Yum - thanks for having it :)
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/4/2014,$$,4,Kush,"The selection of beer here is excellent, the staff is very knowledgable and go out of their way to make sure I have a great experience. The food, however is lacking in vegetarian/vegan options. All I can really eat there is the black bean burger, which is delicious, but I'd like to have more of a variety. I know they have a veggie meatball dish but the tomato soup they put it in is NOT veggie friendly. I made the mistake of ordering it and then being told they put beef broth in it. Whoever is in charge of that....vegetarians/vegans will not eat it because it has BEEF BROTH and meat eaters won't eat it because it doesn't have MEAT....think about it. ,Anyway, I definitely recommend this place to any beer aficionado or someone who enjoys some delicious treats. The cooks know what they're doing but PLEASE get more veggie options. I promise you will have more guests coming in."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/5/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Great hangover spot or great place to get a hangover! Excellent burgers and conch salad and the fries....to die for. A friend usually gets the vegan option and now they have salads but that isn't what I go there to eat.  They also make homemade honey mustard which is perfect to dip the fries in. The space is small so expect to wait or sit really close to others...Beer options are great, lots of local options and they always have a revolving selection too so ask your server what they recommend. I've never been disappointed with their choices."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/9/2016,$$,5,Kush,"I found this restaurant here on Yelp. We chose this restaurant first because of the location as we were taking photos with all the colorful walls wynwood has to offer. Second I am vegan so I always try to find a place that has some options for me as well as my meat eating friends. Third the ratings and reviews for this place are amazing, and i now know why. This resultant was not fancy but it was welcoming and fun.. Lots of beer to choose from..The food was over the top amazing. I got the black bean burger and sweet potato fries I had no complaints it was so good.. Others in the party had hamburgers and the gator tacos. The hamburgers, I'm told were cooked to perfection and the tacos were the best ever. I will recommend this place from now on and will definitely  be visiting again."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/2/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Friendly fast working staff and very knowledgable about the menu and beers they had on draft. So excited to Come back to cool environment. A must see place, the vibe is dope and so is the staff. The food was impeccable. I'm vegan and Sonnie my server was very accommodating. What a blast and good time Stephanie the bartender was as well. I'm not only really into food I also happen to be from newyork so having that attentive confident service was a A+ for me. Try there homemade hot sauce its the taste your craving. Literally writing this review on the way there again. See you there yelpers"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/23/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Their Vegan Jambalaya was spicy and all sorts of good!!!!  I would go there every day for that Jambalaya.  The free parking after 4 is extremely helpful too.  Went during a weekday, so the wait was not bad at all."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/28/2016,$$,5,Kush,"Such a spot! Cozy, friendly, fast service, awesome varieties of food and beer. If you are around, visit it. Also good for vegans. Ask for Jambalaya. Freaking awesome taste. Portion is right enough if you not super starving but local IPA will complicate it. ,Seasoning of food is crazy, spicy, rich on flavor... real comfort vegan food. No bs and sprouts. Quality is way better compare to other vegan places."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/29/2016,$$,3,Kush,"Sister was visiting home and chose to go here. We were a large party and they accommodated us quickly outside. They are known for their beer selection, but I didn't have any. I highly recommend the alligator bites... delicious! We also ordered the vegan jambalaya and the chicken and waffles. The jambalaya had a nice kick to it. I also tried the frita burger and it was yummy. Overall a good experience."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2015,$$,5,Kush,"Just a small jaunt from Wynwood areas, my friend and I hiked here during after seeing some amazing grafitti. Her, being a vegan, makes it a little more challenging to find a good food spot. Often times, servers won't know what vegan even means and would add or bring dairy. She called ahead to ask about a few specifics on the menu before our journey to a very helpful person. We arrived to a busy and smaller restuarant, our first good sign of what was to come! ( also appeared to be filled with hipsters mixed with business attire- clues to a good local spot! ) We sat on perimeter bar top. The decor, very urban sheik yet casual. Grafitti/ street art theme throughout. The had a nice selection of draft beers to start. The waitress was immediately pleasant and recognized/ made mention of my girlfriends call earlier. I decided on a burger, The Rita. Gueyre cheese, bacon, potato sticks and guava jelly on a perfectly cooked Patty. My mouth died and went to heaven! Yum. Loved the ""Kush"" burned into my bun top. My girlfriend did the black bean burger with guacamole and was equally  impressed. Just writing this I wanna go back! Try this place! It's great... You might have to squeeze in cause its busy, but for good reason!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/15/2015,$$,3,Kush,"Meh. Impressive beer selection, and I liked the sour brown I had, but food and service left a lot to be desired. I'm vegan, and I made that pretty clear when I asked about the challah bun, but then the lettuce-wrapped veggie burger came out with cheese, and our appetizer didn't come out at all. Server was totally nice, just busy and thus inattentive. ,The thing I liked most about the place was the bathroom door (see photo) and the fat that Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was playing on the TV."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/19/2014,$$,5,Kush,"I'd recommend the Johnny Utah, but I'm dying to get several other menu items. It's easily vegan friendly. Sides are all flavorful- asparagus is my favorite. There will absolutely be a beer on draft you'll love. ,They have quality... And variety of quality. ,It's always busy now, but worth it. Large portions, decent prices. First come first serve at the bar. A few picnic benches outside."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/31/2017,$$,5,Kush,"The vegan jambalaya is a revelation. Seriously, vegans and non-vegans alike will absolutely love it. Perfect flavor, just the right amount of spice and fills you up! Service is great and so is the ambiance. Definitely visiting Kush again anytime I'm in the Wynwood area!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",2/26/2017,$$,4,Kush,"Let's start with the positive..so last time my bf and I came here it was delicious we both left in heaven! This time, there was about a 45 minute wait and we were told to go 3 doors down to the right; there was a separate waiting room with games and drinks. As we enter, the vibe in this waiting room is cool, so we play Jenga. About 35 minutes later, we are seated and immediately order the Guac and chips! App came out super fast! Then for entree I ordered the vegan jambalaya and my bf ordered a burger; I didn't like my jambalaya..maybe it is because I don't eat meat and the texture was weird or there was too much? But my other half really enjoyed his burger. Dessert was excellent though, we had the jon dough with no ice cream. The manager went above and beyond to check and make sure the dessert was vegan and helped me out so much! Overall, we will be back, I just won't get that item. The food comes out really fast which is a plus! Also, everyone was really nice to us!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,As a vegan and going to a beer and Burger joint of course my choice is very limited but there is something for me.  I've ended up there many times with fiends and they love it and what if it was enjoyable. The beers are great and always come out satisfied
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/23/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Kush. We come here Wednesday night, after work,  two hours before closing, just lookin for some grub. We order: black bean burger and the vegan jambalaya, no drinks, just water. Service was great, food was great, and it wasn't too hot outside. Also highlight of our meal was when Blister in The Sun came on. What really bugged me and is making me write this review is what happened after we paid... ,Tipping is important. This is something I know well, because I'm also a server. I had a pretty great experience tonight, in fact, all of my experiences at kush have been great, but the attitude I received tonight made me super uncomfortable. I didn't have much cash on me, I had just enough to pay the bill, and a couple cents to tip. I had 3 measly dollars left in the bank and I thought to myself, well why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?,So I did it. ,waitress comes back to pick up receipts and change and walks away with a bitter look, TURNS AROUND to ask if there was something wrong with service to which we replied ""no"", and we looked really confused and shook and she actually looked down at the change, questioning it again and just walked away leaving us staring at each other in disbelief. Honestly just felt like such a degrading experience. She made us feel really bad about ourselves. I felt very judged and I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible to avoid the awkwardness she had created. A tip is a tip, right? we tried."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/30/2017,$$,5,Kush,Always great service and food. Have been multiple times with my boyfriend and to bring friends from out of town. Always a decent beer selection as well! Not only a place for meat eaters - great selection of vegetarian and vegans options. I always go for the alligator bites which is something cool to share with friends who don't live here. The menu is always changing but can definitely say I haven't had something I didn't like.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/22/2017,$$,5,Kush,"This place is awesome! Me and my husband have been here twice, this first time I ordered a salad and he ordered the chicken and waffles and gator bites! The salad was not a basic salad the lettuce and toppings were grilled and gave it an amazing flavor we both cleaned our plates.. and for Deseret we had the Brownie which was okay, but i wouldn't get it a second time and if I could recommend that they heat the growing up next time bc it was a very basic brownie lol. The second time I got a vegan jumbalya it was to die for!!! Even if you're not vegan you will love it! Even if you hate tofu which I do, you will love it in this dish! And my husband got a burger which he said was delicious. I eat more on the healthy side my husband not so much s going here there was options to satisfy both of us... OH! And the bathroom is define super cool! Check it out lol."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2017,$$,4,Kush,"As a non meat eater I'm obsessed with their vegan rice and seitan dish- amazing! Service is great, super dog friendly, just wish they had more space because wait times are usually pretty long!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",10/19/2017,$$,5,Kush,The black bean burger was amazing! We also has the vegan ice cream which is made locally and so creamy and delicious you would never even know it's dairy free. The atmosphere was very laos back with the music choice and that's 70's show playing there was plenty of vibes going on. I'll definitely be returning.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/12/2017,$$,4,Kush,I'm OBSESSED with the vegan jambalaya....wish they had more vegan options but even so I keep going back for the one dish they make that I can have! Love the beer selections. Cool vibes. Great location.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/2/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Farm to table... Great food, great atmosphere and they have a waiting room. The veggie burger is bar none. No pun intended.. this is a must visit.. veggie/vegan friendly.."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",3/12/2018,$$,5,Kush,This place is great! They actually had a vegan option on the menu which is rare for Miami! Keep it up!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/8/2017,$$,4,Kush,If you are in Miami this spot is a must ! The dishes are unique and there are plenty of vegan options that taste amazing. I split the burger with egg on a waffle and a vegan chicken parm. Missing a star because the side order of vegetables was very disappointing - only a few pieces of peppers.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/5/2017,$$,5,Kush,"Love everything about Kush, especially how the attentive and genuine wait staff happily suggest ways to make most of their entrees vegan or vegetarian friendly. Every time I've been, I've walked away blissful and full."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/9/2018,$$,5,Kush,Great vegan options!! I had their three vegan taco special and my husband had the vegan jambalaya. Both were fabulous.
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/10/2017,$$,3,Kush,"Perhaps I wont be able to do this place justice so very important disclaimer: *vegan palate*,So, I have come to this hole in the wall twice now and have gotten the same thing: the vegan cajun dish wish soy chorizo and rice. It sounds and reads amazing but the taste is unbearable! Too spicy! Very hard to eat and finish a dish when your mouth is on fire! If youre going to have a vegan dish perhaps make it edible by most. I know many people like a hard kick to their bite but damn not all people and not that hard. ,I still have hope for Kush and hope they start dishing out more vegan options, thanks for having one in the first place!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/2/2018,$$,5,Kush,Kush has to be one of my favorite spots in Miami  An amazing variety of beer options and the alligator tale app is to die for... if you dont order the alligator bites at Kush you haven't been to Kush! The Chicken and waffles are phenomenal! Let me tell you something about the Frito Pie.... ORDER IT! You won't regret it! If you're that person that's trying to get into the that vegan life.... Kush has great options for you too!!
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/6/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Whenever I want regular fries and sweet potato fries at the same time, this is the first spot I think of. Best veggie burgers in town and paired with fiddy fiddy fries, you can't go anywhere else for a great burger after that. The vegan jambalaya is my other favorite dish when I'm not in the mood for a burger. Great vegan options, great drinks & great vibe."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/30/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Cute place. Every detail is thought out and tied together perfectly. If you go during the day you can avoid more of the nighttime busyness. Outdoor seating, doggie menu for the fur babies, great service. In the heart of art in wynwood. Check it out, vegan jambalaya is delicious!"
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/13/2018,$$,5,Kush,"This was definitely the trendiest hole in the wall I have ever been to. Located in a really cool part of town in the art district (Wynwood), this is a spot I will come back to. The place was small, but could hold a good amount of people during a semi busy happy hour. We went for an early dinner, so there was plenty of room for 6 people at a table. I went with a healthy-ish vegetarian option - the vegan jambalaya. After a week of eating everything in sight, I was trying to be good. The dish was good, but I do wish I hadn't tried to be so good. Everyone's burgers looked so amazing. We will be sure to come back and visit the next time we are in town, maybe even check out the other spots by Lokal."
"2003 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",6/17/2018,$$,5,Kush,"Great food, great service,  fantastic folks. Very knowledgeable about beer selection. Everything on the menu is great including vegan options...psst don't forget to ask about off the menu items;) intimate setting, unique seating arrangement. Next door is the Botanica - room with craft beer for anytime or while you wait. Kush has one of the best CRAFT beer selections around ask my boy Caros at the bar, his recommendations are always on point. ,Chicken and waffles are a must, hobo frito pie and chicken skins are usually first for me. ,Highly recommended local TRUE miami spot."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/20/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"GreenStreet Cafe is a good crowd pleaser. They've got something for everyone, even someone who is vegan and gluten-free. There are enough items on the menu for a vegan who is also sans gluten not to feel too boxed in by limited options. We went for breakfast so this will color this review. The potatoes are fried in peanut oil so they're 'safe', The generous fruit plate and melon plates are also a good choice. The tomato, grits, oatmeal with cranberries or raisins and museli to the same tune were also lovely. They didn't have soy milk for the coffee (they normally do and their soy lattes are AMAZING!) but the coffee was still great. Omnivore friends said their eggs were ""perfect"". The omelete also seemed to please.The service was fast which is typical. We didn't have to wait for a table of 4 which per past experience is a little unusual. Everything was clean and done simply but well. I wouldn't go for myself but it's a good restaurant for groups with mixed dietary needs."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",3/10/2012,$$,4,Greenstreet Cafe,"I am in a hard place. Wahhh! This place was good but quite pricy. I wanna give 3/5 stars because of the pricing, but I think that's silly of me because touristy areas are not going to be cheeeeeap :3 I'macheapladymeep! ANYWAY, the food makes it worth a 4/5. I love that they give you some sort of spicy baresque peanut mixture before you get your food. Yum! Swallow that stuff up! I ordered a veggie pizza that was vegan (cheeseless :D) without having to ask. The hostess asked me!!! (Do you want cheese? Nay!) I was glad to have that option. ^.^ It was a really good sized pizza! Nice place... open late... yay & yay! : )"
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",8/15/2014,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"The best choice for a Grove sidewalk seat, we love this place.  Our cheerful server, Justin, was more than helpful with vegan modifications.  Fig salad - no cheese - perfect balance of flavors, not overdone.  As always, it was AWESOME."
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,We love Greenstreet! We come here every weekend for brunch. It's dog friendly and the food is great. We came here today to celebrate a birthday and we had the best time. Our server Andre was phenomenal. Always ready with a drink or menu recommendation and his quick wit. Both vegans and meat lovers were happy. Come see for yourself!
"3468 Main Hwy, Miami, FL 33133",5/11/2017,$$,5,Greenstreet Cafe,"I always enjoyed this place before becoming vegan. Since going back, I really enjoyed their oatmeal (one of the best I've had). I had side of the potatoes, which have always been my favorite!! And a bowl of fruit, which were all fresh and delicious. If you're vegan, I wouldn't worry too much. They have more of a selection than other places and it's good quality."
"1035 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33136",6/12/2018,$$,5,Fooq’s,Beautiful rustic French restaurant. A small shop that can allows everyone to be a little bit more intimate. Service was great the waitress really knew her stuff. Food came out in a timely manner. Wine list has depth to it (I mean it's a French restaurant) I ordered a vegan entree I believe it's called seasonal vegetable tahdig and my girlfriend ordered the Fooq's burger very flavorful. Overall great wait to end the night.
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",8/25/2015,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wow! This place is awesome. I came for a birthday dinner with my girls. Each of us with some weird eating habit. 1 vegan, 1 gluten free, and 1 allergic to fish. This place was able to cater to ALL 3. This is what we all ordered and loved it!!!!! Vegan - Fried corn with no butter; portobello mushroom sandwich with extra chips and avocado, and lychee sangria. Gluten Free - Lemonade, baked bbq chicken with veggies. No Fish - BBQ Pork Burritos, sangria and key lime pie. We were stuffed and so happy. BUT, the best part was our waiter KIAH!!! Once he heard about our weird habits, he confirmed with the chef at the start of the meal what we could all eat. And if he didn't know then we made sure to find out. He was so funny and personable. He didn't try to pretend to know the menu, he really knew it and would ask questions if he didn't. We didn't feel neglected or bombarded. If you have a chance then take a seat with KIAH!!! I will definitely come back"
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",5/9/2016,$$,4,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Delicious comfort food, without the pretentiousness of many restaurants of this level. My compliments to the chef, who made every effort to accommodate my daughter's newly adopted vegan lifestyle. The service was good, actually really good. We were a party of 10, and everything came out at a reasonable time. This place is always packed, and worth the wait. The pan roasted Brussels sprouts are amazing with that green goddess dressing. Don't miss the fried green tomatoes and the fried chicken."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",7/9/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Away from the beaten path yet accessible from Sunset Drive and Red Road quietly sits Whisk Gourmet Good and Catering in South Miami. Fun restaurant with reasonable prices (not ""gourmet"" prices). First we were greeted by a warm woman whose smile was contagious, handing us a bowl with 2 homemade lemon poppy muffins (freshly made, moist, not too sweet which is a biggie for me and a hint of lemon, perfect), our server was a friendly gentleman who was always mindful without being intrusive. Our food was spectacular AND Frank X. Pulles had his favorite,  Low Country Shrimp and Gritts. Coffee was beyond exceptional and the OJ tasted fresh squeezed.  Yum. Starting TONIGHT I go back to my Vegan foods, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT."
"7382 SW 56th Ave, Miami, FL 33143",11/1/2017,$$,5,WHISK Gourmet Food & Catering,"Wowwww. The salads here are to die for. Such fresh and clean food. Felt so healthy. They have a lot of gluten and vegan free options which is good. The fried green tomato was just perfect. The salad portions were decent. The creamy corn was actually my favorite. I thought everything at this place was great. The service was good, and the waiters were nice. Definitely recommend"
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",9/22/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere and open kitchen. Service was great too. We had a rice pot (vegetarian not vegan) and it was delicious and big. It was packed on a Thursday for lunch, so best get reservation."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",8/29/2016,$$$,4,KYU,"From the subtle side salad to the colorful drinks, this place knows FLAVOR. As a vegan, I was able to choose a few items from the menu. It is extremely pricey and the portions are not that big, but the atmosphere is amazing and super trendy. The waiter knew his stuff and was very helpful."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",12/4/2016,$$$,5,KYU,"The ribs will turn a vegan into a carnivore.  Umami to the max.  Crunchy and perfectly cooked, no disgusting gristle bits... divine.  Even typing this review, one day after the meal, I'm salivating. I'm from Manhattan, and I am a bit of a food snob...so you can trust me.  This place is beyond.   You know those crappy wooden popsicle stick chopsticks that make you cringe with horror as they brush against your teeth with every bite?  Not here! The chopsticks match the atmosphere: streamlined, modern, and well designed.  Well worth the price $$$.  The cauliflower is crunchy and has a delicious creamy but light sauce underneath it.  The tomatoes with olive oil have the perfect flavor of the olive oil.  You can taste the quality and the creativity.  Hop on a scooter, or into a fiat, or onto a graffitied car, and get over to KYU as fast as possible."

I especially love their roasted cauliflower and kale. Mmmmm! I recently organized my cousin's bday dinner there with a large group and the staff was always on top of things."
"251 NW 25th St, Miami, FL 33127",6/25/2018,$$$,5,KYU,Love this place! Make sure to call early to get a reservation but the food is awesomeness. Good vegan options as well for your non meat eaters.
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/2/2016,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"One of the best meals I have had in months. This was a spectacular dining experience! Every dish was beautifully prepared and presented.  The flavors, presentation and variety in the menu satisfied our party of diverse eaters. I eat vegetarian and vegan and there were many options and everyone loved them. The ricotta, figs, beets was outstanding, the cauliflower, pumpkin gnocchi incredible with a balanced wine list and a great value. Its worth stopping in to try if you are in Miami."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",4/28/2017,$$,3,Beaker & Gray,"I feel like this place could be so much better if they catered to others who have specific dietary needs. Out of all of the food that was available in the menu, I found it really lacked in terms of vegan and vegetarian options. I was only able to eat one thing out of the entire menu that had well over 20 things and I found that to be disappointing.  On top of that, the place was ridiculously overpriced for food that wasn't quite filling. ,I highly recommend that if you want to come here, you come purely for their drinks as that seemed to be the only thing that I really enjoyed out of this entire experience. ,Also, even though our server was willingly trying to be attentive to my dietary needs, he still ended up messing up my order for when I asked for specific things to be taken out of one of the things in the menu that I ordered. This was the cauliflower that came with bacon and the fact that not even that tasked could be done, made me reluctant to ever return. ,You'd think that this place would be more up and coming and cater to everyone as it's Wynwood but it wasn't. ,However, my mom and my boyfriend enjoyed their meals and I really liked the ambience of the place since it brought something romantic so it's great if you have the money to spend on an expensive date or a place to go with family that came from out of town."
"2637 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/2/2018,$$,5,Beaker & Gray,"What a great place to bring a large group of people too. We were eight people and we sat in this large booth. The cocktails were amazing and there was a variety of food options for all the dietary restrictions in the family (vegan, among them). The service was also very great. I find that sometimes big groups get ignored, but our waitress was very attentive."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",5/21/2015,$$,3,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"They should add a few vegan options. They do have some vegetarian though. However, they were very accommodating and ""veganized"" their dishes."
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",9/3/2016,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,Simply amazing and right next to Wynwood Walls. This is a must see place! I'm a vegan and they had a lot of options. My favorite was the flash fried bok choy! My husband is a meat eater and said the 48 hour pork belly was the best pork he's ever eaten
"2550 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/28/2018,$$,5,Wynwood Kitchen & Bar,"Regardless of what cuisine you're into - meat lovers to vegans - this place has it all. I've never had a dish that isn't excellent. It's too good! Excellent service, conveniently located next to the Walls."
"2320 Salzedo St, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/5/2017,$$$,5,Ruth’s Chris Steak House,"I've always had a good experience at Ruth's Chris. I come here with my family about once or twice a year, and the food has yet to disappoint. The chefs really know how to prepare the dishes, and the servers are very professional and polite. The menu has a pretty good variety of options, and the servers and chefs are also very accommodating if you ask for vegetarian or vegan options. There aren't many vegan or vegetarian options on the menu, but the server will accommodate any dietary needs and take ingredients out of certain dishes, if asked.  Again, the service is always fantastic. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Coral Gables. I love the location-right off Miracle Mile-and I can't wait to go back. After my meal, I usually like to visit Books & Books or the art cinema located on the same street, just a minute walk away! There's valet, street, and garage parking. Reservations are necessary."

You'll be six, or maybe nine. Four will be on time, one a little late, someone else very late, and oops! The babysitter flaked out, so now there's a last minute +1 or 2 little ones. And your best friend is vegan, and you don't like seafood. Four of 6 people are gluten-free, 1 doesn't drink alcohol, 3 of you can't tolerate spice, and somebody's an ovo/lacto vegetarian. To put it bluntly, your group is an absolute hot-mess, server's NIGHTMARE! Fear not. Mina's can handle it.,Step 1: Refer to the box on the top left of the menu and order the ""dips"" as a shared appetizer. You can get a variety of yummy, healthy snacks like hummus and tzatziki. They come with homemade pita bread, but you can ask for a couple of orders of Crudités for the gluten-frees. And the menu includes a couple of really tasty vegetarian entrées, there's a delicious homemade lemonade for tea-totalers, there's an amazing dish of mussels to share, and the wines are priced right by the glass or the bottle. NO NEED TO GET YOUR PRIVILEGE IN A BUNCH! The server has seemingly unlimited patience and professionalism. He will listen to your long list of special needs and make helpful suggestions without batting an eye. He almost seems to care that oregano gives Tiffany hives and wheat makes Brandi's belly bloat. Not only that, but he's happy to stand up on a chair to take the perfect group photo for the obligatory FaceBook post.,Step 2: Sit back and enjoy your special evening. The food is great, the service even better, and the space is beautiful. High ceilings and comfy seats. There's enough space between the tables to chat and toast and laugh without disturbing anyone. You'll actually relax and have a great time!,One last note: Mina's has ample free parking in a private lot behind the restaurant. No drama, even on a Saturday night."

My BF who is Vegan had an Eggplant dish that was also great. I would had given it a 5 except that I was looking for more info on the food I was eating,  an explanation on what the food was and how to eat it. It was my first time eating Egyptian food and didn't know how to put it all together. I will Def go again."

"749 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/13/2017,$$,4,Mina’s Mediterraneo,"Went here for dinner with my wonderfully picky partner. I loved the ambience of the place. And while the service was slow and the server not too knowledgeable about vegan choices the meal (Vegan Moussaka) was very good...better than my partners vegetarian meal. Using Yelp also allowed me a free dish of hummus, which was hummuslicious."

I would typically respond with a ""hell no, only my husband would eat vegan food"" except today ...today I ate my words ..no pun intended  this amazing restaurant was delish! I am not a vegan I repeat , I do not go for vegan food but Amsterdam falafelshop is the bomb!!! Friendly customer service beyond exceptional and  the food is so tasty you will not realize you're eating healthy ! I'm so glad We drove from Florida City all the way here to give it a try . I would most definitely be back and believe me when I tell you I would so recommend this place to others!"

"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",10/4/2017,$$,3,Craftsman,"I tried out this spot, seeing it was under hot and new. I am a vegetarian and got excited to see the that there is a whole section on avocado on the menu. First, basically everything under the avocado side sounds like the same thing besides the avocado halves and the wrap. I decided to try out the vegan pizza, which I honestly thought would be more creative than just a regular avocado toast. Also wasn't to tasty. On the up side great, friendly service."
"12131 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33156",2/20/2017,$,5,Daily Bread,"Grew up in Miami as a vegetarian and then vegan in the '90s/early 2000s, near this location. This place was a staple not just because they had veg options, but they're awesome. Pretty much all my Miami friends love this place, and most aren't vegan/vegetarian. Best falafel sandwiches, hands down. I've been in NYC for 13 years now, and this place is still my favorite falafel joint."

The music, the colors, and the always smiling welcoming girls. They have a variety of healthy food options and smoothies; also smoothie bowls, healthy desserts and coffee. They have gluten free options, sugar-free options and the best part, vegetarian and vegan options, so you can pretty much customize the order to your liking or dietary needs. Also they have healthy meal plans and delivery whatmote can you ask? My particular favorite items of the menu are the acai protein bowl, the cleansing green juice, the superfood salad with oven roasted tofu, the chicken salad arepa and the summer fresh bowl  highly recommend it! And if you can't make it, you can always order online for the food to be delivered! By far the best healthy fresh food place in doral"
"7299 NW 36th St, Miami, FL 33166",10/19/2017,$$,5,Delirio Fresh Co Express,"Ordered the Superfood Salad and made it vegan by substituting the cheese for another veggie at no extra cost. It was delicious and the quantity was more than enough. The staff was very nice, the place is brand new and really clean. Overall an excellent experience for lunch, as it was quick also. Will be coming back weekly."
"7299 NW 36th St, Miami, FL 33166",10/7/2017,$$,5,Delirio Fresh Co Express,"So glad they opened a new one closer to my house, everything's so healthy and delicious, you will notice they use fresh ingredients. So many options on the menu, plus you can also make everything your way. The second you enter you feel a good vibe around, everyone's really nice and attentive. They offer a different and original side of healthy food, if you're vegan/veggie this is also the place to go. My favorite items on the menu are the Superfood Salad, lentil soup and Acai Bowl. You must try these!"

I love falafels, and the way they have the food set up is clean, organized and very delicious! I'm neither vegan nor vegetarian, and this place did not fail to satisfy my very choosy tastebuds. I chose a bowl, and I put all of my favorite veggies and things in it. They have a great variety of sauces to choose from, and I tried ALL of them. I also liked that you can have as much hummus as you'd like, it's included in the price. The fries are amazing too, and the bay leaf powder they put made them taste perfectly seasoned. The service was great as well, they made excellent recommendations and were really friendly. I'm so happy I ran into this place. I will definitely be coming back!"
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",3/31/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"A nice surprise! I was really craving Mediterranean and all the places around work are a bit over priced and nothing out of the ordinary. Decided to give it a try and ordered postmates. I got the falafel bowl for$7 including the (small cart fee) it was delicious. The pickled beets, cauliflower and hummus were delicious. The sauces as well had a nice combination of creamy and spices that I absolutely loved. I didn't think this place was going to be all that but it is vegan paradise! Highly recommend !"
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",10/22/2017,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Hottest new vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurant on the block. Located in the Sunset Place Mall area, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat if you're looking for something healthy and not too expensive. ,The menu is a little small, since they only sell sandwiches, bowls, fries, brownies, and other variations of the sort with different sizes, but it's all very simple and easy to make. ,There is also delivery available, but from what I've heard it's not yet available through the Yelp app, though it's on its way (I think Postmates and Grubhub have it up though). They also don't do call deliveries because they do not take credit card information over the phone, so it's all mobile through the food delivery apps. ,The restaurant itself is clean and comfortably small. I liked the service and my falafel sandwich was made fresh and quick. You can also add on many different toppings without extra fee. My regular falafel sandwich was about $7. ,The peanut sauce is the best! Delicious sauce to put on your meal, I don't know why I only recently discovered it. I also enjoyed the hummus, jalapeño sauce, and red pepper sauce. ,Definitely a new hot spot for all types of foodies in South Miami, accommodating to many dietary needs."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",11/12/2017,$,4,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Looking for a quick bite and Walked into this shop on my way to work. I ordered a Falafel bowl it comes with 5 falafels and you can add any topping as long as it fits the container. The falafels and toppings are tasty, it's an amazing variety of toppings that you see quite a few things that you normally won't seen in other similar shops, such as fried eggplant, pickled cauliflower etc.  Good place to go for vegans, and someone who is looking for a fast service."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",4/1/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Went here for a quick snack before catching a movie at Sunset.  Not only was it so quick to buy but omg it was so fresh!  They had so many vegan options for toppings and you could taste that it was all homemade.,I hope this spot is around for a long time. ,Step in for some delicious falafels with such a variation of toppings that you could really have a whole different meal experience every time.,They serve it in a bowl for those trying to skip the carbs too."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",7/19/2018,$,3,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Came to this vegan falafelshop to catch some lunch before I went to work.  Ordered pick up with postmates.  I noticed the menu was so limited and then realized they really only serve falafel (I know what the place is called just thought they would have more options).  ,I ordered for pick up.  Parking is eh since it is sunset place.  I parked in the garage that was next to where Ra used to be.  I walked to the restaurant which the distance wasn't bad at all.  Just crossing the street can be a bit much with traffic.  Made my way to the place which was easily spotted from the street.  ,I ordered and a lot of the items that I put into my bowl I had no idea what it was going to taste like.  I went on pure gut and prayed it would be good.  Honestly it was.  It tasted great.  The falafel was covered with a lot of sauces and hummus and it never became soft.  The falafel kept its crispiness which was surprising because usually with too much sauce the falafel gets soggy.  Not in this case!,When I arrived I noticed that all the items that I put onto my bowl are nicely arranged like a salad bar at the actual restaurant.  I am pretty sure if I would of dined in my experience would of been much better but since I didn't know what I was getting myself into I was conservative in my order.  My complaint about this place is that there really aren't more options for non vegan eaters however it is great for people who are vegan.  ,I will return to try this place again however I will probably dine in instead of ordering out."
"5835 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",2/4/2018,$,5,Amsterdam Falafelshop,"Awesome place!  In search of a vegan option for my,nephew's birthday, I found this place.  I'm not vegan but he is so I needed a compromise. Came here for lunch with my nephew and three kids and it was delicious. Place is small and very casual. Nice decor and clean. You have the option to get the falafel in a pita (white or wheat) or a bowl. We ordered three small pitas, two small bowls, and three large fries. ,At first I was a little concerned because the bowls look small (my kids eat), but we could hardly finish everything. The fries were definitely a lot (we ordered three and took two home), but they were so good. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They sprinkle salt and seasoning if you want. They also have a few different sauces to add to your falafel or fries such as tahini, creamy garlic mayo, curry ketchup, ketchup, and a few others that I can't remember. ,Once your order is ready you can top your sandwich or bowl with numerous toppings that are available. It's self serve so you can add as much as you want, but only once. Meaning you can't start eating your sandwich and decide you want more of a specific topping.  They have quite a selection of toppings which I can't remember them all but some are cucumber and onions, baba ganoush, hummus, pickles, cabbage, chick peas, cabbage, a garlicky parsley thing that was delicious and a bunch others.  Oh and the falafels have a nice delicious flavor.  ,Price was decent...for two small bowls, three small sandwiches, 3 large fries and 5 drinks we spent about $65.00. Definitely would be back."
"339 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/29/2016,$$$,3,Bellmont Spanish Restaurant,"Ordered the vegetarian paella, and turned out to be made with fish broth, which was not disclosed. So, if you're vegetarian or vegan this is not the place for you as it is the only vegetarian entry on the menu. Otherwise, the pork croquettes were quite good, and so were the wines from Spain."
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",5/10/2018,$,4,Spice N Curry,"Spice N Curry is an Indian Grocery Store that also serves cooked Indian food from its small cafe in the back.. but from the looks of it, you wouldn't know that they serve food. The cooked food is the reason I've been coming here for the last few years. It's located in one of my favorite strip malls that also includes Vegan & Juice and Chinese Guy.,The food here is very tasty and authentic and the portions are generous. They have a small menu which includes items such as samosas, naan, and some other items that I have been offered as samples. The server here is friendly and always willing to conversate. My favorite entree is their Goat Biryani which is large enough for 2 meals.,The other day I discovered some fresh squeezed Indian bitter-melon juice in a green bottle in their fridge for only $5.99.. another reason to come here. The best way to describe this is nature's medicine and it's said to fight cancer, treat diabetes, regulate blood sugar, and treat a host of other common and/or serious conditions. All I know is that it's super healthy, but most people won't like the taste.. it tastes fine to me. You just take a shot of it each day (and don't overdo it because too much of anything can be bad for you) and the bottle lasts for about a week."

They have a small cafeteria in the back of a grocery store and about 12 people can fit on their counters and wait to be fed deliciousness. Their meal combos range from $7 to $9, and i normally get their vegan option. I leave w leftovers all the time. Do yourself a favor and visit this hidden gem!"
"123 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/28/2017,$,5,Spice N Curry,"A plus plus all around!! I'm recently vegan and this place offered such a good variety of flavor - all in one dish! I ordered the vegan curry and was surprised at how much food I was given (I couldn't even finish, so I took some home). The meal includes rice and a salsa on the rice, two lentils, naan, and another hard bread (sorry I'm not too familiar with the food names) and a drink, all for $8! This is definitely another hidden gem in Miami. Side note - the home made vegan turmeric cookies are amazing too!"

"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",4/22/2014,$$,3,Pincho Factory,"Came to Pincho Factory for lunch only to experience they were having maintenance issues and would be opening two hours after scheduled time. I was bummed about it and just headed over to Sarussi that is located on the same shopping strip. After lunch and on my way to the car, we notice Pincho Factory is indeed open so we head in at least for dessert. The minute we walked in, I smelled burger juice...like the grease. Maybe it's because my husband is vegan and I've been turned off of meat a little but no lie the smell did slightly gross me out. ,For dessert, there were two options- an Oreo Pie and a Nutella Smore's Pie and they are provided by Sweetness Bake Shop. By the sounds of it, the Nutella would have been my choice but I'm glad we got one of each because the Oreo ended up being the better of the two. Although it didn't blow me away, it was alright- It must have been tucked away in the coldest part of the fridge cause it was a little hard and mega cold on my teeth. ,Hoping I can come back to Pincho Factory soon to update my rating and actually judge them by their own food and not that of their bakeshop."
"9860 SW 40th St, Olympia Heights, FL 33165",3/30/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"This is a place that surprised me. A pincho is meat on a stick so I originally expected just that. Secondly I expected typical greasy, bland tasting fast food. The kind that requires mayo, mustard and ketchup for moisture and taste. But I was delighted to find great flavors and interesting meals. This is fast food taken to the next level. The flavorful level. It's as if someone opened a fast food restaurant but had training at French Cordon Blue. In fact, the only typical ""fast food"" about this place is the furniture. My daughter raves about the burgers especially the toston burger. Which is a feat in itself to make it tasty and to keep it's shape. She licks her fingers every time. There is also a vegan burger that I hear converts people. I am trying all the bowls one by one, having difficulty choosing one. They offer fresco, california, tex-mex, latin, chimichurri, Mediterranean style of bowls, salads and wraps with four choices of delicious proteins. But DO NOT expect anything typical. So far Im favoring the cali because of the mandarins, almonds, gorgonzola cheese and mango sauce.  Omggggg. And the portions are so generous. You will not leave hungry. You can also get hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. Apparently they have award winning fries, and yuppppp: pinchos!!! And a surprisingly great selection of beers and IPAs. I keep telling myself I'm going to get a pincho one day but then I walk in and see the menu and there's just too many great choices. I have a feeling though that they too are probably delicious. The only item I considered just ok were the sweet potato taters. But I am a huge sweet potato lover who believes it should be paired with salt not sweet. And you gotta give them some area to grow. Lol. Also Im always crazy full by the time I get to the taters. So yeah. That."

I came by to check it out yesterday and a gentleman by the name of Leo attended us. We just came for coffee. It was our first time so he made me a customer favorite but w Almond Milk. The consistency was amazing for it being made with Almond instead of regular. It was too sweet for my taste (I eat Vegan low sugar,low salt etc... so my taste buds are very sensitive to anything that is flavored, and has sugar.. I would probably come back to have this as a dessert. It seems like something perfect for those ""cold"" days in Miami...if we even get any this year, lol. The ambiance/decor wasn't something I liked; it reminded me of one of those places you visit in Orlando. Like a replica building or something cheesy so we left quickly. Other than that honest opinion, we appreciate the warm welcome from your staff and decided to write a review. Thumbs are up!"

"65 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/7/2015,$$,5,Tarpon Bend,"Brunch review: probably one of the most delicious brunches I've had in a while. First any place with bottomless mimosas, bloodies and other drinks already is a thumbs up for me. Not only is it bottomless but you can also switch around your drink so you don't get tired of drinking the same thing. I had the vegan and omg it was so delicious I forgot it was actually healthy. Highly recommend this option even if you are not trying to be healthy it's so well made you won't even notice. Definitely coming back for brunch again."
"65 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/29/2017,$$,5,Tarpon Bend,"I came here for a charity brunch and was hesitant about their vegan + Gluten Free options. The staff was incredibly accommodating and made something special for me to eat. They made two chickpea veggie parties with an avocado creama (made with coconut milk), arugula salad and diced grilled potatoes with onions. Insanely delicious! I told them they need to have this back on the menu for other who suffer from food allergies like,I do! I was so impressed with how accommodating they were and didn't just tell me to eat a salad like most restaurants do. I will definitely recommend and come back in the future! Bravo!"

The owner is very sweet and attentive. The location is cute and nicely decorated. I heard the owner used to have a cupcake shop. I wonder if she'll ever open a vegan bakery now that this business is thriving."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/14/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan but ran into this place and decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Dragon Bowl & Avocado Toast. The Dragon Bowl was amazing! Filling, refreshing & pretty lol! The avocado toast was good too, just too much avocado for me, but this seems like it should actually be a pro."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/28/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Even though I'm not a vegan, Roots is still one of my favorite lunch/breakfast go-to places in Miami. So if you're holding back on coming because you aren't vegan either, DONT! They're food is super great for everyone and their Fruit bowls and smoothies are the best thing to have on a hot Miami day. My best friend is vegan so it's nice to have a place near the area we can both go to enjoy. Wish they had more places down here like this one!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Super fun and friendly staff + absolutely delicious vegan food. The juices are also fantastic, not too sweet, yet aromatic and flavorful. Perfect!"

Although I am not vegan, I'm in love with this place. I can only afford to spend 9 bucks on a juice smoothie once every other week, but I have always enjoyed those smoothies up until the last slurp. :)"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/5/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,ordered the Kansas city burnt tips which were so finger licking good with loaded fries that made me do the happy dance. I also ordered the wood bone wings which wasn't for me. 2 minutes away from my house so definitely will be trying out more. Way better than other vegan options in the area.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/18/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Hands down best vegan burgers and food EVER. Forget the overrated, overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. Atlas has the most flavorful foods, it all tastes different. Best part? GREAT, if not perfect customer service, it's usually quite busy, but you barely have to wait for your food."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/19/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,SOOOOOOOO GOOD. Staff is friendly and the food is ridiculous. If there was more vegan food like this everyone would be down.
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/27/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I ended up trying this place since I've been to a few local restaurants offering their products. I love how chill and relaxed the food truck is, it's very reminiscent of the Wynwood Yard! Plenty of parking in adjacent streets. I got the burger, which was okay! But my goodness are those loaded fries delicious!!! It's definitely vegan junk food at it's best."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/2/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,The best. Perfect location & delicious food. Friendly staff. Can't wait for their extended hours to start & hopefully for them to open on mondays. The chkn sandwich is my favorite & they also provide the meat for the vegan jambalaya at kush which is also great! Thank you for existing

GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT SERVICE AND THE BEST OF ALL THEY ARE THE BEST VEGAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN!!!!!! Literally no one cant compete. This was my first vegan food i ever tried. I had the burnt tips sandwich with fries. Oh man let me tell you i never tasted something like this. This literally turn me out to eat healthier and search healthier alternatives. You guys changed my lifestyle!"

It was a little difficult to find at first but once we did, we were amazed how crowded the small area was that housed the food truck. All of the items on the menu were vegan. We ordered the Rachael on Rye, the Island Patty Melt and an order of the loaded fries. All were thoroughly enjoyed! We will definitely be coming back!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/6/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Great vegan food, great set up! Try their burgers and their fries are amazing! Expect to pay over $10 if you want more than a burger. They are friendly as well. The only downfall is the parking...but Im not knocking a star for that! Either you find free parking around or you pay for parking on 79th street. I highly recommend it."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/14/2016,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Delicious ! Delicious!  I had the nachos and the "" le bleu""   Sandwich and I was in vegan heaven! Highly recommend"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/22/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is awesome!! I heard about Atlas from a vendor at the Yellow Green Market (also amazing). Shortly after I saw a Groupon and immediately purchased it. I brought my carnivorous husband who usually hates vegan food and we both loved our homestyle vegan sandwiches. I got the buttermilk chicken which was the best vegan chicken I have ever had with waffle fries, ""cheese"" sauce, and a root beer. My husband got the tips  sandwich, which I tried but honestly tasted too much like meat to me and freaked me out, so there really is something for every type of vegan here. Vegans who don't like meat and want something delicious, and vegans who miss the taste of meat. The setting was adorable and the vegan community around was wonderful, it was great to talk to other people with a similar frame of mind when it comes to diet. The guy who took our order was wonderful, super friendly, best customer service I've ever had in Miami. This was such a treat. There are other vegan places I'm honestly not crazy about and this was just a great experience with amazing food."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2012,$,4,La Latina,"This place is super cute!  It is a small, unassuming place on the outside, but very warm, friendly and inviting on the inside! They use gluten free products and meat without any hormones, etc. and they are starting to serve vegan mini cupcakes from Bunnie's.  ,Hubs and I tried a variety of things - Pabellon empanada, cheese & sweet plantains empanada, the Reina Pepeida and the Pelua arepas.  My favorite was the Reina Pepeida arepa.  It's seriously filled to the brim with a creamy chicken salad (creamy from the avocado - heavenly!),The decor is like you stepped into your Abuela's (grandma!) house and you're plopping down at the kitchen table for an afternoon snack.  ,Tasty, cheap and fun."
"5241 NW 87th Ave, Doral, FL 33178",6/10/2018,$$,4,Dragonfly Izakaya & Fish Market,"Japanese restaurant with Yummy appetizers! We ordered several and they were all great. My friend is a Vegan and she found delicious options. The tempura mushrooms as well as the shrimps were wonderful.,The strip steak was excellent and the broccoli appetizer as well.,The exotic cocktails were deelish. I had the Sake-like cocktail and my friend the whiskey-inspired cocktail. Everything was wonderful and the setting and decor are really nice.,DORAL is coming around and places like Dragonfly are helping it get there.,The waiter was a delight with helpful suggestions that were right on the mark. ,Young guy with a beard and a great personality to boot.,Nice place, Dragonfly!"
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/22/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We LOVE this place. The arepas are INCREDIBLE; it's fast, so cheap, AND they catered a big party for us and were extremely professional / organized / on-time. They even have a vegan/vegetarian menu (although, it's kind of lost on me.) They don't skimp on the meat/cheese and the sauces are OUT of this world."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",11/1/2017,$,5,La Latina,"We came here after the House of Roots kava bar. Although small, don't let it fool you, this place makes incredible arepas for various eaters from vegan to your average meat eater. My boyfriend had the beef arepa as did his friend. This was a nice stop along way before heading over to the Secret Garden Halloween party. I ordered the cheese and avocado arepa. It was so fresh and just mouth watering. We also shared the cheese sticks that his friend ordered. ,I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area even though I'm not a fan of where the restaurant actually is. We didn't have a hard time parking but it's in an area where cars are zooming past and since its Miami, of course, certain drivers can be a bit reckless from time to time. It also didn't help that it was raining like crazy. ,The decorations of this place are gorgeous. It reminded me of what it was like back when I visited Mexico. The colors were pastel and beige. Everything just blended in so nicely. ,I highly recommend bringing a date, a friend, or even a small group before going out or even during the day when it's nice and sunny since it'll be better. There's also a brewery around the corner where you can get a drink after enjoying the delicacies of some avant garde arepas."
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/13/2018,$,5,La Latina,"This place is a hidden gem. I ordered the bean and avocado arepa and it was delicious. They have vegan options available. The place itself it's interesting, they have cute old fashion hispanic decorations that takes me back to my cuban childhood."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/31/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I am so glad I finally got to try this place. My only regret is not trying it sooner. I ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend (non vegan) ordered the burger. Both were delicious and she was surprised at how good the taste was. The fries were crisp and well seasoned and I even ordered from their deli some cheese so I can have some at home. Definitely check it out, especially if you do eat meat. It will shock you."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"What a neat spot with amazing food!!! Vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters alike will walk away satisfied. The staff members and the owner are so friendly too and are happy to make recommendations. Be sure to finish your meal with a hyppo flavored ice pop. I wish there were more spots like this in Miami."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Once a year my entire family turns vegan for my brothers birthday. This is the spot he chose this year. He has frequented this spot. I have to say the services are part of what makes this place so great. We are a party of 12 and they definitely exceed their service expectations all the while being very busy as many people are coming in to pick up to go orders or place to go orders. The person in the front taking the orders (forgot name) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I wouldn't doubt if he is an owner and if he isn't, owners should know they have hired real talent. He took the time to explain the scientific process of how their products are made and was able to answer everyone's questions. He let us know what their specialties are and recommendations. Food was good. Ordered probably one of everything being that we have such a large party LOL. I recommend the mac & cheese, waffle fries, burnt barbecue tips, and burger. If you are a Vegan or just want to try some good vegan comfort food I recommend this spot. For me I have to say what made it so great was definitely the friendly and knowledgeable service. I hope that this will continue as they expand or move to a permanent location. Only reason why I couldn't give it five stars is because there is no bathroom. It appears that most people go for a quick bite or get food to go. It's almost like a food truck that's there permanently. However there is space for them to at least put a porta potty. So if you plan to eat there and don't live in the area make sure you scope out nearby public restrooms beforehand."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,I've made this my go to Friday spot. My son and I have tried several dishes and they all are delicious. We tried the island Mac n cheese. My son loved it. He also had burger - *consensual meat of course*  I had the island patty melt. Last week I got the meatball with waffle fries and we had a float with vegan ice cream. You gotta try this place. The Two guys that operate the food truck are very pleasant and professional. Maybe I'll see you there one Friday  - Enjoy
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/6/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Delicious vegan food - just a bit tricky to find. I was visiting family in Miami and knew I wanted to make a trip here. My carnivore father enjoyed the food and service even more than my vegan self! They truly are making vegan food for carnivores here haha.

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/1/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I had the meat free burger and vegan mac and cheese, and I was blown away! That mac and cheese was one of the best and it wasn't ""real"" cheese. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/18/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is amazing! Everyone is always super nice, and the food is soooo Delicious!! It's a little far away from me, so I make sure to order something when I head up north.  It's usually just a 15-20 minute detour, so definitely worth it! I have brought many omnis here, and they all love it, too.  My favorite item is the Kansas City Burnt Tip sandwich.  Tip: if you want it to go, order and pay online.  Whether you're vegan or not, try Atlas, you won't be disappointed.  :)"

To my surprise they opened shop here at the Wynwood Yard. Whether vegan, cheagan, vegetarian or a meat eater you WILL enjoy eating here. I had the BIG Mac'n (it came with some fries), my partner the Kansas City Tips and the chili cheese fries. All 5/5 and pictured for your visual pleasure. ,I know Della Bowls (also in at the Wynwood Yard) is noteworthy and delicious BUT do go visit their new neighbor Atlas. Your taste buds will thank you and so will your animal friends."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/27/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Probably my new favorite Vegan spot in Miami! The burnt tips are a must. Unfortunately, when I got there they were out of cheese sauce so get there early! I will definitely be back soon."

Atlas serves up sandwiches that gives some of the nearby traditional sandwich spots a run for their money. ,Food:,Le Bleu ($11) is the more popular sandwich at this vegan spot: grilled portobello, garlic aioli sauce, a 'bleu' cheese & 'steak sauce', finished with caramelized onions. ,#GoVegan"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/2/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I tried atlas with a Groupon. It is a food truck that serves vegan sandwiches that mimic classic meat sandwiches. As a vegan, I was excited to indulge in the fried chicken sandwich. It was pretty good but didn't blow me away. I found it a little bit greasy. My mom ordered the island burger and hers was delicious! I definitely want to go back and try more of their creations."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is an amazing example that vegan food isn't boring! They kill it with their entire menu, but my favorites are the fried chicken sandwich, loaded fries & deli style sub sandwich. My partner loves the burnt tips!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",12/29/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My kids are extremely picky and they love Atlas chickn tenders and classic burger. You can't go wrong with the Kansas City Burt Tip and the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n. They are vegan comfort food at its best!
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/17/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Really friendly staff, the sweetest staff I have met. I was recommended the vegan fried chicken sandwich and it was incredible. The sauce on the chicken was the perfect tangy counterpart. The sandwich was so hefty and filling. Their french fries were also so flavorful. It was the best vegan comfort food that I had have in a while."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",4/22/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I've been here a few times and they have the most delicious vegan food I've ever had. Their ""chicken"" sandwhich is my go-to, and I will never get tired of it. Their mac-and-cheese is spectacular and their loaded fries are also amazing. Thr wait is usually a bit long, but if you order ahead of time, you can save yourself the wait. The food is completely worth the wait though!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",10/1/2017,$,3,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This was the next stop on my vegetarian/vegan chronicles. I was a little more pumped for this place because the pictures sold it as classic comfort or junk food. ,Ordered with our eyes, per usual.,Got the chickan wings- and I have to say, it was cute. Wrapped the doughy concoction on an ice cream stick to resemble wings. Taste did not match appearance. It was like bread slathered in buffalo sauce. Spicy bread on a stick. They were out of ranch sauce too, that is like a problem. Spicy anything needs a cooling agent.,Got the island patty because they were out of the meatball sub.,I am not typically a fan of rye bread so maybe my bias was on high- but I didn't love this sandwich. The caramelizad onions were good but the sauce is just not great for me. I didn't hate this, I would maybe try again on regular bread. Not sure.,We also ordered the loaded fries. Obviously this was my favorite thing. How do you go wrong with potatoes? Waffle cut style was great. I didn't love the sour cream or cheeze sauce they covered it in but whatever they use for the pastrami burnt ends that was pretty good. ,I don't love that water bottles here are small and over priced.,Maybe if my vegan friend demands we go again I'll try a second time so long as I can order the meatballs and give those a go."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Delicious all vegan food. The island Patty and the loaded fries were a perfect remedy for my hangover
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/8/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"If you like good comfort food, go here. If you are vegan, go here. If you are not vegan, still go here. If you want an idea of how good the food is here, we went while around the area in the pouring rain and there were STILL people waiting, soaking wet, for their food. The cashier guy taking our orders (bless him) had a smile on his face the entire time and greeted us warmly, despite being soaked and probably near hypothermic. I do not recommend coming here with a large party or on a really hot/rainy day seeing as this is a food truck with a small outdoor sitting area. We ordered the sausage and peppers sub and chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese not really knowing what to expect and I couldn't be more glad for that! I had zero expectations and was so pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious and so close to the real thing. The mac and cheese was a little demurely seasoned and could have used some more salt but overall we were happy with our orders. Atlas is representing vegan food the way it should be represented!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,My favvvv place in Miami ever!!!! Annnnnd my non vegan friends enjoy it too which is deff a plus. My favorite is the buttamilk chickn sandwich with loaded fries... their garlic aoli is super bomb so i don't mind paying the extra fee. Super reasonable prices. Thank youuuuu for providing the best food in town
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/30/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I usually have their vegan comfort food at the Yellow Green Market in Hollywood, but today I worked half day, and decided to stop by  their Miami location. Well, food truck that is...,They have limited hours (11-3pm, tue-fr), so to finally been able to catch them open, was a hit.,Geezzz... Miami heat it's unforgivable... I was planning to eat right there, but the 96 degrees were brutal. They have 2 large picnic tables, where patrons sit family style. One tiny fan didn't do it for me. They are serving from their food truck until September 2017, when their brick&mortar place will be ready next door.,They got busy very fast and suddenly we were like five people  waiting for our orders... ,So, I got their classic single patty burger with fries and a bottle of water for $13. ,Vegan burger was super delicious, super moist, filled with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  However,  next time I'll get the double patty. I wanted more, like a vegan vampire. ,I always want more!!!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/17/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas is the perfect spot for vegans who still love American classics! Everything on the menu is vegan, but closely resembles your favorite dishes (the loaded fried, classic burgers, Mac and cheese, and soda floats are our favorite!) ,Even though the location is a bit tricky for find, it is worth the search. Free street parking is located right outside of the eatery (which is rare in Miami). The outside eating area is great for sunny warm days, and the truck also offers daily happy hours deals from 1-3pm. On weekends and during lunch time I suggest ordering food to-go on their website or calling it in, to avoid long wait times. , ,Prices are a bit expensive ($15-$20 a person), but for miami that is expected, and for quality vegan food I'm willing to pay up.  South Florida is in need of some tasty vegan food and Atlas delivers!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Very flavorful classics but substituting the meat for meatless. I had the meatball sub and it was exceptional! Really great and I did not miss the meat at all. The meatless meatballs were amazing! This isn't your typical vegan place as many will think. They have bread, fries, sodas, so it's not one of those ultra-healthy places. Definitely a place I will come back to. Right now they are a food truck but soon to open a brick and mortar. I can't wait!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",11/27/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Wow, this humble looking spot is absolutely amazing! I would give more stars if I could. I went to Atlas meat-free deli yesterday because one of my best friends was visiting and she is a vegan, my boyfriend and I are not but all three of us loved our lunch. Everything is delicious, fairly priced and our food didn't take long at all. I would suggest the loaded fries! The ""meat"" on them has great flavor and texture, and their ""Mac sauce"" is super tasty as well. We also got the patty melt which I loved and the classic burger which has a nice ""meaty"" texture to it. My friend got the Mac and cheese, it tasted clean and creamy. She also got the hot wings, which are very spicy so be aware. I can't wait to go back and try their other enticing menu items. If you're looking for vegan comfort food this is your spot! Adorable food truck set up with charming ambience and tables. This is a must try!"

We tried the Buttermilk fried chic'n sandwich with coleslaw, vegan cheese, pickles in a pretzel bun. Amazinggggg. We also ordered the Island mac and cheese, it was creamy goodness with a very unique but perfectly executed twist on your traditional mac and cheese. Atmosphere is really quaint and surprisingly private. Overall it was fantastic. Will be back soon!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/18/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is a literal diamond in the rough! Don't let the area deter you from trying out some of the best vegan food you'll ever find. The guys at Atlas do a phenomenal job at preparing some of the best deli style dishes that keep me coming back for more. From their Deli sub to their loaded fries, everything in their menu is delicious. This place closes a little early, and sometimes certain dishes sell out, so Postmates comes in the clutch sometimes. One of the other cool things about Atlas is that you can purchase their vegan ""meats and cheeses"" by the pound, amazing! Try out the vegan cheese and enjoy the nice seating area to soak in some Miami sun. One of my favorite places in Miami!"

While health is very important to us, finding a balance between food that's good for you without compromising taste has been tough. My ex carnivore boyfriend has had trouble fully transitioning to vegan because he still craves meat! Atlas has the perfect solutions for him, a vegan place with a full bbq menu! It's nothing fancy but it does have a cute little courtyard to enjoy your meal at! This place was a great idea and I highly recommended it to anyone who is trying to make the transition away from meat!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/15/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This is probably my favorite vegan spot in Miami. The food is just incredible and really well priced. I had their patty melt and tried the burger. Both were phenomenal. They seriously give some of the better beef burgers a run for their money. The service was quick and friendly. It's set in an outdoor picnic table and you get your food and take a seat. Order ahead online, which threw me off first time I came but very easy to navigate. Definitely coming back again and again whenever I'm in the area. Definitely recommend!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/29/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This place is amazing. It is hard to find filling, comfort vegan food and this place has done it! Super cute atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food! Must try for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/19/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"The food was GREAT, the guys behind the counter were very friendly and the order came out quickly. It's a cute, hidden vegan gem, however, I cannot give it 5 stars because some inconsiderate woman lit up a cigarette after finishing her food right next to other people still eating. Nowhere is there a nonsmoking sign and no one asked her to go elsewhere with her cancer stick. Again, food, service and ambience are great--just wish there were non smoking signs up for people who clearly have no manners."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/29/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I absolutely loved everything I've tried here, it's comfort food for vegans and it's so good! The loaded fries are out of hand"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"This is my favorite vegan spot. I am so happy they finally opened a location in Miami. Located off 79th street they are currently serving out of their food truck, which is parked on their future permanent restaurant property, (currently being remodeled and crossing fingers will be ready in September).,For now, you can make yourself comfortable at one of their covered picnic tables and wait for your name to be called. My current favorite is the Island patty which doesn't look as impressive as the others but delivers in flavor. It is a burger patty served on rye with caramelized onions and their delicious island mac sauce. I also like the classic which is a big mac style burger and their fried chicken sandwich is very popular too except i find the ""chicken patty to thick for my taste"". They have added new items as well such as loaded fries and chicken tenders. You can turn any of your sandwiches into a combo with waffle fries and a drink (which you can pick out from one of their coolers). ,This is a laid back atmosphere focused on serving high quality, tasty, vegan comfort food. And I'm obsessed! if you don't believe me, Miami New times voted them best vegan restaurant of 2017! Need I say more?"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/2/2017,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Finally got to stop here for lunch today! It's a food truck that's a bit hidden off a side street. We were hesitant on sitting outside in this insane heat, but between the umbrellas and all the fans they had going we were actually quite comfortable. Great customer service followed by yummy vegan comfort food!! We started with the Island Mac and Cheese... I've had many vegan Mac and cheeses and this one was definitely unique and tasty! Then we got the classic burger and the Kansas City burnt tips sandwich, both served on a delicious pretzel bun... Both were really good but the the Kansas City burnt tips was definitely my favorite of the two. They were extremely filling despite what some would think of vegan sandwiches. We left stuffed!! I definitely want to come back to try the chicken sandwich!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/16/2017,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Oh, how I love meatless (vegan) places that aren't ""raw"" or just some wilted salads.  This place is AMAZING and I finally got to try it today (they have new, better hours).,The place is quite charming.  A food truck with a little garden area with picnic benches, a big fan, and nice people.,I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  OMG, huge portion for a very reasonable price.  The ""chicken"" was perfectly cooked and was real stick-to-your-ribs food.  It was really more than I could eat (consider sharing).   I also had a side of delicious fries (for like $3 more you can add a drink and fries).  There were a lot of people there today enjoying this meat-free, delicious food that no animals were harmed for.,I have nothing bad at all to say.  The guy taking the orders was very nice, and the chef was also super-nice.  I ordered a couple things left off my sandwich (cheese and some garlic stuff), and he perfectly accommodated that request.  I can't wait to go back and try something different.  All good!  Love Atlas!,p.s.  There's plenty of free street parking across from it, and also several places in front of it."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/1/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Amazing experience. If you have ever thought about being vegan or just want to eat a healthier lifestyle, check out this little place. We had the meatball sub and the burnt tip bbq sandwich. They were both so good and you would never know that it was veggies!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",3/11/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Awesome! Finally a Vegan place with really good food!! No trendy over priced tiny portions, the sandwiches are giant and reasonably priced! The ""chicken"" is so fluffy and savory. Fries are a bit over seasoned but def get the garlic aioli to dip them in! Cute backyard spot just wish they were open later. Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/21/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,All I have to say is... O.M.G. This vegan comfort food was so freaking great! They make everything from scratch including their dipping sauces and cheeses. Definitely should check em out if you're in Miami!
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/21/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Yum, yum, & yum!!!!!!! Took a few non-veg humans out here and they just adored it :) As a vegan, this is now easily one of my favorite spots! We got some great recommendations from the host and they were perfect. Yay for genuinely delicious vegan fake meats!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",5/31/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,Amazing vegan food! I've been here a few times and would highly recommend the loaded fries and the fried chicken sandwich. Yumm. I also love that they always have deals going on Yelp and Groupon. The only downside I noticed during my last visit was that there was a significant amount of fruit flies swarming us which made it hard to sit and enjoy the food. It had just rained earlier in the day so that could be the reason but it's definitely an easy fix for them so don't let it deter you from coming here.
"3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/12/2018,$,3,La Latina,"We were in the area and decided to check this place out for breakfast for their vegan arepas, which are all but two on their menu. I ordered my arepa with avocado and plantains, my husband ordered his arepa with black beans and avocado and a coffee. After we placed our order they let us know that they had no ripe avos! :( I'm part avocado so not having ripe ones is a big deal... We both had to settle for the black bean and sweet plantain arepas, which were pretty good just not what either of us initially wanted. ,Three stars for not having ripe avos AND for bringing my husbands coffee out after we had practically finished our arepas."
"2494 NW 89th Pl, Doral, FL 33172",6/18/2017,$,4,Macondo Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffees with milk alternatives readily available, including almond, coconut, and soy. Yummy gluten-free, vegan, and paleo treats/snacks available. Amazing, friendly customer service. Kitchen could use some improvement for to-order breakfast items. Cozy, casual ambiance. Will definitely be back soon!!"
"2494 NW 89th Pl, Doral, FL 33172",5/26/2017,$,3,Macondo Coffee Roasters,"They have some very good options here, and as a vegan I really appreciate the amount of snacks and other things I can stock up on for when I'm hungry at work. The Caribbean Cold Brew is a must try. The only thing I can critique is the somewhat spotty service and the fact that it's kinda messy."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",8/4/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Come here hungry and leave satisfied. Their burgers and sandwiches are everything. I've had a lot of good vegan sandwiches in my life and I'm going to say that for now, the Buttamlk Fried Chk'n has to be my fav.  The loaded fries were on point too and I appreciate the seasoning. ,The food did not arrive as fast as I am used to, but it was well worth the little wait. There is enough shade to block out the sun, and it feels very intimate and cozy, almost like I was in the back of a family cookout or something, but everyone there were strangers of course. It was just the vibe."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",7/7/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Stopped by Atlas with a friend to grab some hearty vegan food before hitting the beach. I'm glad I wasn't in too much of a rush, because, as a food truck, Atlas is small and gets busy fast--my friend and I waited almost an hour for our food. Normally I would knock a star off for such a long wait, but it was evident that there were a lot of orders and not a lot of time so 5 stars it is!,Since I wasn't planning on getting in the water or wearing a bathing suit, I wasn't afraid of having a food baby and decided to go big and order the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (at the suggestion of the cashier as well). It was the best decision EVER. ,First of all, the sandwich was the perfect size and so incredibly filling. For $9, I was thoroughly satisfied. I was absolutely stuffed at the end of this meal. The breaded and fried ""chicken"" cutlet was hearty and, although I usually don't care for fried foods, delicious. The slaw and rest of the sandwich toppings complemented it perfectly and gave the sandwich a fantastic range of flavors and textures. ,Overall, going to Atlas was an awesome choice, and I will definitely be back again. Would recommend!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/25/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I can take my non vegan friends here and they find the meals enjoyable: perk #1. Food is decadent to say the least and packed with flavor. They make everything in their kitchen as they have heir own vegan deli: perk #2. Love the waffle fries and the  buttermilk chicken, classic burger, LOADED FRIES, meatball sub and must definitely try the rest of the menu items, so plenty of visits left unless I plan for a Mukbang . Recommendation: go early or order ahead as in my experience they sell out of the popular items pretty quickly. Perk #3: Prices are right. ,Big yay for atmosphere and service with a smile.,Hoping for more locations in the South Miami area."
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",2/20/2018,$,5,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"SUPERB!!!! That's all I have to say about Atlas. I was shooketh of how flavorful a lot of the food were since it's vegan. The cheese sauce is so good!! I wish I can just sip it with a straw (jk but that's how good it is). The buttermilk ""chicken"" sandwich almost tastes like a real chicken sandwich. The loaded fries are delicious too. I think my favorite would have to be between the meatball marinara and classic burger! Both were just kicking my tastebuds with all the flavor and tasted almost identical to real meat. The meatball marinara has a strong taste of thyme (I think it's thyme, I don't mind it though). They also had a special sandwich, the Chimichurri Steak Special, and it was good! It was such a hit they're planning to add it to the regular menu. The server who takes the orders is so nice! He came back a couple times to check how we were doing. ,The only thing though is both times I've gone, I go a little late around 3:30-4ish. So by the time I go, a lot of things are sold out. I definitely recommend going earlier! The Mac and cheese ended up being cold. But everything was still delicious. ,Parking is a bit difficult if it gets packed since it's all street parking.,The sauce for the buttermilk tenders was a bit bland. I hope they can made a better sauce to go with it. ,Overall, I think it's great. I would definitely come back. Groupon also offers a deal for $12 on $20 worth of food! Check it out!"
"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",1/25/2018,$,4,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"Atlas Meat-Free began in the humble settings of the Yellow Green farmers market, but due to their popularity among the vegan debutantes they eventually branched out into Wynwood and then relocated to 79st. ,It was at the the YG farmers market that I first encountered Atlas Meat-Free, but the couple of times that I came I left unimpressed. Both times I ordered their much coveted marinara meatball hoagie that unfortunately lacked in any depth in flavor.,My yelp budette Nathaly L. who's a Liberal vegan activist was shocked that I didn't like the food here. She guaranteed that I would like this place, and that she personally was going take me there for lunch.,Fast forward a few months later, I get a text from Nathaly asking me to meet her at Atlas for lunch and that she was treating. Typically I don't allow Beautiful Latina women to treat me, I personally prefer to devoutly serve them, but I accepted her offer.,Finding this place was kind of annoying because they're located in a food truck hidden behind the building with their business address.,Nathaly asked me what I wanted and I told her I'll have whatever she's having ,Ordered :,2 Island Patty Melts - atlas ground burger with caramelized onions and island mac sauce, grilled pressed on rye ($9),1 Loaded Fries - seasoned waffle fries with garlic aioli and island mac sauce, topped with atlas burnt pastrami tips and jalapeños ($9),We got two free bottled waters with the yelp check-in.,Wow portions are huge, especially the fries, we couldn't even finish them.,Outside of Treelion and Konatas, this is the only other vegetarian/vegan place I know of that serves such generous portions.,The Patty melts were impressive, everything about them was tasty and filling, especially the caramelized onions.,The fries were delicious, almost perfect, this is actually the first time I've been able to eat fries without ketchup.,So my attractive little vegan debutante friend Nathaly L. won this round.,A note to consider: VEGAN does not equal GMO-free, pesticide free, organic or preservative free. I haven't seen anywhere on Atlas-free's website nor menu's stating it's free of any of the above aforementioned. Neither do they mention if their bread is free of HFCS or Potassium bromate(this crap causes hypothyroid).,In reality vegan just means that you're not eating another living beings foot or tail Etc."

"98 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/24/2018,$,3,Atlas Meat-Free Delicatessen,"I bought a groupon to try out this place. I'm trying to go vegetarian and love trying new locations. I would first say the location of this place is not very good, but they do have a very cute set up. I got a burger and although it looked very presentable there was something in it that tasted a bit sour. I only ate about half of it and had stomach pains the rest of the night. The fries were delicious though ...they also did not have many drink selections. This is a vegan fast food as the food is vegan but not all too healthy."
"94 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/3/2017,$$,5,Le Tartine Di Teresa,I think this is the only place I've found a real pumpkin vegan soup.  I asked the cook if she added dairy and she said it was only pure pumpkin. The consistency was the best. I haven't tried their full menu but I can tell this is going to be the Italian restaurant to go. I can't emphasis how good the soup was. I even took an order to-go.
"2494 NW 89th Pl, Doral, FL 33172",2/16/2018,$,5,Macondo Coffee Roasters,Awesome little coffee place with vegan options for drinks and food! Had some tasty and very filling oatmeal and a coconut iced coffee. I'll definitely return!

My husband and I tried the Wellness Smoothie, avocado toast and lentil bowl. As a traveling vegan, this was a rare find. Love the priority on healthy eating, which is unfortunately way too rare these days. Bravo to these awesome folks and their gamble that some people really do want healthy food, and it looks like it's paying off. Delicious!"

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/8/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Thank goodness for a wonderful vegan option in the heart of Kendall. Even non-vegans would be happy to eat here! Everything I have ordered has been amazing. I only wish they were open later and would deliver!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/9/2015,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Honestly, this was the most delicious smoothie bowl I've ever had. I had the dragon bowl and it is hands down gorgeous. It was delicious and all the fruit was perfectly ripe. It may be $8.50 but it was more than enough to share with my boyfriend. He enjoyed it too. It's nice to see a place like this, where a vegan can go and get something without it being a hassle in Miami. I can't wait to try more of their products. And the owner was sweet and adorable! I hope it does well!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is awesome. Juices are fresh and your body will thank you for drinking them. The food is delicious and extremely healthy - tastes like someone made it for you at home. I am not a vegan/vegetarian/health nut by any stretch of the imagination but I look forward to having a chance to stop in.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love having this place right next to school. I have never had anything that I didn't like. Their smoothies are great - Pitaya is my favorite! Their acai bowls are also amazing! I also can't get enough of their squash soup - it's made without cream just the vegetable since it's vegan. I've also had their lentil bowl. Everything is so good and best part, healthy!  Highly recommend for a nice refreshing meal, you won't be disappointed."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/17/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So very pleased to have an organic vegan spot in West Kendall. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is peaceful. Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious, never too pricey. I just hope they continue the all organic everything movement. Some places start of organic then start slacking. I really appreciate healthy and organic food that I don't have to cook myself all the time. Keep up the amazing job!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely LOVE this place! My sister showed it to me and I just love the atmosphere they have created, not to mention the staff is super sweet and the food super nutritious and delicious!!!

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOOOOVE this place. Just what kendall needed. The food is healthy and delicious, they have a variety of vegan choices, and the it's clean! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Now everyone seems to be raving over the dragon bowl, which is amazing, but my recommendations are either the fajita bowl or quinoa bowl paired with a pb+j smoothie. However, I have no doubts that anything you order won't be amazing."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/22/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm so glad a place like this opened up in Kendall close to where I live. This spot is perfect for a healthy/vegan/organic meal, snack, juice or smoothie. I wish I could eat here everyday! Roots is a small, modern, and very clean juice bar with a variety of options. I tried the fresh pressed juice named Verde I was worried I wouldn't find a juice without ginger (I'm not a fan) but they had several juices without it so I was pretty happy! As far as food, my favorites so far have been the quinoa bowl, acai bowl, dragon bowl, and avocado toast. I highly suggest you try the dragon bowl...so delicious! The owners are fully devoted in pleasing the customers. They are friendly and attentive and will give discounts for advertising their business on social media."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/25/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Great vegan spot! Wish they had one closer to Doral. Drove down to try it after hearing good reviews and was not disappointed. Simple and delicious vegan food and fruit smoothies!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The best restaurant in miami. I love the food is very healthy and the smothies are awsome!!! Enjoy the vegan life.

"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/21/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love love love this place! I am not vegan, but I would say this place is a vegans paradise! Every time I get a juice from Roots I instantly feel better, more energized, ready for my day. Their smoothies are sooo good! Crave is my favorite, it tastes like a cinnamon roll. I was never too much of a fan of pressed vegetables into a juice, but then I tried their juices and I never turned back(I've even thought about doing a juice cleanse, but I think I'll wait a while before doing that). Some people may think this place is expensive as all their juices/smoothies are $8 each, but you do get a lot of it. Also, if you're hungry I suggest you try the morning bagel! It honestly blew my mind when I remembered I wasn't eating actual cream cheese, it was full of flavor! Roots has a star reward program where if you get 10 stars you get a free drink! Totally recommend even if you're not into ""vegan"" places!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"love this place! great healthy option in the heart of kendall. this place reminds me of somewhere you'd typically find in coral gables or wynwood, so it's really refreshing to have healthier options closer to this part of town. i love the pb+j smoothie, and they have one of the best acai bowls i've tried. i love the atmosphere, even though it can get a little crowded while waiting for food during a rush. i'd rather pay $10 for a wholesome, vegan smoothie here vs $8 for a smoothie filled w sugar syrup somewhere else. it's priced about the same as any quality health food restaurant... not a ""cheap eats"" place, however quality ingredients cost more and you can tell the difference in the food and how you will feel after!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great staff, great service and most importantly great food! Really enjoy the acai bowl, PB&J smoothie! The zoodles with vegan bolognese was spectacular!"

No matter the occasion Roots is the place to be!!"

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll crave meat too but I don't feel as good after eating meat the way I do after I eat here. What you're looking at in this picture is the acai bowl and the avocado toast. I've also have had the quinoa bowl, lentil bowl and the dragon bowl. They've never missed the mark."

This place came highly recommended by a few people being that I'm always looking for vegan places and live in Kendall.. Omg. This place is phenomenal. Love the location, the food, the service! Only downfalls are (like all vegan restaurants) it's very pricey (but worth it) and it's very small, not enough seating. But that didn't mean I wasn't going to give this place anything less than 5 stars. I'm so happy it's so close to me, will be going there to often lol."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"What do you mean there's no meat!? I just had the frijole bowl and it was absolute fire. Portions didn't appear to be too challenging however, it fills you up fast. Barely able to withstand another bite, I mustered up the strength finish the last yummy morsel. The kind staff made for pleasant vibes. I may not be a vegan, but I can get used to eating like this especially if I get a free juice/smoothie for my loyalty."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This is a nice little place to get some healthy vegan meals and fresh raw juices. There isn't much seating, so if you come when it's busy you may choose to take your food with you. The prices are reasonable and the food is all healthy and tasty, the staff seem friendly and the overall vibe is nice. If you want a refreshing juice or a healthy place to eat as a vegan or vegetarian in Kendall this one is it."

I enjoyed the seating options inside and outside. ,I had the kidney bean dish with brown rice, asparagus and avocado/tomato toppings and it was really tasty. Like out of gramma's kitchen. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. ,I also had the crave smoothie, which was a little banana-y for my taste- I kinda wish it had more cacao taste, BUT it was my first time trying and when I go back I plan to try a new smoothie (the hot pink dragon fruit smoothie interested me) and maybe re-order the crave smoothie and ask for them to add more cacao flavor. I forgot to take a pic :( next time. I'll be back for sure."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Absolutely amazing! My favorite is the Quinoa bowl. The food is so fresh and delicious and I'm not even Vegan.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,What a cute little vegan spot. And its conveniently located near my gym. The smoothies are so delicious. I love anything tropical and these smoothies are as tropical as they can get. Will definitely be stopping by often. Pitaya super smoothie is the bomb!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I cant remember if its vegetarian or full vegan but even if youre not - like me- you will feel inspired by the ambiance of kumbaya. There is a tree in the middle of the communal table. There all these inspirational messages around this tiny yet airy locale, the staff is adorably passionate about the products and DO NOT be fooled by the wholesome good organic ingredients- these people have found a way to delight your tastebuds while lovingly reminding you to love all living things. My daughter had a mango smoothie and it was like none I have ever had. It was sophisticated and thick and yes- spicy. I dont even like spicy. But this. This was beautiful. It wasnt cheap -like $8 but like a great meal.  So satisfying. The hours are strict though - closed by 630p weekdays and must check weekend times. But it was clearly a nod to holistic living where we all equally respect and enjoy time. Next time we are trying the smoothie bowls which people keep raving about. But I feel like I gotta fast for two days first - to be deserving of such holy fare. To make room for the calories. (Lets not confuse healthy ingredients for low calorie ones - hahahaha!). Oh yes. We are going back."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"WOW!!!! What an amazing place and within walking distance of my office! Roots is a small, quaint and modern juicebar that makes all of their own juices daily with the freshest of ingredients. They bottle their juices but can make a smoothie or other juice for you on request too. They serve vegan sustainable food that is absolutely delicious! I had the Lentil bowl and not only did it fill me up, but it was full of flavor! I had their ""Cooler"" green drink which is a blend of Fennel Root, Basil, Cucumber, Lime, and Apple. It was absolutely amazing! I took a Cashew milk to go and also their Avocado toast. The owner said that if I just call him he can deliver the food to me on the days that I work which I think is really awesome. ,It's really nice to have local places like this that serve a variety of different and highly nutritious food. They are so passionate about what they do and tell you the health benefits of everything in their food. NSU employees get a discount too! (Although the discount for checking in on Yelp is better :) ,I am looking forward to having healthy lunches and post-workout drinks/meals now. This place was really awesome! It's definitely small and cannot seat that many people, but it's such a great place!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/24/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Finally the Kendall area has a healthy vegan place! The wellness smoothie... amazing!  The avocado Toast is good for anytime of the day, I recommend and try the superfood salad, it's very good and it also has avocado. I definitely enjoy this place, the atmosphere, the service and the food so many great nutrients, loving roots."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,I am literally obsessed with everything they offer!! I'm vegan and my boyfriend is a flexitarian; we both love the flavors this place offers in their food!! My only problem is that it is so out of my way lol im never in this area but maybe its for the best because i would probably eat there every day!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is such a godsend in kendall where there aren't many vegan/gluten free options (or even relatively healthy options for that matter). Only wish their hours of operation were a bit later. My favorite is the zucchini spaghetti!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/7/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I like this juice bar.  The dragon bowl and acai bowl are good.  The salads and smoothies are good too.  I just hate it's so far and in the middle of traffic armageddon lol.  But it is worth going to.  I had the avocado toast, it was ok.  Great place for vegans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,There's no better vegan spot in Miami than Roots. Best Pitaya Juices and bowls in town. The staff is beyond 5 stars. Highly recommended!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/30/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've been vegan now for 4 months and roots has made it so easy! I've been to roots now at least every other week and every visit has been an overall great experience. I've had almost everything on the menu but their breakfast has to be my favorite. Their bowls both the acai and dragon fruit are perfection and the avocado toast is heaven ! Their juices are also a great pick me up, I've had the ""got the beet"" but the ""rise and shine"" is my favorite. My work hours don't usually allow me to swing by for lunch but I've been able to try the fajita bowl and it was very filling the portion size was great and it was perfectly seasoned ! ,The food isn't the only thing I love about roots the ambiance really is what keeps me coming back. From the books put out for guests to read as they wait for their food to the cute foliage put out on the tables it all makes me want to spend my entire day there. On my last visit I saw that it was quite packed and I was very happy to see them doing so well I hope people continue to grow interest in health conscious food. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 starts is because I have heard from people I recommended Roots to that the customer service could be better and up to a certain extent I would have to agree. With that said though Roots is just what Kendall needed may their success be more than they ever expected !"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/11/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is very good. There isn't any vegan places around Kendall so this is a great option. Around lunch time it gets packed because the place isn't big but the food truly is delicious. Their avocado toast is probably my favorite and their dragon bowl. They accept Apple Pay so it's convenient. They have very good pre-made juices and shots as well.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/20/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing and absolutely awesome place! Our favorite! We come here quite a few times a week throughout the year and we love it that way! Great healthy, wholesome, vegan food, and great people! Always on point! Come join them for a meal!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/29/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This is currently my favorite vegan restaurant in Miami. The bowls are delicious. The juices are phenomenal. The service is excellent. Just wish they had another location further east. Love love love it!!!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I absolutely love this place. Vegan food is delicious and they are super dog friendly. I went there the other day and was with my baby and dog, stressed out and hungry. Not only did they carry my food out but they went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and okay. Thank you for caring so much about your customers, the animals and the planet! Businesses that do good like this get great karma points. Namaste!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/14/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,It's a small cute little vegan Juicebar . Options are great so was the food! The only problem is the prices just a little high.Other  than that  definitely would recomend !
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Maybe it was conditioning today or the run @richie.ramirez_  took me on after training... but I was starving and could not make up my mind... so I got the Frijoles bowl (my fav) for post work out lunch and a Zoodles bowl with vegan bolognese for dinner later.. along with Love Potion #9  all thanks to @rootsjuice for making veggies taste sooo good! Thank you @rootsjuice Love you guys. Stop by for a snack, lunch or a great Acai bowl they got it all."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/19/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was looking for a neighborhood place that serves a non dairy option for cappuccinos. I found Roots on google so i gave it a shot. I loved my almond milk cappuccino and cant wait to try them for breakfast or lunch. Such interesting options that fit perfectly into my vegan diet. I appreciate having a healthier choice of food in Miami so thanks Roots for opening close to me. ,I keep coming back for more because the food is so craveable. I love love love everything!!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm a vegan. Hands down the best Vegan restaurant in Miami! The prices are fair and the quality is outstandingly great. The ambience is very chill and cool. Other than the place being small, everything is amazing!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/30/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I've recently become a vegan and my friend recommend me to come here after my workout. Let me tell you how amazing the food is here. I always leave here feeling good. I had the frijoles bowl with brown rice, asparagus, chopped up tomatoes and avocados. Very yummy! Also, their smoothies are delicious. A little pricey but worth the try! Recommend for smoothie: Pitaya and the Crave Smoothie."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Was craving an Acai bowl, and saw all the raves about this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. They did not disappoint. I had their regular acai bowl with their vegan smart vanilla protein powder added in. It was so good! I really liked the option of adding protein powder because I had never seen that before. I definitely will be coming back! Highly recommend!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Can't believe it has taken me this long to find this place!  As a vegan I felt out of luck looking for a great place to dine in Kendall.  Scrolling through Instagram I came upon a picture of the Frijoles bowl (my favorite food on the menu) I am glad I found it. ,It is a quick and go place so not restaurant but as the titles suggest it's a bar so just a few tables to dine. Staff was very friendly and made suggestions as it was my first time.  Staff also asked how was if my food selection was what i was expecting , showing how much they care about customers feedback.  The hours are not as convenient for me as a full time employee but gives me a reason to get up early on the weekends."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Kendall has a hot new vegan spot. Good location and easy to reach.,Their salads are so fresh and made with a great combo of ingredients. ,Prices are good except for their $8 per juice. $5 is what they should go for.,I still give them 5-stars because the food is so good and this is a true ""healthy vegetarian"" place since so many other vegan restaurants have so many carb-filled bread and pasta dishes where this place focuses on vegetables and beans."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/19/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this place. Great salad, lentil bowl, vegan deserts, and juices. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is a positive vibe."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/13/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I come to this place as often as I possibly can! They never disappoint and they have such a friendly staff! My staples here are The Crave smoothie, the Acai bowl, and the Avocado Toast ! Also, if it's available, a slice of their vegan carrot cake is my obsession!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Quality quality quality!!!! This is one of the very few all natural all organic all vegan places in Kendall. It's easy to tell it's in high demand because they always have a line out the door! I always order ahead but there food and smoothies are amazing and definitely worth the money! Feels like you're doing your body good! Get more locations!!! Or a bigger space!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem quite daunting and complicated. For me it's about making one change at a time and not all at once. This vegan friendly restaurant is my go-to the days I don't feel creative in the kitchen or right out have no clue what I'm going to cook that day. It's a 20 minute drive from my home but well worth it. There are no words to describe how good everything on the menu is and I mean everything!! My favorites are the Dragon Bowl for breakfast and Zoodles Bowl for lunch. If you want to feel brand new eat @ Roots. Your body will definitely thank you!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/10/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Love this vegan juice bar/ cafe. They have great options are different types of juice and healthy snack juices like acai bowl, dragon bowl, quinoa bowl and avocado toast. Not only the food is delicious, people are friendly, it's a perfect Instagram spot as well. ;),I tried the dragon bowl, it's huge and sosososo good! I didn't expect a layer of granola at the bottom too. Love it! The granola is no generic, full of flavor and various seeds. ,Will come back to try other stuff for sure!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love roots juice bar, it's one of my favorite places to eat usually on Sunday's for lunch (They changed their times and they're opened every day now which is a plus!).I usually get the lentil bowl, and it comes with brown rice and a side of veggies. I have tried most of their food bowls on their menu, and all of them are delicious! Their vegan chocolate cake is amazing! Also, they do have signs by the register that states that food may take up to 20 mins just because their food is served fresh, so there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Excellent vegan place!! The food is great and very healthy. The avocado toast is amazing and every dish is fresh and delicious. I wish there are more Roots locations. A must!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I received an add from Yelp, telling me about healthy eating places near me, so I decided to give this place a try, I'm not really a vegan but really enjoy healthy foods. Wanting to give his local place a try I ordered a few things, Dragon bowl... delicious, Morning Bagel... WOW, Lentil bowl....double WOW, I also decided to try the Avocado Toast because all the reviews ranted about it, I think it was too salty, a little less salty & I think it will be great. Overall the food was a total success, I will definitely be coming back to try some more items from their menu"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/16/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I came out to Miami during my sister's best friend's wedding. This place happened to be next to the hotel we were staying at, so I decided why not give this place a try? This is a raw vegan restaurant and juice bar, although they cook their food. For my meal I had the zucchini noodles with vegan Bolognese and a green soup. I really enjoyed the zucchini pasta (zoodles) because they really fill you up and trick your brain into thinking your eating spaghetti. The Vegan Bolognese was very thick and chunky in consistency like its traditional meat counterpart. My green soup was very well seasoned and I could appreciate the distinct taste of broccoli in it. The staff here are incredibly friendly. The day I came in, the place was packed with a line out the door and despite this the nice girl at the counter stopped what she was doing for a moment and gave me a knife when I asked for one. I don't go to Miami very much, but if I do, I will be sure to stop by here again to try more of their items!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",9/27/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been hesitant to try this place due to the location being in a very heavy traffic area. Recently I stopped by for the first time and I was really impressed with the place. I ordered a dragon fruit smoothie, a bagel with vegan cream cheese and a vegetable soup and everything was delicious. Making a healthy vegetable soup is hard to do and they do it so well. I love that they use organic ingredients and environmentally friendly to go packaging. This is a great spot if you're looking for a healthy or organic option."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",10/5/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"One of my favorite vegan spots in south miami. My favorite is the bean bowl and zucchini pasta. Not once have I been disappointed when I go to this place. Everything from the juice, smoothies, food and dessert never disappoints. Very attentive staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/9/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Amazing service . Staff had excellent knowledge of everything and let us try different fruit because adding it in the smoothie. This is a hole in the wall because I would've never noticed if it was for a friend who recently went from vegetarian to vegan and wanted to try this from Yelp reviews. ,It's very peaceful and quiet. Parking says 1 hour only."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/4/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love this place! I am excited to find places like this (Vegan/Vegetarian options!) in Miami / Kendall area! The atmosphere is very nice, have many options on their menu. I had the Quinoa bowl and Love potion (beet, pineapple, pear, ginger, chia) juice!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"So i'm not vegan or even health-conscious over my food, but after having a friend talk my ear off about how much she was craving an acai bowl, i decided i must try one for myself. ,Roots is not at all on my way. I happened to be in the area and Yelp recommended them when i searched for a local Juice Bar. ,Let me tell you, i am so glad i stopped in here. The atmosphere is adorable: trendy white couch, stool seating along the windows, and a communal picnic table with an artificial tree sprouting in the middle. There's open cooler with fresh beds of wheatgrass, their pressed and bottled juices, and other assorted drinks. The kitchen is partially visible from the register so you can see most goings-on with your food. Their menu can be found on clipboards all around the shop so ordering is more expedient. ,I ordered the Acai Bowl and their Lentil Bowl. Immediately, the young woman said I made good choices but that it would be a lot of food if it was all just for me. I absolutely loved that. I let her know that I was planning on eating the Lentil Bowl later in the day, and asked if it would keep until then. She rang me up and said she'd fulfill the acai bowl order first and whenever i felt it was a good time to go, she'd fulfill the lentil bowl order so i could leave with the freshest food.,The Acai Bowl was the first i've ever had, and i may have ruined myself for any other. Their portions are large and filling; their toppings are liberal and a real treat. The bowl had a multitude of toppings, but also the bottom of the bowl had a generous layer of granola and chia seeds. It was definitely my happiest food experience in 2016. Every spoonful was savored and by the time i was near finished, a gentlemen had dropped off a warm brown bag with my lentil bowl. ,So in the end, I've been trying to give myself an excuse to get back into this area and stop by Roots again. 5/5 in everything: quality, service, value. No other bowls have met my standards."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/4/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,So far I have been here twice and each time I really did enjoy it. The first time around I ordered a smoothie and the avocado toast. My husband and I really enjoyed both. The second time around we did have one of their bowls which was pretty tasty. I do like the vibe in there. It can be a little to warm in there though. I definitely plan on going back again. It is a great healthy option regardless if you are vegan or vegetarian or not.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts. 100%recommended."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/15/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Best vegan/healthy food in town. I am not even vegan or a daily healthy eater and I loved everything from the juices, the food and the deserts."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/24/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Incredible. Shared the fajita bowl (without the spicy peppers), avocado toast, and a butternut squash soup and it was AMAZING! Even my non-vegan family member thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back.,Also, the presentation was so cute! I'm just digging everything about it."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/20/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Such a cute little juice bar! I live in the area but only recently heard about it. When I heard there was an a vegan all plant-based foodie heaven near me I was all about it. I didn't want to get my hopes up as far as taste because I feel I am really picky. I ordered the lentil bowl and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. The lentil bowl comes with brown rice, broccoli, zucchini and carrots - can't complain. I'll be back to try juice and breakfast bagel."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Great Vegan Friendly options. Very clean and friendly staff.  Food was really tasty. I recommend the Quinua Bowl, the Bean Bowl, and the Açaí bowl."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super fresh and tasty. Made me feel more alive when I ate this food. Great variety and high quality food. Definitely one of the best vegan/vegetarian spots in this area. Wish that there was more space to sit inside.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/26/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,The customer service and cleanliness of this place is impeccable. Loved its all plant-based menu. It's a must-go for vegans and vegetarians in the Kendall area.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/19/2016,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"A solid 4.5 stars...This juice bar is exactly what West Kendall needed. Its fast, delicious, convenient, and vegan. It's tucked away in a shopping center behind a hotel so it's hard to find. But no worries, plug it in your GPS and it takes you right there. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Very simple and inviting décor. They have an array of juices and smoothies. Their food menu is small but definitely not lacking in flavor. All the menu items are plant based and for the most part organic. ,I tried: ,Avocado toast: The flavor was delicious. I just wish the avocado had thicker chunks and not have so much of a creamy consistency. The addition of the chia seeds were exceptional and gave it the final touch. ,Vegetable soup: Once again amazing flavor but I felt all I got were blended vegetables. I like when there is heartiness in my soup and I can actually crunch on a vegetable or two. ,Dragonfruit Acai Bowl: O.M.G! Best bowl I have ever had! Hands down. The toppings were so delicious. Banana, strawberry, kiwi, blueberries, coconut chips, granola, and chia seeds decorated the bowl beautifully and sat on top of the perfectly blended dragon fruit. Its a must order. ,and last but not least....The wonderful Lentil Bowl: I loved this so much. The lentils were so so so good! I tip my hat off to the wonderful person who seasoned this dish so beautifully. This bowl comes with a heeping serving of lentils, brown rice, and grilled vegetables. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Portions were the perfect size. ,I will definitely be coming back to this location. I know for sure I will be ordering The dragonfruit bowl and the Lentil Bowl. Two delicious concoctions that are worth trying! ,Cannot wait to try their juices. ,P.S. parking can be a bit of a pain. Don't fret, when you drive into the small plaza there is more parking if you keep driving straight."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/5/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Being a vegan, I can tell you this place is a great spot! They have delicious food bowls, my favorite being the Dragon bowl! They also have several other lunch items that are extremely tasty and fresh, I would definitely recommend the zoodles and avocado toast... their desserts are also amazing, most of them are vegan and again, very very tasty! I have tried several of their smoothies and they are also very fresh, made to order, and absolutely delicious!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/12/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is Vegan but you don't need to be Vegan to eat here! This place's menu is EXTREMELY good. I have been there more than 12 times this year alone (it's a little far from my house but if i could go more I would) The açaí bowls are so refreshing and make you feel satisfyingly full because of how healthy it is. The peanut butter smoothie is fantastic (I'm not really a big fan of peanut butter but I still get it) the people are always welcoming and sweet. I really enjoy the environment as well, it's a cute little place and you can sit around outside as well. This is my favorite place to eat. I'm not the healthiest person in the world but I really do crave the açaí bowls often."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/18/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I am writing this review purely from the point of view as a customer, I used to work here a year ago and I will not relate my work experience to the establishment... The menu has a nice variety of choices to get, my favorite are the wellness smoothie (a fresh tasting green smoothie) and the crave smoothie(vanilla/cinnamon goodness). Another favorite of mine are the zoodles (zuccinni  noodles), they are served with a vegan bolognese sauce. I used to use the Yelp check in/20% off when I would come here but now they are saying they aren't accepting it anymore. If that is the case, take it off Yelp because it is misleading. This visit I ordered an avocado toast and a crave smoothie. The toast came out quickly but 15 minutes later I'm still here waiting for my smoothie while the girls behind the counter chat about stair masters and working out, usually they bring the food all together. As of customer service, associates could be friendlier maybe try smiling. Vegan = HAPPY"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/23/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,the time to get the food  it is my only concern...every thing else it is GOOODD AND FRESH.. i highly recommended to any vegan friends
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/15/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I have been working on going vegan for some time now and the food here is AMAZING! I am a fan of the dragon fruit bowl, coffee, and fajita bowl! They are expensive but most health food places are so it is expected. ,I have to take out two stars, not because of the food (which I encourage everyone to go try), but because of the customer service. I have realized they are becoming more popular and now are much more frantic, making more mistakes and, even making rude comments at times.  Many times, when I call in to place an order to avoid waiting in the crowded little seating area, they don't pick up. I recently mentioned this to one of the employees (I think he could have been the manager, but I am not sure), and he told me ""I can't do 5 things at once!"" I think they lack a little bit of professionalism, but it's still great food in a convenient area close to where I live. so mehhhh..."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",11/27/2016,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not vegan by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I do love my smoothies & bowls and Roots delivers on both! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl. I've had Dragon/Pitaya bowls around the US and even internationally. And in my opinion Roots' version is the best. All the toppings work well together and everything is o nicely presented. ,I have also tried their juice cleanse 2x. I do pretty well on 3 day cleanses with rarely a headache. They will offer suggestions on how to deal with any effects. The first time, I received all clear juices. The 2nd time, I received some of the same juices plus one thicker juice and one cash mylk. I think that the addition of the thicker drinks should help those that have a hard time with cleanses as the thicker juices/mylk are pretty filling.  ,The avocado juice was delish and the cash mylk was also tasty. I do not like celery and three of the juices contain celery. The green ones I chugged. While the beet juice was more palatable. I loved the morning juice.  Mind you, this is just my personal opinion. All in all, it was a great cleanse.,I have been coming here since it was the place for the best cuppie cakes on the planet (cough, cough). And the staff and owners have always been super friendly and welcoming. The shop is so cute and offers seating both inside & out. Orders are prepared once placed so if you are in a rush, you can place your order online right here on Yelp! And it will be ready for you to pick up."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/17/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Hands down my favorite Vegan Food Spot in Miami! My favorite thing is the ""Fajitas Bowl"" and the Love Potion #9 Juice. I also like the Frijoles Bowl and Dragon Fruit Bowl. The place is small but I love it inside. The atmosphere is good and everything is made to order so it tastes very fresh. I hope that they open up more restaurants in the near future and they should really think about opening on Sundays."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/12/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Roots is a very tasty juice bar, it has all the vegan favorites. I'm not vegan but I do like from time to time a healthy alternative. ,One of my side jobs is next door so it makes a nice and convenient meal/shake for me during my lunch break. ,I usually have my favorite the PB&j shake. Very tasty and full of flavor. ,If you've never had Avo bread before make sure you ask for it. It's tasteful and light! It'll sure make your tastebuds happy. ,If in the area and looking for something healthy and different try Roots out. It's sure not to disappoint"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/9/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,My go-to place for acai/dragon bowls and healthy vegan food. Everything I've tried was delicious. The place is also very cute and simple and the service is great.
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/21/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,This place is right by school and it's pretty great. It is only vegan so they do not have many options although I love vegan foods. I got a avocado/kale salad of some sort with a spicy sauce. That was delicious! Downside part of this place is the wait and how busy it gets! A tip would probably be to open up earlier
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Ok, so I had not tried an Acai bowl because as most things are now in days I thought it was a fad hipster dish. I thought it's a smoothie in a bowl how great can that be...OMG WAS I WRONG. Yes, to some people it's still a fad to go vegan because that is the cool thing now in days, I'm not vegan but I do have a plant based diet day a week. The acai bowl is toooo die for. I can die and go to heaven now, so so so good! I don't even have words to describe the perfection that the acai bowl is. I'm going to try the avocado toast next time I come here."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/3/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Absolutely love the acai bowls from roots. They are reasonably priced, have tons of toppings and tastes delicious! The shop is really nice and clean inside, however, it is kind of small which makes it feel very cramped when it is very busy. There's not so many places to sit so I always opt for take out. The best way to do take out here is to either call ahead or order through yelp because there's not too much space to wait around if it's very busy. Made that mistake once and felt super claustrophobic. There isn't that much seating, there's a little community table which is cute but when the line gets long it feels like people are right on top of you. The decorations and style of the place are cute though. Definitely a cute little spot to hang out if it's not busy but if it is I would come back later or do take out. The food is definitely worth it though. It's one of the only vegan/juice bars in the area that have fresh fruits and are good quality without being overpriced."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/6/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Delicious place! Smoothies are alright, but let me tel you! THAT FAJITA BOWL WAS AMAZING!!! Prices were pretty average for a juice bar, not bad. staff was very friendly and attentive and hardworking! This place is a beautiful place spreading the vegan message. I like the steps towards being more green. Also I love that they had vegan smoothie bowls! Food was good, the smoothie was just what I needed!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/8/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I'm not vegan, but I love the food they serve at this place. Whoever is the owner really did a good job when hiring the chef. Also, I would like to know which coffee do you use? Where is it from? Because I enjoyed it! I have tried almost each one of the meals in their menu and have liked all of them!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"GO TO ROOTS JUICEBAR! I have tried almost every vegan place in Miami and Roots is by far, my favorite place to eat at. Compare all the prices for an acai bowl between every vegan place and look back at Roots. It is very affordable and their food will fill you up. They have a variety of meals and smoothies, which makes them my go-to when I am near kendall. I am excited for their new location opening in Doral."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",1/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Please visit this place whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, you will fall in love with the food, açaí bowls as well as the cozy, coffee shop ambience. Try the frijoles bowl and the avocado toast."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/8/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,Super good Vegan place in West Kendall. Try the bowls and the juices. The avocado toast is super delicious as well. #savetheanimals
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/28/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"This place is pretty awesome. Their menu ranges from options of lentil soups, to sandwiches, salads, juices, energy bowls, and anything in between. It's a vegan's heaven. It is a bit pricey, but that expected at most of these health and ethically conscious restaurants. I still have a ton of meals to try out on their menu, and so far I've loved their lentils, dragon bowls, avocado toast, juices, smoothies, and a few other options-basically everything has been great thus far. ,I like to come here often, usually whenever I'm in the Kendall area. Whenever I bike or drive out to the Kendall Regal Village, I like to grab a bite to eat here if I'm hungry, especially if I have just finished a workout at the LA Fitness, or finished a film at the theater, or finished picking up art supplies at Michael's, or have been spending my afternoon at Barnes & Nobles. Honestly this little mall plaza has just about everything I love, and it's my own personal escape on Kendall Drive. So the location of this vegan restaurant just makes it that much better. I used to come here a lot more back when I worked in the area, but I still come here often enough because of my gym membership and the other stores. I'm surprised it took so long for me to write a review. ,Parking is free and it's a private lot. There's also bike parking, so it's perfect. And free wifi! So between here and the Barnes & Nobles, it's a great location to study or read if you want to get a change of scenery from the library or your house. ,The staff is friendly and I enjoy their service. No complaints. You do get 20% off of your purchase on check-in, so keep that handy! ,I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here, as I've been trying to introduce him to more vegan options and vegan restaurants. It's difficult to convince him because he eats meat and is stubborn, but when I come with him I will recommend he gets one of their higher calorie/higher protein options, since that's his main hesitation to vegan food-he thinks it's not enough calories or protein for the price, especially for someone like him who is trying to gain weight. *sigh* There are plenty of options for everyone, even for those who work out and are looking for plant based protein.  ,Overall it's a great experience, tasty and healthy vegan food, great location and convenience of being right off Kendall Drive, and free bike and car parking. Did I mention how that is so perfect? They take card and cash, too. I only wish they stayed open later."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/9/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I yelped ""salads"" and this place popped up. On the drive there, I was excited to have found a place like this in Kendall (when I think juice bar and vegan, I think Miami Beach). The cashier was kind and made a suggestion for my order. I am always happy to hear suggestions, especially when it's my first time. I ordered a caramel macchiato (with almond milk--as per her recommendation) and it was delicious! Not bitter, not overly sweet. I also ordered an avocado toast--light yet satisfying. I tend to go overboard with new things so I fully intend to go back tomorrow to try a smoothie! ,My one complaint is how tiny the space is! There isn't much space to wait for your meal if it's to go. If you choose to dine-in, the seating is very VERY limited. Granted, this was lunch time so I completely understand. I will return during non-peak hours."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Very clean great smoothies great juices. Great food . Highly recommend vegan or vegaterian or just healthy. I have been here a few times now and the food is always delicious. I love the lentil bowl, and you get so much! It is a little expensive but these types of places always seem to be. Love that the menu is all vegan, makes it so easy to order.Had the kale juice and a comfort bowl for my wife. They were both good. ,PS: Pet friendly."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",3/13/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First time customer, went in for the Açaí bowl but they were out. Chose the Dragon bowl instead--very appealing to the eyes and delicious to the palate, and very filling too. The music played there was a little too loud if trying to have a conversation with friends, but otherwise a perfect place to hangout. Love the vegan themed art & decor. Friendly staff."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",5/25/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"LOVE! The food is delicious, nutritious and eco-friendly. The service is super fast and friendly and the environment/ decor is awesome (they always play the best music too). I am a huge fan of their menu, which is 100% vegan (and I'm not even vegan). I highly recommend the frijoles bowl, the morning bagel and the dragon bowl...YUM! Also, if you're ever feeling sick, take one of their ""good and well"" natural juice shots. It has cayenne pepper in it, so if you're not comfortable with spice, you may want to stay away. But seriously, I've started taking these shots when I'm sick and they make me feel SO much better! Overall, a great go-to place for delicious, healthy, feel-good food and great service."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",6/23/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I honesty have to thank the owner for this change. I remembered this place having sweets and I had no Idea I had a vegan friendly restaurant right around the corner. I am transitioning into veganism after getting educated and realizing the damaging affects of processed foods, meats and dairy. Was so happy to find out the food was not only delicious but wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. I love the story of this place and the fact that it cares about what they provide you with. The juices are expensive yes but do have a blend of a lot of different things that help your nutrition . I'm your new loyal customer and can't wait to order more meals throughout my week! ,Thank you! :),P.S. Please make a loyalty program!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",8/12/2017,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I went for the first time today and I'm definitely going back! I loved all the vegan options! Considering most vegan places are on the pricier end, I didn't think this place was so bad. I had the Pitaya smoothie with dragon fruit, mango banana etc. this vibrant drink was tasty and very filling. I can't wait to go and try some of their food."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",4/11/2017,$$,3,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"First I'd like to make clear that I am NOT a vegan, and I had no idea this was a vegan place, but that didn't deter me from trying out their smoothies. They clearly have a fan base, because at 930 AM when they open there was already lines. , I decided to try a Crave smoothie consisting of Vanilla bean, dates, bananas, cinnamon, chia seeds, cacao and Almond milk. It wasn't bad. I also ordered the Breakfast Bagel with Cashew Cream cheese and spinach on a wheat bagel. I knew I would like the bagel, because I love anything with Cashew, I wasn't crazy about the spinach but I ate it anyways ( my first time ever eating spinach) , I respect other people's choices of what they put in their bodies, but I couldn't live on a vegan diet. It's a very nice small place with lots of employees, the service was friendly and I can see myself returning to try some of their cold pressed juices.,I tried their cold pressed juices and I didn't care for them. Ginger is too overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the RISE & SHINE Juice. ,Also I wonder why ""healthy"" food is so expensive if it doesn't contain many of the preservatives and ingredients as ""unhealthy"" food does. I imagine less ingredients less spendings."
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/17/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,I love this place. Be good is always fresh and delicious.  Açaí bowls are fabulous and the cakes are scrumptious. Nice place you can sit inside or outside.  Everything is Vegan!
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",2/7/2018,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I was introduced to this place today, and I am so happy I was! The location itself is a bit hidden, but the food was delicious. When I saw the menu, I got super excited because I am always looking for new vegetarian/vegan friendly places that serve fresh, tasty food. ,The cashier recommended the quinoa bowl,,and it did not disappoint! Quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, avocado, tomatoes, broccoli, and more in what tasted like a basil pesto type sauce. Yummmm! ,I will definitely be back to try more!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",7/27/2018,$$,5,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"I love Roots. Great smoothies, vegan bowls and desserts!  Even if you are not vegan you will love this place!!"
"8530 SW 124th Ave, Miami, FL 33183",12/1/2017,$$,4,MyRoots Juice Bar & Kitchen,"Been coming here more because I've been training for work next door. They have great vegan options which makes it great for people who go plant based.,I have had their lentils and frijoles bowl for lunch and they were good but wasn't satisfying for my cravings. The food was very filling and nutritious. The portion was also good enough to share with 2 people. Smoothies are great too. They aren't loaded with sugar and have tons of antioxidants.,My favorite there would be the acai bowl. It has varieties of fruit other than strawberries and bananas. The granola is nice and crunchy and adds the perfect amount of sweetness. They also have almonds and toasted coconut flakes which give each bit a different taste. The serving size is pretty large and can be shared with 2 people. The price I would say is still pricey.,I am now giving them a 4 of 5 because of their philosophy. They are purely plant based and believe in high quality ingredients."
"11865 SW 26th St, Miami, FL 33175",4/7/2016,$$,5,Sushi 2 Mee,This place is awesome. They listen to what you order and will literally deliver almost anywhere. Finally a place that doesn't compromise their quality of food and service. Plus I'm vegan and I can eat happily
"1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/10/2018,$$,5,My Ceviche,"This is a restaurant with great healthy, gluten free options , and vegan options.  The prices are extremely reasonable to cheap and service is quick. The Resturant is set up similar to a chipotle inside."
"8201 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33144",1/4/2017,$$,3,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"Olive Garden is okay. It's not my favorite, but I've never had a bad experience here. The food is standard Italian, with a good variety of pastas and lasagnas, salads, etc. There were a couple vegan and vegetarian options but it was extremely limited. ,It's usually pretty loud in here, every time I come here it's when I've been invited by others, and it's an enjoyable restaurant, but it's not what I have in mind when I think Italian. It just feels too Americanized as a chain restaurant. But, I have a bias for chain restaurants so maybe it's just me. The wine selection was decent, and the servers were friendly. It's just that the food and atmosphere didn't really do it for me. It was just a little too bland and it didn't taste fresh-more like it was out of a box or something. But, they do serve a good amount of food and they are not stingy with appetizers and portions, so that's a plus. ,Just expect to wait a long time for seating because it always seems packed with people whenever I go with a group."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",8/17/2017,$$,4,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"The food was great although for me, the vegan choices were very limited.  Their menu does list the vegan choices however and the vegan speciality they had, the only vegan entree, was fantastic.  A little expensive but not ridiculous and if you're a wine drinker, I'm not, it's probably 5 star as they have a lot of wines and even a wine tasting barrel."
"3585 NW 83rd Ave, Doral, FL 33147",6/29/2017,$$,5,Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant - Doral,"My first time going to Cooper's Hawk was an enjoyable one! I went for dinner last night 6.28.17 with a group of girlfriends and loved it so much, I've been raving about it to everyone since! I can't wait to return for happy hour! The restaurant is located in CityPlace, a new upscale entertainment shopping mall-like area in Doral. Our reservation was for 7:30pm, but we had a difficult time locating parking near the reataurant, so i recommend to go straight to the parking garage. I was there for 2hrs and parking was $4.00. The wait staff greeted us w a huge smile and immediately took us to our table. Sweet décor, with fancy and comfortable booths all over. Rachel, our server was exceptional, you can tell she has food service experience and is very well informed on both the food and wine menus..not to mention friendly, attentive and courteous. She immediately explained the concept of the restaurant and informed us of the complimentary wine samples for up to 3 different wines per person. She initially brought the Winemaker's Barrel Reserve to try...very generous pour and so delicious..it was a Bordeaux, then the Hawk Red end finally the Cabernet Sauvignon..We recieved a warm pretzel bread w a side of honey mustard..so yummy and soft..we had 2 of those. The menu is extensive and they cater to vegan/vegetarians, so i was pretty happy..i ordered for my entree, the Veggie Burger..oh sooo soo good! I veggie paddy is made from red quinoa, black beans and rolled oats..just wow and its huge too!! It comes w a side of fennel quinoa salad..one gal had the brussel sprouts appetizer, which were charred perfectly and had a delicious sesame sriracha aioli sauce on top and the portion was large. We were all satisfied w our foods! No complaints, just total raves! For desserts, we had a chocolate covered strawberries! Perfecr! Everyone was delighted with their food and overall experience. Will definitely be returning soon!"
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",11/25/2009,$$,4,Joey’s,"Located in the middle of semi-gritty yet artsy design district, Joey's is a small 'upscale' yet laid-back Italian restaurant...perfect for a business lunch or simply a lunch date. Waiters in red are attentive and take initiative, we had breadcrumbs on our table and one of the bus boy wiped it clean so we could resume hand-fondling tabletop!  The bossman came by to make sure we are taken care of when the lunch crowd trickled in. Food was thoughtfully prepared. Soup of the day was mushroom soup (vegan, no cream used but still creamy. Pureed consistency), served with olive oil drizzled in a smiley face. I recommend eating it with the bread; feel free to ask for more if you run out! Papardelle with crabmeat and mushroom was creamy yet subtle. Trofie (little corkscrew pasta) with meat sauce - WIN! Portions were huge for lunch, there was leftovers for dinner!,Soup - $5,Entrees- $15 each,I would come back here if I am in the area...enjoy! ,Tip-bits:,Street parking available right outside Joey's,Lunch menu available with decent portions,Accommodations for big groups gladly made"
"2506 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",1/1/2015,$$,3,Joey’s,"Food was good! Dined with 4 teenagers, 1 vegan, & 1 pescetarian! There was something for everyone!  Only caveat:  Service was lacking.  Was seated immediately, which was a plus, but waiter took his time to serve us water, didn't say hello, not very pleasant(young guy).  Waitress that took the order, nice/friendly, but overwhelmed by the crowd(NYE during the day).  She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. Had to wave down someone to get us more water. Had to ask for the bill, then waited forever for her to bring it, then pick it up!  It's a small venue, the place was packed quickly, but it was surprisingly & refreshingly quiet.  We could actually hear ourselves in conversation!"

"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",8/3/2016,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,Mister Block was really cool and situated in a little corner of wynwood. If you aren't looking you might miss it. The decor is trendy and there is plenty of outdoor seating. They also have lots of vegan pastries to choose from. The coffee was quick and delicious and presented in a cute mr block cup. Definitely will be back!

"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",10/5/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"FUFI is a hip, fresh and affordable restaurant. Their happy hour (Monday- Friday from 4pm-7pm) is the most amazing deal I have yet to receive in Miami. You receive two homemade baked (not fried!) empanadas and one drink of your choice for 7$ total. I ordered a special eggplant curry empanada and a spinach mozzarella empanada. Both were delicious. The sangria I ordered was not to my liking, but it was a very generous drink portion, and came with an edible flower! I also split the vegan pizza and substituted mozzarella for the vegan cheese. My friend who shared it with me is huge meat eater, and even he loved it. The service at Fufi was great, and we received our food with a reasonable wait time. The restaurant isn't close to my neighborhood, but I definitely plan to be back, likely for happy hour"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/4/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Love their empanadas and this small little neighborhood joint in Buena vista. Fufi is always here and very welcoming. My favorite is the ""beef"" garden. How can something vegan be so good! To die for!"

Argentine-style empanadas? Yay! Vegan options? Omg! They completely had me before I stepped foot in the restaurant. I even made the drive down all the way from Ft Lauderdale. ,When I first arrived, the bartender/server was quite kind and very attentive. I placed my order for 2 vegan empanadas, a glass of their Argentine rosé and their soup of the day (potato leek). ,I was promptly served my rosé and it was delish. I couldn't wait to try my food! ,This is where things took a turn for the worst. Folks started to trickle in after me but their food came out before mine. I'm thinking, no biggie. Maybe the vegan empanadas take longer to bake? ,30 minutes go by and I haven't even gotten my soup. I'm a super patient person but at this point I'm a bit concerned. 45 minutes have now gone by and not even a mention of where my food is. My server has not acknowledged how long it's taken and everyone around me is enjoying their soups, appetizers, deserts and empanadas. What happened to my kind, attentive server?,At this point, I'm just hungry :( ,Finally my food comes out all at once. I'm almost finished with my wine. I would have normally ordered another glass but I'm a bit over it at this point. ,I try the soup and it could use a bit more flavor but it'll do. I try one of my empanadas, the vegan chorizo and it was okay. Again, it was missing a bit of something but it will do. ,I then bite into my second empanada and I don't even recognize what I'm eating. ""Oh, this is cheese"" I think to myself. ,*sigh* I'm super sensitive to dairy. ,I call my server over who is confused as to how this could happen. She assures me that she put in the right order (I completely believe her) and that there was a mixup with the kitchen. ,She kindly did not charge me for my empanada and gave me a discount on the wine. ,There seems to be other diners who have had this problem so I think this is something that Fufi should look into just a bit more. ,This place has the potential to be phenomenal but I just can't give it more than 3 stars after such a long wait for food I couldn't even eat. ,+1 for the private parking behind the restaurant."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/29/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Ordered two vegan pizzas for my birthday, they sounded really good and looked even better when they arrived. Only problem is that BOTH pies weren't cut, at all. We literally had to use my plastic cake knife and a butter knife to cut the pies. Wish they tasted better for all the hard work we put into cutting them!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Where do I start?! This place is amazing. I've been coming here for two years and I have only seen great growth. The hospitality and atmosphere is just warm and inviting. Florencia's empanadas are delicious and huge in variety, i am vegan and she has so many vegan options. You can't go wrong with anything it's all so delicious and nourishing. They even have a vegan apple empanada coconut milk ice cream dessert. I mean you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have a great happy hour 4-7 pm two empanadas and a drink. Mexican pizza is delicious. Just try it for yourself you'll love it!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/3/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Nicely welcomed our party of 8 without a reservation. Fufi was amazingly nice and explain the menu and history of the business. I got the lunch special of salad, soup, and chicken and beef empanadas. I loved the salad dressing and the lentil soup, but the empanadas were amazing! They have vegan, vegetarian, and meat options. The dough was crispy and the filling tasted great. Highly recommend!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"We came right as they opened on a Monday, so the place was very clean and the one employee that was working the front of house was extremely polite. We ordered one of each of the vegan empanadas, along with the vegan Mexican pizza. It took almost an hour to receive our food, there were also people waiting pretty long at the bar to pick up to-go orders. The mexican pizza was delicious, my only ""complaint"" would be the vegan cheese they use doesn't melt so it was falling off and quite messy to eat. The garden and beef garden empanadas were the best, so flavorful and piping hot. The curry empanada wasn't bad, just a bit bland. We used a bit of their hot sauce on everything though, which were so spicy and tasty, but even they didn't redeem the curry flavor. Our chorizo empanada came out last, yet it was a bit cold inside. The flavor was also blah, like a can of tomatoey beans inside dough, but my boyfriend actually liked it. But the crust itself on all the empanadas was spot on, perfectly crispy and delicious. They are also small, but not too pricey. I wish we got to try the apple pie dessert, but we were scared it would add another half hour to our stay. Overall, it was a cute small restaurant with lots of vegan options and great service, we will go again on our next trip to Miami."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/5/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I took my son's aunt there for her birthday - specifically for their vegan options. We were welcomed warmly by the owner and she really went above and beyond making my sister in law feel special on her birthday. Created  a special vegan birthday creation empanada just for her. ,We ordered the steak, bacon/Brie/date, and curried eggplant empanadas and they were all fantastic. We also got the Gaia vegan pizza which was just as delicious and berry guacamole. Chicken tacos were ordered for my son - and although he gobbled them up, I honestly would have just ordered the chicken empanadas instead since it's the same filling.,It was a great experience with options for both vegans and meat eaters to enjoy, and the owner was a joy to chat with."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",12/27/2017,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,"Gotta hand it to Fufi. In this culinary wasteland called Miami, they're really trying to do their best for us vegans.,The empanadas here really hit the spot. Just don't catch them on a sloppy day or they'll be cold on the inside. Hit or miss I'd say. The waitresses also tend to confuse what's vegan and what isn't.,I've tried some other stuff on the menu and just like most other vegan options in Miami, it's a sad substitute that ""gets the job done"" for most people. But it's still expensive and bland.,Good enough."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/10/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"I stopped by Fufi because I heard they had vegan options on their menu. That's an understatement - they have so many options for every craving and I was shocked at how many off menu items they had when I mentioned I was vegan. The service here may actually be the best experience I've had in Miami and the owners are so welcoming you'll feel like family.  List of absolute must try items:,Mushroom empanadas - mixture of three different types of mushrooms with garlic and onions (vegan),Vegan beef empanadas - vegan beef crumbles, peppers and onions with a special chipotle sauce on the side,Gaia vegan pizza - vegan mozzarella, roasted eggplant, onions, peppers, arugula and balsamic drizzle,Vegan apple empanadas with a side of vegan vanilla ice cream - don't be alarmed if a tear falls from your eye when you taste it"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,I love this place. I've only been twice. But each time the food is so so good. The vegan chorizo pizza and the vegan empanadas are beyond. The owner is so cute and the spot itself feels warm & cozy. A must try and repeat!
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,My son and I ate vegan today. We had berry guacamole and pizza. My son is helping me embrace this vegan lifestyle. He hasn't said no trying anything yet and he actually asked to come back to this restaraunt. Great job
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",6/21/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Yaaas yaaas yaaas! I don't know why I waited so long to come here!! Lots of vegetarian and vegan options! Empanadas are delish! Come from 4-7 for happy hour! 2 empanadas and a drink for $7! Friendly, aesthetically pleasing, cozy and good food! Will def become my go to spot."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/29/2017,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Wow. What an amazing place. I loved everything from the decor, to the vibe. But let me tell you about the food. We took the owner's recommendations and had their signature empanadas that are made in a wood burning oven. To die for!! We had a delicious coconut butternutsquash soup. We also had blackened grilled fish tacos that were bomb. They have an amazing vegan & vegetarian selection. The owner Fufi is super passionate about everything in her restaurant and it showed. This is definitely our new spot in Miami. 5 star!!"
"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/18/2018,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,"I came to try this little coffee shop out and I got to say I truly enjoyed myself. I came to do some work and the ladies were lovely and kind. They make you feel very welcomed. They truly gave me the ""Wynwood"" vibe. I ordered just a basic hazelnut latte with coconut milk and it hit the spot. They have plenty of drinks they offer. Also my fellow vegan friends they have food for us too! They also offer free phone charging outside of the front door. It's a little hidden off the main st but it's perfect to have a little hideaway spot. Thank you! This place is definitely a gem."
"2621 NW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/1/2017,$,5,Mister Block Cafe,"So Ive been around Wynwood block and I'm sad that I didn't come to Mister Block Cafe sooner. I heard about their vegan icecream sandwiches so I decided to come here instead of Panther.,Wow their coffee was great! I got the tap cold brew coffee, and he put hazelnut in mines. The coffee tap is right next to the register so I got to see how it bubbled. I loved it! My friend ordered the iced matcha latte, and that tasted amazing too.,Also- they do coffee ripple which is foam designs which can be customized. It was such a different and cool addition. I kinda just wanted to keep it and never drink it.,Oh! To get back to the icecream sandwich that brought me here. The vegan flavor was vanilla rice flavor, almonds, sandwiched in chocolate chip almond cookies. It was really really good. ,Seriously guys, come here. Its worth it."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/7/2018,$$,3,Fufi Restaurant,The restaurant is very hippy like and very casual. I think it's a little to pricey for the type of food. I didn't like my vegan pizza meanly because it was way to greasy for my liking and it didn't have a lot of flavor. I wouldn't go back there. The service was nice
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",7/10/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"Oh my oh my oh my the Vegan options abound at this amazing eatery! Let's start with the  delicious Malbec pairing with the berry guacamole which is so unique and delightful!! Guac with pomegranate and dried cranberries...sooo much more amazing than you would think!! We ordered ALL of the vegan empanadas and the faves were the Chorizo and the Beef Garden but my god all were fabulous!! ,Service is amazing. She is letting us just chill through this crazy thunderstorm. P.s. parking is in back off 46th Street!!! Come and try you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Vegan empanadas are great, just be sure to double check that they give you the vegan version!"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/9/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"I was looking for a healthyish dish after one of my occasional gym jaunts, and was drawn to Fufi - I'm going to sound like our orange hued leader - but by a cute girl who was noshing outside as I drove by. I did chat with her, found she was not an employee and even (gasp) vegan. But you guys should definitely hire her for marketing =),As noted, they have outside seating and I learned they are dog friendly, so Princess Luna will make a visit sometime.,But anyway, back to my dinner. Fufi's has a menu with broad appeal to both vegans and omnivores. Trying to balance both worlds, I ordered their taco salad (with added chicken of course). You know I like my food seasoned and customized, and I wasn't disadppointed. For one, they took out the avocado (not allergic, just OCD against it). The cilantro dressing was rich and tasty without being overwhelming,  and there was plenty of cheese and tomatoes.,Me being me, despite the gym, ordered their apple pie (though I customized out the ice cream). This deliciousness has a thin crust, plenty of apples and nuts- see, fruits - and a light cinnamon taste. It's definitely a good close to my meal."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/1/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Fufi's is great for everyone. They have meat options as well as plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. If you decide to eat here I suggest the empanadas. That's what they are known for and they are excellent! (I ordered the pizza once, it wasn't bad but like I said stick to the empanadas). ,Fufi's is a small and adorable cafe located in Buena vista right next to Lemoni cafe. The owner is Argentinean and prides herself in making great empanadas. All of the vegan empanadas are delicious and she will test different flavors adding new ones to the menu which always keeps things infesting. My favorite is the garden meat (she uses the ground meat from Atlas) and the chorizo and bean. Other flavors include, eggplant curry, creamy corn, mushroom and goat cheese and many more. ,In addition to empanadas, she also serves tacos, pizza and apps. Their soup of the day is always vegetarian friendly and each time more delicious than the last. ,I recommend ordering a cup of the daily soup, a few empanadas and an Argentinean wine. Then sit back and enjoy yourself. ,P.s I took one star off only because almost every time my empanada order gets mixed up. Although they do fix my order, it's happened several times.,But I come back anyway !,Tips:,Yelp check in offer- one free empanada ,happy hour special. 2 empanadas and a drink for 7$. ,Outdoor seating available,Dog friendly"
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",5/6/2018,$$,5,Fufi Restaurant,"This is a great little hidden spot! The service was friendly and they made my friend and I feel really welcome. The decor was very quaint with a lot of beautiful plant life around the restaurant. It isn't very big but it is very comfortable and feels a bit more intimate that way. It is a bit pricey but quite worth it for the quality ingredients. The restaurant is also vegan and gluten free friendly, with clear markings on the menu listings.  ,Their empanadas are definitely what first attracted me to try them but other selections, such as tacos and pizza, are also great choices. ,The caramelized onion, mushroom and goat cheese empanada was listed as a ""people's favorite"", and I can see why! The flavors blended together perfectly. The eggplant curry empanada was also very rich in spices and flavor. We also enjoyed the berry guacamole; it was a combination I had never thought to try but the flavor contrast worked so so well together! A great start to our meal already. ,For my entrée I had the fungi pizza, containing mozzarella, truffle oil and several types of mushroom. It felt very sophisticated compared to your typical pie. It was not too oily and the mushrooms were cooked so they were flavorful and soft. Every option for pizza was very unique and I love the different spin they put on this area of their dishes. It turns an option that can easily be one dimensional and boring into something exciting with depth. ,For dessert I had the homemade tiramisu. It was creamy and delicious, while still not being too heavy. Cutting into it with the spoon was so easy and oh so satisfying. We were also pleasantly surprised with a sparkler and candle for our little birthday celebration! ,It was all very sweet and I definitely hope to return soon!! Quality ingredients and a great environment. Fufi easily earns 5 stars from me."
"4600 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",2/19/2018,$$,4,Fufi Restaurant,"Mushrooms, caramelized onions and goat cheese is my favorite empanada! Pizzas are delicious and vegans have many options to try.,Great atmosphere, inside and outside, although a bit noisy."
"265 Aragon Ave, Miami, FL 33134",1/12/2017,$$,5,Books & Books Café by Chef Allen,"I have probably been here 1,000 times. Other than my own kitchen table, the courtyard café at Books & Books is the place I feel most at home. They always have vegan options on the menu, which is much appreciated! I know I can get what I need here: plant-based meals and cordial service in a serene atmosphere surrounded by great books. Diverse author events. Respectful clientele. Music in the courtyard on Friday and Saturday nights is a truly special experience. Dog friendly (I almost always bring my terrier)!"
"265 Aragon Ave, Miami, FL 33134",4/4/2016,$$,4,Books & Books Café by Chef Allen,"Sophisticated light lunch menu that includes lots of vegan choices.  ,Nice dining inside and outside-great service surrounded by Miami's premier independent bookshop.,I like this place-particularly because they sell both of my books ""Make it Your Own Law Firm"" and ""Sara Rose Kid Lawyer."",It's just a short walk from my Coral Gables personal injury law firm so I frequent this place often. Today we had a vegan vegetable and mushroom soup and a turkey wrap. Both were excellent.,Nice selection of herbal teas and coffees and desserts as well."
"26 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33130",4/29/2018,$$$,4,Sushiato,"I had miso soup, seaweed salad and the vegan roll to go. They had my order ready when I picked up but I gave this one 4 stars based on value. My bill was $25 for these items and I felt that was a bit high. The restaurant is very nicely done inside, I will try it again."
"12590 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",1/19/2018,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"Pincho Factory, no matter the location, always delivers! Each and every food item is a must-have. They are most popularly known for their Toston burger, but I love the Toston chicken sandwich with queso frito added the most. You can't go wrong with anything though. They are also vegan and vegetarian friendly with their veggie burgers or the rice bowls they have in a myriad of flavors (packed with plenty of veggies). I love the chimichurri bowl with chicken! Packed with bold flavor and the chicken is cooked just right. ,This location is one of the most recent that opened and they are consistent in terms of food quality and service. I love it here and highly recommend coming by for a burger or one of their rice bowls. ,You can also choose to buy sides separately. The tater tots are a huge hit (with good reason) and I suggest trying it with their cilantro aioli sauce vs the Apple butter it comes with. You won't regret it!"
"5829 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",3/3/2017,$$,3,Tacocraft Taqueria & Tequila Bar,The pork taco. Has no flavor. They need a better selection of hot sauce. Need to bring the Diablo or ghost pepper sauce w.e it's called back. It has a good aesthetic. The seats are uncomfortable. Guac is pretty great. Quesadillas are good. The waiters.. ARE ALRIGHT. Maybe the one I got just gave me attitude?? Or was having a bad day?? Idk. W.e the manager is really nice tho. Found a tag of an avocado in my food. That kinda annoyed me for obvious reasons. I've gone a couple times so I'd say it's worth to try. Also had the guac with the crickets so it's unique lol  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options.

For all my vegans or plant based food lovers, Tacocraft cooks up a delicious sweet potato, kale, sautéed onions, and beans taco that is absolutely yummy! If you decide to arrive for Sunday brunch (Unlimited mimosas and sangria ladies!) the vegan taco is not on the brunch menu but you may request it with your waiter.  Great ambience to hang out with friends but be warned it does get busy and seating his limited so early bird gets the worm."
"5829 SW 73rd St, South Miami, FL 33143",5/29/2017,$$,5,Tacocraft Taqueria & Tequila Bar,"Great vegan and vegetarian options.  The Kale & Sweet Potato tacos were amazing, as were the mushroom confit (Exotic Shroom) tacos.  The guac was good.  No complaints.  I found another Mexican spot and will definitely be back."

Their tacos are very popular in this area of Miami, and there are vegan and vegetarian options on the menu (there's a tofu taco option!). ,Although I've only been here once, I definitely will be coming back. Good service, friendly servers, delicious food, vegan/vegetarian options, and great margaritas and mojitos. And strong. ;),The best day to come is Tuesday, but I'm sure it's good any day of the week."

Got a chicken salad wrap (more flexitarian for today) and it was awesome!! Also got a dancing princess smoothie that is Delish  and I'm really not a smoothie person. Shannon is great! Never stopped working and cleaning the whole time I was here and let me taste a smoothie she was making for someone else and let them taste the one she made for me. Great way to bring us all back for more because both smoothies were pretty awesome.,I'm feeling amazing already  great choice and will become my new go-to for healthy options. Greatly needed around these parts too."

Kendall doesn't have a lot of healthy or ""vegan"" options so I went to Giardino and realized how ridiculously over priced they are for what they offer and left. In my search I came across this awesome place and was impressed by their price, variety, and veggie selection. I will most definitely be returning to this establishment. So grateful that healthier and affordable ""fast food"" options are opening in Kendall."

Lol.  That being said, if you don't know Spanish you might have a problem ordering here .  We ended up getting the Sarussi special for the kids.  I had the yuca fries which were pretty tasty .  My son also had a milkshake.  He said the milkshake was great!"
"2504 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/12/2018,$$,4,Bugatti Restaurant,"Very authentic restaurant. It's very clean. The employees are kind, patient, and accommodating. The menu is very small and there are no vegetarian options on the menu (other than salad). As a vegan I was able to eat: the bread with olive oil, the Bugatti insalade (no modifications needed), and the waiter asked the chef to make me pasta with olive oil, garlic, and the veggies of the day (I had spaghetti- some of their pastas are made with egg, so ask). Their wine menu takes up half of the menu, which was nice in my opinion. I also finished my meal with a shot of espresso. The food was tasty, there just weren't many entree options that didn't have meat in them."

"11327 South Dixie Hwy, Pinecrest, FL 33156",7/20/2018,$$,3,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,"I liked that this place offered a lot of veggie options for vegans/vegetarians, but I'm not sure that I would go here again because the menu is (understandably) catered to a meat loving crowd. ,I ordered the cold spicy tofu and kimchi as starters. The topping on the tofu had a nice crunch to it and was the best thing I had that night. The kimchi tasted like kimchi you can buy in jar from a grocery store. It was sour (which is okay and preferred), but lacked the true color and taste of the red paper paste that you get from fresh kimchi.,I also ordered the spinach and garlic pouch and the mushroom pouch to put on the grill. I could barely taste the garlic in the spinach and the mushrooms just tasted like boiled mushrooms. ,I'm not going to give this place a one-star rating because their veggies are subpar. I knew what I was getting into and enjoyed the selection they offer for non-meat eaters. Not sure how much the restaurant can change the menu because it is a chain, but better veggie sides and preparation would make this place more enjoyable."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",12/11/2013,$$,3,The Honey Tree,"the tomato avocado salad is amazing. Try any of the shakes delicious and filing. as some of the food is not very filling since its all vegan. the lentils were very good also. was able to shop for some organic products while i was there. great shop, great service."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/20/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Best healthy food option in the neighborhood and usually packed at lunchtime as they offer homemade vegan dishes and have inside seating available.  A little pricey as i usually spend between $10-15 for lunch and a drink, but well worth it.  They also have everything under the sun to whole food multi-vitamins, raw chocolate, organic juices, books on healthy lifestyles, and even a talented musician comes in and plays on certains days for the lunch crowd.  They're also very informative and helpful with any questions you may have."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/18/2014,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"I had the vegan chicken empanada, good with their hot sauce.  I also had their pasta.  It tasted fresh, great marinara sauce, but it was microwaved.  That machine should not be in a health food store.  Overall good experience.  I'll be back.  $10"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/6/2011,$$,5,The Honey Tree,With not too many vegetarian places around The Honey Tree is a gem. Go for lunch or even just to grab a few healthy snacks. They have vegan cookies and other baked goods that Taste great. Great tasting lunches and a selection of healthy drinks. Live healthy.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/9/2009,$$,4,The Honey Tree,Lunch: around noon (12:30-3:30) but they also save leftover if you run too early or late. Food tasts realy fresh and amazing. Great cakes (some are vegan) and a nice place to buy food and more healthy product.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/20/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Every time I am in this area, I always try to stop here for lunch.  It opens around Noon and they serve lunch until they run out, which is by 2pm.  They have a variety of healthy soups, salads, and main courses that are prepared by the owner and his family, on site, daily.  You go to the counter and tell them what you want and the amount you want.  I suggest you try a variety of dishes.  Then they weight your plate and that is what you pay.  It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for - a great, home cooked, healthy lunch.  There are several tables inside for dining.  It can get pretty busy around lunchtime.  I wish they had outdoor seating as well.  They also sell a variety of bottled drinks, healthy organic grocery items, organic lotions, and aromatherapy items.  It is much more personalized than Whole Foods and with a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to eat clean, vegetarian, or vegan."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/8/2011,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Healthy, homemade vegan cuisine at its best. I love that they have different options, almost in a cafeteria-style line, available on weekdays. If only they could start offering dinner, I would certainly come back here more often! ,The store itself is very small, better to take the food to go, and offers only a minimal amount of grocery items. ,Great place for a quick office lunch to go."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",4/28/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,Totally recommend this vegan haven. Or anyone that cares about ingredients or just good food. Friendly staff and the owner is more than likely always there. Not enough seating during busy lunch time hours and not enough parking. But well worth the wait!

"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/30/2013,$$,5,The Honey Tree,My favorite place for a lunch break. A vegans dream. Me and my boyfriend have been coming here for years the service is amazing and it is the nicest ambiance for a regular locals spot. I love my honey tree
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/17/2012,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Call me stupid,  but I had no idea this place was a Vegan/Vegetarian health market. ,""STUPID!"",I was looking for a detox after consuming a week's worth of Quaker cereal. ,Unfortunately for me, I forgot I was living in Miami, where lots of folks take care of themselves, thus juicing/detoxes were to no avail. ,What kind of loser buys detoxes?,*raises hand*,Things continued to get gradually worse as I made the fatal mistake of asking if they sold Meat and/or Dairy products. The store clerk emerged in vitriol --- a blank stare --- I thought I was going to be hanged on 'The Honey Tree' (wherever it's hidden).,There's a counter towards the back where they make juices and homemade-vegan food, plus a small area where you can sit, chat, and have bite of some of their delicacies.,I had a portion of their lasagna --- wait that has dairy, what?,Okay, it wasn't lasagna.,What tasted like lasagna was actually just zucchini, tomato sauce, and roasted peppers.  ,These Vegans really do well in duping the uninformed."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/1/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"My rating is based just on the food and juice bar, as the other items I find expensive.  For the lunch bar, the food is fairly priced, fresh and delicious.  Most places in Miami that offer healthy vegan and vegetarian food are not so gourmet and usually cost your whole weeks income.  Loving the Honey Tree right now for a day when I want to go get some good wholesome food and stay under $8 usually.  They change the menu daily so there is always a new dish to try, and huge selection of juices and smoothies to keep you from getting bored."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",3/19/2018,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Best Vegan food in Miami.  Owner holding strong to Local products and being in business for 23 plus years.,Support Local and be the change we want to see in Miami!!!,they just got a new Alkaline Water disperser that is so promising and very affordable!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Lunch buffet is reasonably priced and there is alot to choose from. The food is in the back of the store and upfront they sell vegan products like soap, shampoo etc. I didn't buy anything from the store but I'd go back based off the food."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",7/7/2017,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a hidden gem, especially for vegetarians and vegans, although everyone will enjoy the food here. The Honey Tree is a small natural food store with a cafe in the back offering daily made vegetarian and vegan specialties. ,I went on a Wednesday, which luckily is lasagna day at the Honey Tree. They had two types of lasagnas - regular with vegetarian ""beef,"" and gluten free with vegan cheese. Both were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. They also have tons of other food options daily, as well as a smoothie bar. ,My favorite part is that they have a different vegan cake every day, and they're all delicious. Sometimes I go just to pick up a slice!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",5/4/2018,$$,4,The Honey Tree,"Delicious vegan fresh food sold by the pound! I was there for lunch and had experienced their daily buffet! :) I had a dish full of food including veggie rice, asparagus, kale, potatoes with spinach, veggie quesadilla, shaved Brussels sprouts, and avocado salad ($13.32).  Also, i added a veggie spring roll ($3.50) for lunch. For dessert, I took a fruit salad with almond cluster to go which was delicious ($6.99). The fruita included papaya, mango, starfruit, kiwi, and pineapple. I ate so much and was definitely satisfied! Will most definitely come back! Also! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Finally, parking is freeeee which is a nice perk!"
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",8/3/2018,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"the honey tree has closed. this is a tragedy. best lunch place for vegan food. again, this is a major tragedy."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",10/11/2017,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"I'm not a vegan but I love fresh delicious vegan food which is exactly what I get here 3 days a week after hot yoga down the block. They have a limited amount, lunch only so If your interested don't come late afternoon or you'll be disappointed.  I feel like I'm really feeding my body well when I'm here. Yummy too."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",2/4/2016,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"Food is exquisitely fresh, vegan, and delicious.  They bring in prepared salads, quiches, and soups at around 11:30 AM, and they serve until it runs out.  You stand at the counter and point to which you would like to try, and they scoop it onto a plate and weigh it.  They often sell out of items like the tofu-spinach quiche because folks place phone orders to reserve a slice (sooo good!  Don't slam tofu quiche until you try it!).,I had roasted butternut squash, roasted broccolini, marinated portobello slices, a competent tomato/avocado salsa, and a cucumber-mint salad with chick peas.  My friend let me taste the quiche and I ended up eating half of it.  We finished the meal by splitting a fresh vegan, gluten-free strawberry cake, and it was soft, sweet, and pretty.,They also make juices and smoothies and have lots of vegan baked goodies that look scrumptious.  Did not shop the market, but it looks pretty well stocked.,The genuine, tie-dyed hippie staff are extremely nice and quirky.  Stay away if you're wearing Lululemon and a sneer.  The price for lunch was certainly more expensive than a burger and fries- but this is  real honest cooking served with warmth.  You'll leave feeling nourished, body and soul."
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/10/2015,$$,5,The Honey Tree,If I can come here everyday I would. I love this little place. At first I never knew about the warm food that's for lunch on a daily basis. All vegan and vegetarian. Service is so nice and friendly. Honey tree is all in one. Its a health/organic mini market. Love love love this place.
"5138 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33137",11/18/2014,$$,5,The Honey Tree,"This is a great place to stop in for supplements or speciality vegan food items (e.g nutritional yeast) if you don't have time to go all the way to Whole Foods.  I was impressed by the variety of vitamins and supplements for a small store.  I also picked up some nutritional yeast, chia seeds, an vegan gravy packets while I was there.  I can't wait to go back and try the smoothies and food at the cafe."
"12560 SW 88th St, Miami, FL 33186",7/30/2016,$,3,Jamrock Cuisine,Let me just say this review is a bit skewed because I do not eat meat. They only have 2 plates curry tofu & jerk tofu and no veggie patties available that day. I tried the jerk tofu chop. The rice and peas & salad were good but the tofu had no texture. I have eaten tofu prepared all kind of ways but this was just the block of tofu straight out the package. Maybe if I ate all the other plates with meat my rate would be higher. If you are vegan/vegetarian this is not your place.
"1040 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132",6/13/2018,$$,5,Almalibre Açaí Bar,I CRAVE their vegan burgers on a weekly basis. A serious must!! With their Granpa sauce (a VEGAN version of Big Mac sauce) which is to drool for. Love love love the vegan burgers so much I haven't gotten around to try anything else lol but I will!
"1040 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132",6/28/2018,$$,5,Almalibre Açaí Bar,"Place is an absolute gem. It has a chill theme and healthy vegan vibe, High quality ingredients, unbelievable açaí bowl ( Everest climber is my favorite). I love their chicken quesadillas and thin crust margarita pizza and their Mia and other bowls are top shelf."
"1201 Coral Way, Miami, FL 33145",7/24/2016,$$,5,Mykonos Greek Restaurant,"Great selection of vegan dishes plus all the traditional Greek entrees that we all love. Friendly staff, great food and awesome location make this a must for everyone."
"5850 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",8/15/2015,$$,5,Taste Buds of India,"This place blew my taste buds of miami away. I think I might just move to India after such a dining experience (or possibly into this place's kitchen). I mean everything hit the spot. I came in hungry and left stuffed off of all vegan dishes with even a box to go. The bismati rice was cooked to perfection and the little fennel candies at the door was icing on the cake. ,It's new so if there's not too many people in the establishment,  don't let that fool you. They have another successful restaurant in coral Springs. ,I can't wait to come back...indian food is officially my favorite type of food nowadays... Thanks TBOI"
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",10/9/2017,$$,4,Cocowhip,"Yummy vegan froyo. Hailing all the way from Australia, this chain found its way to Brickell and I'm glad it did. I liked their original and chocolate flavors, so I was really excited when they said they'd be rotating the chocolate out the next week for matcha. But after coming back a few times and it was still chocolate, I lost faith and the post-run habit (probably for the better though considering one bowl will easily set you back $10). Also considering its location inside an eatery with 100 Montaditos (Spanish tapas place) and Kai (poke and ceviche place), it's a convenient dessert spot to treat yourself every now and then."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",12/10/2016,$$,3,Cocowhip,"Located inside the 100 montaditos, cocowhip is a small yogurt option with about six topping options. Although its a little steep in pricing. We paid $18 for two yogurts with about 2 toppings each. The yogurts are vegan so they melt quickly. The consistency isn't as thick as you'd expect. ,The nice part is that there is outdoor seating, bench style and high tops. They also have flat screens tvs; you can watch your sports game. Parking is hard to come by, I parked in the garage at the building next door on se 12 terr."
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",6/8/2018,$$,4,Cocowhip,Update - went again to find out the carrot cake isn't  vegan as was previously told on countless occasions. Very disappointing and irresponsible of the staff. I didn't give a low rating because the staff member who went in the back to ensure it was not when we asked him for the vegan carrot cake was very apologetic when he found out we use to buy the carrot cake because one of the staff told us it was vegan. He offered us a free vegan banana muffin as an apology. Also the cocowhip is still very good and highly recommend it.
"1401 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131",9/15/2017,$$,3,Cocowhip,"We came here with a friend - after giving into our late night cravings - not realizing it was a vegan, gluten and dairy free kind of place. According to their menu CocoWhip is made with Coconut Water, Organic Bio-Fermented Coconut Powder & Vegetable Sourced stabilizers. There's five CocoWhip variants: Original Coconut, Cacao Bliss, Super Berry, Minty Matcha, African Mango & Turmeric. The Original CocoWhip (their most popular) is more on the neutral side but I added some fudgy brownie bites. If brownies is not your thing they do have a few additional toppings and syrups to choose from. CocoWhip has a very light coco taste (which will go well with any of their toppings), texture was also light, not creamy and had no consistency related to pudding or yogurt. I thought it was quite refreshing. I would like to try their Cacao next time but as for their service, it was very slow. Price wise it was steep (about $6) considering the small size of the cup. My order was made on the spot but my friend ordered the Acai bowl (she did not like the texture) which took about 15 minutes to make! I am willing to give this place another go if I happen to be near-by. Just keep in mind that aside from their soft serve there's not a lot of other dessert choices. And I do agree with a fellow Yelper that my dessert also looked nowhere near what they advertise on their social media. CocoWhip is inside a small section of another restaurant. You have indoor seating and there's also a cute and well lit outdoor seating area. Luckily for us the weather outside was perfect that evening. Too bad my friend didn't enjoy her dessert but I sure enjoyed mine. Hope they're faster with their service next time."
"7950 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33144",9/24/2017,$$,5,Punjab Indian Cafe,Love this place. It's a hidden gem and I'm so glad we found it. It's really authentic and the owner/chef is super nice and can make any dish vegan.
"7950 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33144",8/13/2017,$$,5,Punjab Indian Cafe,Food and service was very attentive. Good vibe and the food was amazing. Me and my gf had the vegetable makhani. So yummy and vegan/vegetarian friendly which was great for us. Would definitely come back!
"7950 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33144",2/11/2018,$$,5,Punjab Indian Cafe,A little gem tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. Vegan options abound and the coconut ice cream is ridiculous. A must visit if you're in Westchester. We will be back!
"7950 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33144",12/19/2017,$$,5,Punjab Indian Cafe,"Was so impressed with taste of food. Service was amazing. Would highly recommend this restaurant. For a party of five, 3 vegans and 2 chicken eaters. Everyone was very pleased. Also catered to gluten free diet."
"9005 SW 72nd Pl, Miami, FL 33156",10/8/2017,$,5,Lime Fresh Mexican Grill,"I love this place! I was a little worried they wouldn't have any vegan options but they can make anything vegetarian and with a few changes and some guacamole to the mix I had hands down the best bean burrito. Their variety of hot sauces was so amazing I couldn't pick just one. Don't even get me started on the bean and corn salsa! I wanted to take the whole container home. It's a big college student hotspot and a great after school, work, life hangout! With Great food and great hospitality this is my go too Mexican food destination!"
"8841 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33176",2/10/2017,$,5,Gyroville,"I love this place! Everyone in my family loves this place! That's not an easy feat since there are 6 of us, and one is vegan, and another is vegetarian! I wish they had one further south. It's like chipotle, but with Mediterranean food! I rarely get to go since it's all the way in Doral. When I do go the food is great and the portions are big! It's very reasonably priced. The people aren't incredibly friendly, but I don't care. I go for the food, and it's not like you have to tip them. I'd go here every week, if I could!"
"117 SW 107th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",10/15/2017,$,4,La Nonna Italian Restaurant,The food was decent. I'm also a vegan so there wasn't much option....but I was with a party of 3 and everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. I was recommend this place because of their affordable prices for great portions of food.
"1104 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/22/2017,$$,5,Yuzi Yakitori,"This was our first time in Miami, and we found this restaurant on Yelp.  The food is just terrific, and the service was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal--something for dinner everyone!  We have three generations and a vegan, and everyone was happy.  The wait staff is incredible, all the  dishes were superb.  Highly recommend."
"646 SW 109th Ave, Miami, FL 33174",2/5/2018,$$,3,109 Burger Joint,"This place is okay. The veggie black bean burger was yummy, and so were the fries. Not the best, not the worst. Apart from that, they didn't really have many vegan or vegetarian options. I don't even think they had many healthy options at all, from what I recall (I don't remember there being a salad option, but I could be wrong. If there was a salad option, it was probably sub par or I would remember ordering it).,The servers were friendly, but severely understaffed. The wait time is FOOORRREEVVVVEERR (*insert Sandlot gif here*). I'm not exaggerating. I have visited here twice; once with family and another time with friends, and we had to wait about 1-2 hours maybe? Quite a while, especially since neither of those times were especially busy. Well, maybe the second time but not nearly enough for the wait time to be that long. Maybe they've cracked down on the promptness, though, as this was awhile back. ,The parking is pretty bad. It's free, but the spaces are limited. This place is practically designed for students who park across the street or in 109 towers or 4th street commons. ,They do have trivia night, though! I believe they host them on Tuesdays. I've never been, but my brother goes sometimes and he always has fun. ,If you're not a picky eater and don't have a car, then this place is probably great. If you're a health conscious vegetarian or on a diet that isn't Atkin's or have a gas guzzling, carbon Big Foot printing hummer, go elsewhere."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/27/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"I randomly (and happily) stumbled upon Ten Fruits last week on a walk to Bayfront Park. The decor is clean, white, and minimal with facts about healthy foods written all over the walls in a cool newspaper style.  All juices are made from fresh fruits and vegetables with a slow pressed juicer; I learned that this is to retain all of the nutrients that are otherwise lost from the heat and friction of a fast juicer. Juices come in large portions (16 oz) and are bottled with a lid. Ten Fruits also offer salads, Acai power bowls, empanadas, waffles, and quiches, many of which are vegan-friendly. I'm super excited to have found a healthy and delicious place to get my daily serving of fruits and vegetables within walking distance of where I live. I will most definitely be becoming a regular here.,I also hear that Ten Fruits is opening a location in Coral Gables soon!"
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2014,$$,5,Ten Fruits,"So I was at Ten Fruits, dropping a deuce in the men's bathroom, when I noticed that the wallpaper surrounding me were these Wikipedia pages of some the most underrated antioxidants known to man (You know, because Yuppies jusy need to be educated). Anyway, I knew about Acai, I just didn't really how to say it -- now I do. With that said, I was very impressed by my Acai bowl, it was even designed like something out of one of those glossy, colorful Vegan recipe books.,But Ten Fruits is cute; something that Miami is looking to transition into, I think. It's always difficult when you're that one organic/health food place surrounded by a bunch of Cuban sandwiches. This place was legit, though, in all honesty."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/9/2014,$$,4,Ten Fruits,"In a nutshell: it's free wi-fi, vegan/vegetarian-friendly, great place for clean eating in the downtown Miami area.,If you think waffles without copious amounts of butter and syrup is criminal, you were not alone, but the whole wheat waffles here are soft and moist without losing their crisp and are tasty topped with fresh fruits and agave. I had the whole wheat waffle + super smoothie combo, with an almond milk latte.,The guy that saw me looking the menu on his way out must have seen my hangover because he suggested the Green Giant, which I can now say is a certifiable cure! It blends avocado, pineapple, coconut water, vanilla and agave for a tasty drink that hydrates and restores electrolytes.,The coffee was okay, they get their beans from Panther which is a popular gourmet coffee shop in the Wynwood Arts District. Unfortunately the almond milk was over-whipped and actually had it's own texture, which made it really hard to keep drinking. I really think almond milk has too thin of a consistency to be properly whipped, so I probably would have been fine if I had ordered my usual soy latte."
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",7/7/2015,$$,4,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"The place is small, and just what I wanted. It was a yelp find, and I couldn't be happier. They have vegan/vegetarian options, which is fantastic. They have wine, beer & tequila for their Margaritas. Right away, I was enamored with this restaurant. You wouldn't think the food would be so good. But it is, it's a Mexican hole-in-the-wall in the middle of Cuban Westchester. Go, try it, you'll love it."
"9817 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165",12/20/2015,$$,5,El Maguey Taquero Mucho,"Excellent food, and for a vegan very accommodating when I asked for no cheese or sour cream. Only set back which I did not count against them; was the poor girl was running around as the only employee besides the kitchen staff. Very quaint and fairly quiet and intimate for a date night.  It is small so don't be deceived by the first impression."
"143 NE 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33132",1/3/2018,$$,3,Ten Fruits,Ten Fruits has a large selection of vegan salads and other fruit and vegetable forward dishes in addition to the array of smoothies and bowls on offer at the restaurant. I bought a corn salad from the fridge section and it was the perfect balance of acid and spiciness without overpowering any of the ingredients. It made me eager to try other dishes from the shop.
"1547 SW 27th Ave, Miami, FL 33145",3/1/2018,$,5,El Palacio De Los Jugos,"My go to place for fast- home made style authentic Hispanic food. And guárapo that NEVER fails me ! What havent I tried from here... I wonder. Ive even had the sandwiches. The desserts, the fruits, the salads. I LOVE IT ALL. Never really had an issue and I usually share a $12 meal with 3 people and it's very filling. The people who work here are extremely sweet ladies. I'm so glad I just moved 2 minutes from here now I go walking there all the time for a passion fruit juice run. Did I mention... I'm vegan ! But I still love this place and the delicious vegan options they have that are not limited at all compared to other Spanish places where I'm stuck eating rice and beans."
"7919 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",2/28/2018,$$,5,Cake’s Thai Kitchen,The greatest Thai food in Miami. They are SO NICE and have many vegan options. I highly recommend the eggplant chili miso tofu as well as the Chinese broccoli. The Tom Yum and Tom kha soup are both delicious. I could honestly eat this place for breakfast lunch and dinner it is so good!!  For an additional experience ago and it's a little bit hidden and worth it for delivery every single time
"140 NE 39th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/28/2018,$$,5,ITAMAE,"Start off with a fresh tatami small plate, and work your way through the entire menu please - you won't be disappointed. Vegan or gluten allergies? No worries, Chef Fernando always got your back. My favorite dish is the Nikkei Bowl. Favorite sushi is the Lost in translation or the Sansho (creamy a.f.). Pro tip: pair it all with their japanese bubbly sodas."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Recently stopped in here for lunch and the food was delicious! Lots of vegan options and the menu also offers a macro count on each item - so very helpful if you're keto. I got the lemongrass chicken in a collard green wrap and it was one of the best wraps I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/28/2017,$$,5,DIRT,Yum! I'm so happy this opened up in Mary brickell! I have came here every day for the past week and I can't get enough. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade and healthy! I live for the vegan wrap (love the mint) and their tomato soup! I'm super sensitive to sodium but their soup has just the right amount. Portions are huge and the quality is just right for the prices. If you want to only spend $5 go to McDonald's!! Run in and grab a coffee or tea from their coffee bar or walk up and order a healthy organic meal! You won't be disappointed.
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",12/12/2017,$$,3,DIRT,"Love the ambience, healthy food varieties, but wish there were organic options (especially for their eggs). The collard wrap (mai fun vegan wrap) I got was not worth recommending, only part I enjoyed was the sauce. The rest was bland and raw. Don't waste your $5 getting the Adashah as an add on... was advertised as ""amazing"" but honestly more bland than plain polenta. I'll be back to try other things.."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/12/2018,$$,4,DIRT,Decent place with lots of vegan options. Portions are very big. Tomato soup is very yummy :)
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",11/2/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"They did it again!!!! The food is healthy amazing and has vegan options!  Everything is so yummy!  It's also great because everyone remembers your name and says hello!,My favorites are the dirty vegan salad and the poke Bowl with adashah instead of tuna for vegetarians (although their tuna is high quality and I love it!!!!) and you can't forget the coco chia pudding!!!! I can eat it all day plus if you bring the jar back you get a $1 off the next one!,Today Jeff (an owner who is at the register and greeting guests daily) even offered me to try a new sauce with the adashah (which is an amazing vegan thing to replace meat) it looks and tastes like a filling and yummy cornbread almost... ,I promise you it's the best vegan spot you will ever try and if you're not vegan the rest of the menu plus tuna and chicken are high quality organic with no hormones or anything. The flavors are amazing and it's all made fresh!"
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/25/2018,$$,4,DIRT,"It's nice having more healthy options in the area. This place is pretty great for the health conscious and is vegan friendly. ,Pros,Great design,Great options,Local food,Great location,Priced similarly for the area. ,Cons,I would skip the coffee bar if you want something high quality. I came for a latte because I saw they had a La Marzocco machine, which is wonderful if you know how to use it. Makes an incredible espresso. Unfortunately the barista didn't have the knowledge to use the machine to its best. I've lived in several coffee cities like Seattle and am use to getting incresibly amazing coffee. So keep in mind you may not care about that if you are usually happy with Starbucks. If you go to Panther or Eternity, you won't find the coffee very good. The bean isn't bad, but it's all for nothing if no one can use the machine well. ,Service-wise, I was a initially surprised that I wasn't offered a new drink, but I didn't mind paying for a new one. The general manager came by eventually and asked if he could remake the drink but it wasn't much better to be honest. Still very foamy milk for a latte that didn't properly blend into the espresso. He also gave me a free Zak the Baker cookie, which was nice and delicious. I would recommend the business invest in barista training with Panther. The coffee bar is a good idea and will be even more worth it if it's the best thing locals can get in the Brickell area."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",2/22/2018,$$,5,DIRT,Cranberry iced tea is refreshing and made fresh! Matcha pancakes were amazing and vegan :) they guys who work there are super nice!
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",1/10/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"If we had one in Tampa, I'd eat here weekly! Flavorful, interesting vegan/vegetarian options with a nice outdoor area. I'm really liking this Adashah protein, which I've only seen here in Miami."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",10/25/2017,$$,5,DIRT,"Fast and friendly service. Servers are very attentive. Delicious options and I love that it is vegan and omni friendly. The best places are the ones we can all get something.,Update. The prices are great for the portions. The dirty vegan salad was way bigger than what I was expecting for the price. This is my go to spot now."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",7/25/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Let's talk about that Impossible Burger. In the wave of plant-based foods here in Miami, this is by far the most delicious and interesting thing I have experienced. Fairly new to the DIRT menu, it's 100% Vegan and mind-warpingly delicious. It's deliciousness, down to a science. At its center is a vegan patty with amazing texture and maybe even better-than-beef taste -- along with fresh spinach, sliced heirloom tomato, and a perfectly sliced and well placed onion (reminiscent of In-Out-Burger). While still experiencing that primal joy that comes with diving your face into a burger, post meal I walked away with a feel-good stomach, a smile, and maybe even a little bit of that chipotle sauce on my cheek.

I want to try everything off their menu. Lots of paleo, vegan, and vegetarian options to choose from. The interior is definitely ""Instagram worthy"" of you're in to that sort of thing."
"900 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130",6/29/2018,$$,5,DIRT,"Dirt is one of my faves! Dog friendly local restaurant chain with creative healthy cuisine that has plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Also, DIRT offers different meat dishes for the meat lovers! What more could you ask for? ,I first went to DIRT at their original Miami Beach location, and since then I have seen the service and menu improve SIGNIFICANTLY. There are plenty of creative dishes that I haven't even had the chance to try yet, but everything I have ordered from DIRT I have enjoyed. DIRT also provides nutritional info for every dish on their menu (not just calories, but also fat and protein content) so you can make smarter dietary decisions based on your needs. They are very willing and open to accommodations, such as swapping meat or fish for Adashah (a vegan based protein). Adashah is a vegan, nutritious lentil based protein that is made by a local entrepreneur, and it is featured in many of DIRT's dishes. You can even by uncooked adashah from DIRT (sold in their display fridge) so that you can easily cook and customize it at home! I'm a huge fan of adashah, and DIRT is currently the only place I can get it in Brickell (for both cooked and uncooked versions)! ,What I've tried at DIRT Brickell (all were delicious and very filling!) ,Frittata tostada (I got the eggs poached and without sriracha- I can't handle the spice),Clean bowl (subbed turkey bacon for adashah to get a higher protein content, and made the dish vegetarian!),Dirty vegan salad (added adashah for protein) ,Summer poke bowl (sriracha dressing was spicy, so if spicy is hard for you like me, I'd take it off or try something else!) ,Summer adashah plate (surprisingly no customizations for this one!) ,I've also had the açaí bowl here, which wasn't bad, but I'm also picky about these, as I used to work at a smoothie shop that offered marvelous açaí bowls with yummy plenty of different flavors. ,There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at this brickell location. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching in Mary brickell village and has shade. I also really appreciate that DIRT always has complimentary lemon cucumber iced water that is tasty and refreshing! Also, because you order at a counter, you don't have to worry about paying tip at this restaurant!,Dirt has something for everyone, make sure to support your local business and give it a try!"
"266 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/4/2015,$$$,5,Le Provencal,"This place is amazing. Not only is the food extremely authentic, but the stars here are for the staff. It doesn't take an expert of French cuisine to know that French food is probably the least vegetarian friendly food you can think of. I came to this restaurant with my friend and told our server that I'm vegan. She immediately accommodated me and even had the chef come out to ask me what vegetables I like. I ended up eating a beautiful, colorful plate of veggies that were absolutely delicious. My friend had escargot and LOVED it. This place is truly wonderful."

When I first moved to the urban farm where I live right down the street from B&M, I was looking for an inexpensive take-out spot...with vegan and pescaterian options. My neighbors directed me to B&M and it remains my favorite Caribbean food source in Miami.,Experience: Delicious every time. Inexpensive. Fairly fast. Super friendly folks. Try the veggie plate (ask for extra cabbage and pumpkin). The fish stew is also divine.  ,Bottom Line: B&M is one of Miami's hidden gems."

They provide a white dressing which was very tasty which I poured on my wrap.. delish! Also, they offer a ""box lunch"" which includes rice & beans & your choice of protein for $9.  They sell soft drinks & water to ease it all down. Great spot to grab a tasty but quick lunch!"
"50 SW 10th St, Miami, FL 33130",8/1/2018,$$,5,Rice House of Kabob,"Our company ordered catering for about 30 people for 3 events last month. Our staff loved the food... Every last bit was enjoyed and everyone had rave reviews after each event. It was great that the combination of food had something for everyone, whether omnivore or vegan! It was much preferred over the usual sandwiches we typically cater. The ordering process was very easy as well. The staff helped us figure out exactly what we needed and how much. Overall it was a great experience, and we would definitely order again."

"5831 Sunset Dr, Miami, FL 33143",11/17/2017,$$,3,Earth,"I ordered earth for my coworkers and myself for genetic counselor awareness day (we are a genetics department!) I love what earth is doing in providing simple, hassle free, healthy options. One of our physicians is vegan and there were plenty of options available for her as well. I was disappointed because many of the items listed on the menu were unavailable and most of those that were actually delivered were lackluster. The brown soup was bland. The bowls were not very cohesive, and the desserts were not indulgent even when considering the limitations of all vegetable ingredients. Potential to do great things but the items need to be elevated just a little bit. Still glad we didn't order pizza though!"

"7030 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33138",7/31/2017,$,4,Dogma Grill,"First off , gotta say the vegan hot dogs here are still some of the best in town. They stay open semi-late (10pm ish) and food is prepared relatively quickly.My only issue with Dogma Grill is the callous cashier who can't seem to take an order without giving attitude. I ordered something VERY simple, had to repeat myself 3 times and she still got the order wrong at the end with a big side of attitude.At that point I was just annoyed and didn't care for her to try and rectify the order. I'll be back for some delicious hotdogs hoping she'll be in a happier mood."

"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",10/26/2016,$$,5,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"If you want to eat delicious and healthy food, Dr Smood is for you. Helpful staff, nice decor, and quick professional service. At first I wasn't sure that I liked their concept of cashew milk lattes but now they have house made coconut ""mylk"" which is perfect for my morning coffee. My go to items here are the Vegan Smoothie No. 1 (apple, spinich, banana, avodaco, ginger) and the avocado toast (it is simple but healthy and still tastes good). Prices are a little high but the extra money is justified by the food quality."
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",5/15/2016,$$,5,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,Visited Dr. Smood for the first time several weeks ago and fell in love with the concept. Tyler took care of us and he as well as the rest of the team were awesome! Walking into an establishment and seeing just how much pride they all take in their work is awesome. Food is a bit pricey but it's all fresh and vegan (right up my alley).
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",1/20/2018,$$,5,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"My go-to lunch delivery option. Their sandwiches are great, they're made with what they call 'performance breas' which is amazing! My favorite is the vegan one, hummus, pesto, avocado and spinach. Cold pressed juices and smoothies are good too. Nice selection of healthy desserts."
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",3/14/2016,$$,4,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"Trying to eat healthy without sacrificing taste is a catch 22. Luckily, places like Dr.Smood exist. The menu is filled with healthy, vegan friendly, options. Their quality juices, teas, coffee, and food are each created and categorized into six categories: Immune, Energy, General Health, Beauty, Detox, and Super Power. My favorite is Smoody No.2, which is a part of the Super Power family. It has almond milk, orange, pineapple, banana, coconut meat, and chia seeds. It's delicious, nutritious, and filling! Dr.Smood has created a beautifully minimalistic brand - from their logo to the ambience - it's gorgeous and welcoming. They are particularly pricey ($10 for the smoody) but serve quality food in the trendiest of settings!"
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",1/26/2016,$$,5,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"So GooD!! Addicted to their Hawaj smoothie- similar taste to Chai but I think its even better.  Vegan sandwich tasty. Ready made salads, smoothies, and soups! Coffee crunch dessert also very delicious.  ,It is definitely more plant blased than a regular cafe, so maybe some people are not used to that, palate wise (I'm talking to the naysayers on here). But in my opinion, Dr. Smood's takes the gold on flavor. Highly recommend.,Service rocks too- friendly, passionate-they know their stuff."

So many great vegan options. I ordered the avocado toast and a cacao hazelnut bun off the breakfast menu. Large portions and both were so fresh and delicious! They make everything off the menu to order, and they also have a huge selection of packaged goods including fresh salads, desserts and drinks! About 90% of the food available is vegan. I was also able to order a latte with cashew milk. Highly recommend for breakfast or lunch!"

All around an open and welcoming atmosphere, full of a variety of healthy options to choose from. The sandwiches are a good quick bite on the go, as well as the to go salads in the front. The Greek salad has a delicious vegan feta cheese made from cashews that is so good I would eat it by itself. If you're looking for something good, I would definitely go there and check it out."
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",5/20/2017,$$,4,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"Dr. Smood is in all a very healthy spot if you are looking for a healthy conscious meal. Although I must add that it is very pricey. I ordered the vegan panini to share which consisted of very fresh ingredients such as avocado, hummus, tomatoes, spinach, and pesto sauce. Very tasty and although I had only half very filling especially when you accompany it with one of their vegan smoothies or milkshakes. I ordered their strawberry shake; which consisted of almond milk, cashews, coconut oil, strawberry, lucuma, Himalayan salt, and tocotreinols. Mind you this was a 8.95 priced milkshake. I would probably only come here very seldom since it's a bit far and way over priced. I loved their concept. It felt like a library or high end cafe in there. Very clean and I sure  appreciate that !!!"
"5801 Sunset Dr, South Miami, FL 33143",5/24/2018,$$,4,Dr Smood - South Miami Organic Cafe,"Dr. Smood has become one of my favorite cafes. I came in and was in awe with its atmosphere. It's chill vibe alongside the music makes for a pleasant visit. I ordered the vegan sandwich, and was delighted by the flavors. So flavorful without the need of meat. (This is coming from a meat eater) It is a bit pricey, but for the quality you get here at Dr. Smood- you get what you pay for. Everything is made in-house with top ingredients. I also ordered the herbal tea with my meal. From the explanation it sounded much better than it was. It was very mellow. Next time I'll definitely try the matcha latte everyone is raving about."

"10650 NW 41st St, Doral, FL 33178",7/15/2018,$$,5,Divieto Ristorante,"We have been twice.  The first time was to celebrate my daughter's graduation.  This is a wonderful place to celebrate any occasion.  However, I would suggest that if you do so, pick a day and time that is early because it gets crowded on the weekend and any time after 7pm.  Some say the cheese wheel is a gimmick, but I did it and found that it tasted better than the regular Fettuccine Alfredo.  Please tip the person making it.  They work hard making the spectacle a special event.  I had all of the appetizers.  All were wonderful.  Not one complaint with any dinners at the graduation.  Never felt rushed.  The only ""complaint"" that I would add is that they have a rule.  It mirrors a corkage fee.  If you decide to bring in your own cake for a celebration...don't.  They charge a fee for that.  I am putting it out there to avoid an embarrassment for others.  We were going to bring our daughter's vegan cake but decided not to as it was elaborate and would have caused an issue.  Other than that, we will keep coming back as the food and service is outstanding."

Saw this place on HappyCow and booked a reservation simply because I saw they had raw options. I hadn't looked at the menu or even looked up the restaurant. Boy was I BLOWN AWAY! This was the best raw vegan dining experience I will probably ever have. The staff here is exquisite and elegant. The food is portioned very nicely and has such beautiful presentation. Most of the food is sourced locally and is organic. No gluten in house which is amazing! Also the atmosphere of this place is absolutely incredible. I've never been at such a beautiful restaurant. I had such a beautiful experience here and I am so happy I came.
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/19/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Simply....outstanding. The setting is a beautiful zen environment surrounded by water, plants and trees while in the middle of Wynwood. The food is absolutely incredible, vegan or not. I had the celery root lasagne and my husband had the tamale. I honestly don't know which one I liked better! I wanted more of each. The drinks were delicious as well and great service by everyone there. It's not cheap but it's definitely worth every penny!"

Such beautiful presentation and attention to detail on each dish, unique and creative selections, and the taste was five star. Everything is made fresh on site"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/17/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Great food in an excellent setting that both vegans and non vegans can enjoy. I started with the dumpling and the tamale (brunch menu). Both dishes were very good although very small portions. We then had the funghi and the kofte. The funghi was amazing and full of flavor which isn't easy to pull off with a raw cold dish. The kofte was also very good but outshined by the funghi. We then finished off with the papaya cheesecake , which was good, but not excellent and extremely overpriced for the portion. All in all, the food was great."

The portions looked small....no tiny!  Tiny food.  My daughter-in-law and I had the Moroccan bowl, one son had the Banana Leaf Tamale and the other son had  the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja.  I tasted all of them.  All were perfectly spiced and so delicious.  My favorite might have been the Sous Vide Mushroom Ropa Vieja, and the Banana Leaf Tamale is a close second.  I have to talk about the cheese platter we had to start.  The cheeses were more of a pate texture (was a surprise to me, the non vegan) so good and delicious, also the compote but the pickles were a bit strong for me.   We all cleaned our plates and was surprisingly FULL!  WE still had the tiny dessert key lime brulee with the vanilla ice cream because.......we just had too!  Whoo!  They did not disappoint.  Oh my son said the 'Old Fashioned' he ordered was the best he ever had.,Now for the long drive back to Boca Raton, and I thought for sure I will need a little sumtin sumtin to eat when I got home....guess what, I was still satisfied and relishing in what I had just experienced.  This is absolutely the best vegan gastronomic experience I have ever had. Go and enjoy."

From the freshness and great selection of their ingredients to the elegant yet chic presentation of their dishes and drinks this place sets the atmosphere for everyone to relish great healthy dining in a sacred hidden Miami Paradise-like location. Dishes like the harvest dumplings, beet tostada or the handmade cheese board will have your taste buds asking for more . Not to mention their great succulent fusion of flavors covering a wide variety of international dishes like tamales, cacio de funghi, celery root lasagna, sprouted almond falafel or the asian Bowl just to mention a few. ,This is a must try new experience for all vegan and non-vegans to see what is like to dine in a place that doesn't use any animal products in their recipes and serves in decent moderate portions defying the American conception of huge or supersize portions where one stuffs oneself beyond our limits"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/22/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,I'm a carnivore but my best friend is vegan and we had dinner here. Food was surprisingly amazing. I had the banana leaf tamale and it tasted like meat tamale. It was delicious and to know that there wasn't any meat was amazing.

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",3/13/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I was only in Miami for two and a half days and I came to Plant twice. The restaurant is beautiful and secluded making it feel like you are on a Zen retreat. Every single thing that came out was out if this world, order the cheese board and you won't be disappointed. The sweet potato cheesecake was one of the best desserts I've had and it was raw vegan. I think the menu is priced fairly for food that is so obviously cooked with love and exquisite attention to detail. The servers make you feel relaxed and the food comes out at a perfect pace."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/14/2018,$$$,3,Plant Miami,"The ownership changed but the head chef stayed. I love raw vegan food and loved a few specific dishes at this place. Unfortunately they changed the recipes and missed! The grounds are as beautiful as ever, the service very good and the servers knowledgeable about every dish. I hope they get it right soon as we don't have many choices for this sort of food around here. We stopped for lunch. Definitely too expensive for veggie dishes, over priced for sure!!! We had 3 dishes (small quantity) shared by 2 of us and the bill was nearly $100 without any drinks. Either you don't go hungry or you go ready to spend a lot of money to fill satisfied."

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/30/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Literally every little detail. Wonderful atmosphere. Excellent food, beautiful presentation. From the simple elegance of table decor; an air plant in a clear glass vase, to the water jug with big cork plug, the simple elegance is palpable. I had the sweet potato dumpling, Asian Bowl and the sous vide lady apple desert. I wanted to take the desert for carry out but they wouldn't serve it carry out; as not to compromise the dish or presentation. I appreciated that! I decided to order it any way.  I left stuffed. I don't normally eat that much out, but I didn't want to leave and NOT experience something from every course. My americano coffee was served with hot cashew milk; a really nice touch- and coconut sugar. I don't normally take sugar in my coffee, but I wanted to experience the  combo of cashew milk and coconut sugar. Excellent coffee. The outdoor dining beside a Grove of trees was really lovely- one tree, beautifully lit, looked like a goddess! When you eat there, look for it!  The interior seating and bar area was contemporary and hip. Can't wait to come back and enjoy another fabulous experience- this time with others who love Raw, and fresh and vegan. I was there on my own, but really wished others could experience it with me too! Next time! Thank you!"

I am so impressed with this place, that I am writing the review from the table... ,Honestly, the menu did not sound appealing to me, but still decided to give it a shot, and I am very glad I did. While the food was not ""out of this world"", it was VERY VERY good... and the ambiance and the service made it an overall experience of 10/10... ,Definitely recommend it... at first I though I shouldn't believe the 17 - 5 star reviews... but again... here I am... gladly leaving the #18..."

The passion fruit flan is REMARKABLE and we didn't recognize it was plant based until half way through and were truly mind blown because flan is literally made from milk!!!! The cauliflower is delicious, the mushroom ""ropa vieja"" WOW. My least favorite part, if I'm honest, is the watermelon drink. It tastes really fresh and refreshing, but WAY too sweet! So if you're not into sweet sweet drinks, try their mojito..... it's the bomb lol they offered us a tour after dining and it was incredible!!!!!! Check out the photos of this kitchenless eatery:"

An international crowd.  Wine list very good, considering all are organic.  Highly recommend.  Hear that chef owner is in litigation with landlord, so not sure if will be here longer.   But while it is, you should go."

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/20/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"If you have not been to Plant Miami, you need to go now!!! OK so why go to a Vegan restaurant if your not Vegan? Ha! This place will convince you, you just might tolerate being Vegan. The food is delicious and the ambiance is spectacular. We visited on a Tuesday night and the stars where out and the view of the lit up buildings through the trees, sitting next  to the fountain  was magical. We had the castelvetrano olives to start which were delicious and the Beet Tostadas. For dinner we had the celery root lazagna. I don't like celery and I left nothing on my plate! We topped it off with the sweet potatoes pie and we were fighting for the spoon. All in all it was a great experience."

Please open a location in Boston!!"

"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/25/2018,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"The bf loves to take me here on date night.  He is an omnivore, but still very much enjoys eating here.  It is very romantic and the food is delicious.  I love that they keep things raw, as I have not seen any other raw vegan fine dining establishments in Miami.  The aged nut cheeses are heavenly, as I have not tasted bleu cheese in years and this is as close as it gets.  I love a vegan restaurant that will create their own cheese, rather than throwing some Daiya on everything.  The attention to detail in each dish is awesome.,That all being said, their are a few negatives..  The parking situation is tricky if you do not want to pay for valet.  I wish the parking lot next door was just open for free parking.  The service is average.  The servers are certainly knowledgeable, but not especially attentive.  I have sat with an empty wine glass or water glass and not been asked to refill, when I would gladly order another (missed opportunity).  I also, like many other reviewers, wish the prices were slightly lower.  I understand that every dish is of great quality (not quantity), but I would like to dine here more often (certainly would if I had a higher ""dining-out budget"").,Tip:  Dining here during Miami Spice gives you a nice prix fixe option at a good price."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"I'm not saying I'm going vegan, but if you are this is your place. ,First of all the setting is just amazing. Outdoor indoor seating with amazing palm trees. Very ""miamish"" you just have to visit to understand  what I mean. ,My friend is vegan and I gave him the liberty to order for me. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I know it contained ,Portobello mushrooms. Every thing was perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing. ,Weather you are visiting or live in Miami PLANT is a must,There is valet parking and also self park. ,Be advised that sometimes the have events and might be closed to the public make sure you call ahead and find out."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/29/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This place is a real gem. Located in the sacred garden venue, plant offers gourmet raw vegan cuisine.,Started off with the beets dish, very good but wouldn't recommend it to people who never had raw or vegan food. ,For my main dish I had the pasta and it was amazing. This dish could easily be served at a gourmet non vegan restaurant. ,Dessert was a sweet potatoe pie. Had better. ,Overall great food and real refreshing to see a vegan place with this quality of food. Will definitely be back!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",10/25/2017,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"Fabulous atmosphere hidden behind a gold wall. Not so easy to find. Great vegan dishes. We had a Ceasar salad, that our carnivore friend said was better than a a non vegan. It was large and cheesy with very interesting seasoning.  The avocado smash was also great with chunky chips.  My husband had a fantastic banana tamale which was warm and delicious. Our friend had a cold veggie lasagne which he devoured. ,I had the coconut ceviche tacos which I honestly was too full to eat. The were served in collard greens, which is my favorite. They were actually a little too lemony for my taste but that's kind of the ceviche flavor. ,The service was excellent as was the outdoor seats no area.  Vegans must give this place a try. Street parking by app or valet."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/12/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Wow, fantastic plant-based dishes! The taste of these dishes far exceed the vegan restaurant by my place in Maryland and I'm jealous.,Do expect to spend some money. This is an upscale place and portions are a bit small too. I had the Moroccan Bowl and while it seemed larger than some of the other dishes, it was so delicious that I really could have used another few bites! ,The other refreshing thing about this place is many of their dishes are whole/raw foods rather than full of dishes that really stretch to copy their animal-based originals. Many times, those types of recipes--in my opinion--are a flop because they try to be something they're not and they end up tasting funny.,To move on to the drinks, while you're here, order one or two! Even the nonalcoholic ones are amazing. You're already splurging by eating here, so why not have the full experience? The next time I'm in Miami, I will make a point to visit this calming, beautiful, and delicious establishment again."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",4/21/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This was an experience....an amazing one! The food was to die for and so elegantly displayed, a true form of art! from beginning to end the service was impeccable. I loved the Harvest Dumplings and the Cacio Di Funghi. Can't wait to return to try some of the other items they have. The seasonal and local fresh ingredients are so delicious and in most cases you can't even tell that it is a vegan restaurant. I reeeally do recommend the dishes I mentioned above, a must try for sure! Just an FYI, I am not a Vegan, and I loved this place!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",12/16/2017,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Stunning restaurant! Amazing experience for brunch - we sat outside in a beautifully designed courtyard, listening to mellow Thievery Corporation, and ordered a couple of dishes and cocktails. The service was impeccable, very knowledgeable, insightful, and helpful without being pushy. The food was sooooo beautifully plated, it tasted divine, and even though it was vegan/raw, my husband (who loves meat and tends to shun anything vegetarian) and I felt very satisfied after eating.,The only negative were the shaved truffles - they were rather bland and tasteless. I'm a huge truffle fan, and these were kind of stale. ,Still I highly recommend eating here! It's pricey, yes, but it will be a very memorable experience. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",11/4/2017,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"This place was a really great find. Tucked away in a little hideaway in the middle of wynwood.  We had the beet toast, avocado toast, and tomale. All fantastic! Thr food is so good you dont even know its vegan.

I stumbled upon this place during a recent visit to Miami and it's making me want to extend my visit so I can come back again and again!! The food was delicious, light, filling and GORGEOUSLY presented! I didn't even want to eat some of it since it literally looked like art! The wait staff beautifully explains each dish to you as it's brought out and is incredibly attentive the whole time. ,I started with the harvest dumplings to share (sweet potato and kimchi), then got the cacio di fungi and ended with the delicious dessert special: a coconut flan! My mother got the celery root lasagna and ended with their chocolate forest special. We picked at each other's meals and it was all phenomenal. It's all RAW, healthy, tasty. ,Most vegan restaurants make up for flavor by frying, over-salting, over-oiling, etc. Not this place!! We got a tour through the kitchen after (an awesome service they provide) and there was no smell or anything bad. They have nothing to hide! Most food is dehydrated or cooked sous vide, or simply raw!,Everyone working is SO sweet and you get the chance to meet the chefs! They showed us some more dishes they were preparing which all looked phenomenal (attached photos of those too!). They also have an extensive drink list from their eco bar. ,Hoping to make it back again before leaving. It's a MUST"
"601 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33131",8/6/2018,$$,5,La Centrale,"One of my overall favorite dining experiences ever occurred at Stagionale, the vegetarian/vegan restaurant in La Centrale. The entire experience was premium and holistic. The staff was friendly and we were checked up upon the perfect amount of time- not too much nor too little. The manager and owner thanked us for the patronage and made sure we enjoyed our experience and the server was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. ,The food was amazing starting with a kimchi shot for digestion. We decided to do 1 miami spice menu but chose both the jackfruit tacos and a side of edamame sliders. The entree for the miami spice was the gnocchi which was also good. The waiter suggested the carbonara with bacon tempeh (not on the menu) and it was one of the best vegan dishes I've had in my life. The dessert was also good as well. It ended with pills of turmeric and wheat grass and the experience has me craving more... we'll be back! ,P.S. 18% gratuity was added at the end but the service was definitely worth it,P.P.S. The menu was recently changed a few days before our visit and it is great!"

I had done a little research and decided we had to make a visit to Plant. We have been moving towards more of a Vegan lifestyle for a while and I thought this would be great.,It wasn't great, it was a stellar experience. From the decor of minimalism to the zen music and of course the food. It was like a symphony. Everything just flowed and we felt as if had been transported to a different place. ,We started with the smashed avocado appetizer with quinoa and chia chips. Simply splendid.,As our main meal (lunch), I had the zucchini lasagna and my husband had the cauliflower steak. Heavenly and light and filled with flavor. ,Why isn't this place in Atlanta in walking distance from our home in Brookhaven. Sweet dreams I will always have of this place. Bravo to the entire staff."

The drinks, starters, main entres, dessert and even the latte with cashew milk was just to die for! ,Sebastian took us on a tour of the kitchen and it was incredible to see how the ingredients are meticulously prepared. The dishes were not just food, it was art.,Can't wait for my next trip to Miami!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",8/5/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Exceptional evening in a peaceful oasis tucked away from the typical grunge of the area. Every dish was its own adventure, a sparkling example a raw, vegan, organic and sustainable art form. I was initially concerned about the portions, because I'm just a glutton that way, but friends and I left very satisfied. I'd even say we were all glowing on that special kind of high you can only get from a perfectly balanced, unexpectedly flavorful, and wildly interesting vegan meal."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",1/9/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"This is probably most exquisite, artistic, creative and authentic vegan restaurant on the East Coast that I know of. And I get out and about.,Before under the chef Michael Keeney now under Sacred Space umbrella, I  found the whole experience is warmer, food servings are more robust, cocktails sexier and all around more colorful. Plus Chef Vero is my hero for gorgeous delist desserts.,I've always enjoyed this space and Plant Miami is the cherry on the top: elegant, beautiful, laid back exquisite, it manages to be a sanctuary in the middle of Miami bustle."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",8/2/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Phenomenal !!! My new favorite restaurant!  It's so beautiful with a soothing environment. I decided to order  the Dumplings, Kale + Avocado salad, Rainbow Bowl, Summer squash Lasagna and for dessert the Havalah squares. I can't say I liked anyone more than the other. Because all the dishes were perfection from the presentation down to the taste. And the best part is that you feel amazing after eating real raw vegan food. The customer service was also on point. They even gave us a tour and recommended their Hollistic events and culinary classes. Which I'm definitely going to check out! Highly recommend this restaurant!"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/14/2018,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"I was initially hesitant to eat here because I wasn't sure how I would like vegan food but it was great!! The kofta curry was so delicious with the right amount of spices and consistency. Even the koftas were delicious! Made out of sunflower seeds and mushroom! I got the sweet potato pie for dessert! That was delicious as well!!,Only complaint was I wish there was more kofta curry to eat, I felt that it was a small portion"
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",5/20/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Wow what an experience. Everything about this place is amazing. Came here for a date night and was honestly a little worried since we are not vegan but dairy and gluten free. ,This place did not disappoint. Everything we ordered tasted great and was very filling. Since it was our first time, we decided to order a couple of different plates to share. We decided on the cheese plate, kimchi dumplings, kale salad and the cacio di funghi. ,We were so satisfied with our meal that we didn't order dessert but we will definitely be back just for drinks and that flan. ,The ambiance here is great. We sat at an outside table and it was very pleasant. It doesn't even feel like you're in Miami. ,All of the waitstaff is very knowledgeable as well and explained every detail of our orders before we dug in. John and Alex helped us out. ,I will say it is pretty pricey here so we will be saving plant for special occasions."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/19/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Absolutely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life. The food was exquisite (fancy word). My girl is vegan and she confessed to me that this was the best restaurant she's ever been to. ,The Harvest dumplings , beet tostada, banana  tamale, Casio Di Funghi were so bomb! Also got the Key Lime Brûlée, which was just simply amazing.,Some people may not like the prices, but it's worth it. ,I'm not even Vegan, but I have to go back. ,A must try for anybody who likes fresh, organic, delicious upscale food."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",2/6/2018,$$$,5,Plant Miami,"Wait, this is vegan?!?,Having had Plant Miami in my bookmarks for a while, I finally had the opportunity to give it a try.  The location of the restaurant is not the most amazing, as it is not really close to anything, deep down on and dead end street.  But once you turn into the parking lot you start understanding why.  The place feels out of a movie, a beautiful patio / outdoor scenery where you can spend countless hours sipping down on drinks, chatting and enjoying delicious food.  The ambiance inside is also quite modern and enjoyable, but if you get a choice outdoors is definitely nicer. ,Since the moment You walk into the restaurant, service is spot on; they ensure that every single detail of the experience is great, starting with recommendations and ending with a description of the food. ,The most amazing part of the experience, is the food, especially from a non vegan perspective.  We tried 4 different dishes, each of them was perfectly crafted, with all the ingredients well thought out, good/sizable portions, and delicious. The only issue is that for a 3 course meal you will spend around $50 per person. ,Overall,  if you want a nice, classy place to try delicious food (it is vegan, but it is delicious from any perspective) Plant Miami is a great alternative."
"105 NE 24th St, Miami, FL 33137",6/16/2018,$$$,4,Plant Miami,"Plant Miami is a higher end vegan spot that tries to bridge vegan and tasty.  It's an inside/outside open kitchen feel, very progressive.  I can see why people enjoy this place, the ambiance is amazing outside with a small pool in the courtyard.  Service is great as well.  Would definitely return and recommend."
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/31/2017,$$,5,Pincho Factory,"I would never fathom that a place called Pincho Factory offered a vegan burger, but lucky for me and other health nuts, it does!  Their bean burger is blended with sweet potato and flour-no eggs here!  It's delicious.  Pair that with their Cajun fries and you got yourself a meal exploding with flavor.,I love their sincere desire to serve customers.  I called to place an order, hesitant as I was certain I wouldn't find anything vegan.  The guy who took my call, Eric, was SUPER affable and courteous.  He described all the ingredients in the burger and even told me to drive safely on my way to pick up my order.  No one has ever wished me a safe drive to pick an order before.  ,My meat-eating colleagues also love this place, so when lunch time comes around, we group up and head over.  I am obsessed with their Cajun fries!  I'll even eat them cold and soggy.  They put caramelized onions on top--yum!,Pincho Factory is quick, affordable, and absolutely delectable!"
"30 Giralda Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/20/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"Good. Fast food type atmosphere. I'm vegan and I wanted to try the veggie burger but I ended up only trying the Cajun tostones.. the menu didn't have enough description on the menu and I didn't know it would have a non-vegan mayo based sauce on it.,Still tasty though! ,Seems great for meat lovers."
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",12/21/2017,$$,4,MIAM,"Best breakfast/brunch of my recent trip to Miami. Very cute cafe in the super trendy/hipster Wynwood area. You order at the counter but there is table service. The menu featured several gluten free, dairy free and vegan options. The coconut chia pudding topped with nuts and fruit was even tastier than it was beautiful (and you'll probably agree that it is quite Instagram worthy). My only small complaint was the cold brew was terrible. I'm hard pressed to call a coffee terrible as someone who loves coffee so maybe it was an off day? Regardless next Miami vacation will no doubt include a visit to Miam."
"709 NE 79th St, Miami, FL 33138",6/4/2017,$$,5,The Anderson,"Totally recommend this bar! Awesome vibe with music at perfect volume so great for a first date or group gatherings. I can tell it's a popular place judging by how crowded it was by 11 on the Saturday that I went. Delicious cocktails that change every three months. Food was also a hit. I'm vegan so they made an awesome vegan wrap for me that I can't wait to order again. There's street parking but also for convenience, valet for only $5."
"2750 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33127",7/15/2018,$$,4,MIAM,"Wynwood overall is pretty trendy so Miam does not fail to give that cool wynwood vibe. It was easy to find parking, there wasn't a long line. My partner tried their breakfast burrito and I tried the vegan version which was the exact same thing only that his had bacon. Breakfast burrito was good but not filling. Vegan donut was good but you need to pair it with a cup a coffee, it makes it taste better. ,Try their chai tea latte iced, loved it because it's not as sweet as others I've tried. Service very friendly!"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",8/2/2015,$$,3,Yard House,"Came to Yard House for lunch on Thursday. Yard House is a favorite of my office because of the large assortment of food, as well as a very vegetarian and vegan friendly menu. I meanwhile ordered the steak sandwich medium rare and it was absolutely delicious. I enjoy Yard House because of the ambience and the food, but my issue is always the prices. As much as I would like to give it a better review, everything on the menu is just too over priced. That goes double for drinks. Perhaps it is an inflated ego, but I truly believe that Yard House is not a nice enough restaurant to charge the prices they do."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",5/27/2014,$$,5,Yard House,"love the vegan ""wings"" and veggie angel hair.,I really love that they have a Gardein menu for vegetarians and vegans.,(plus so many beers)"

And of course a large variety of beer on tap. But the service is a bit slow, even on days when it's not busy in there."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/30/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"Today I had lunch at yard house Miami beach. Recently, (few months ago) I went vegan and stopped eating all meats and dairy products. I was very disciplined with this until a few weeks ago I started missing being able to dine out without having to ask for an alternative menu. Because I know the dangers of a lot of red meat and hormone in chicken and turkey, I've incorporated only sea food to my diet. ,Yard house offers a rice bowl with chicken and assorted vegetable. I was totally craving this today minus the chicken. I spoke with my waitress who spoke to the manager and switched the protein in my dish for shrimp. I was able to eat what I wanted without the guilt of eating something I knew my body would not be able to handle. It was delicious! Their drinks are also very tasteful. I'm into all sweet and fruity drinks so if I could recommend any I would say have the ""bikini Tini""!  This is a combination of Malibu, banana liquor, pineapple juice and pomegranate. Simply delicious ! ,Oh and needless to say this place is super affordable !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",11/26/2016,$$,5,Yard House,"I've never had a vegan dish like the Gardein Orange Peel ""chicken"" at Yard House. I've been there a total of three times now, I always get the same thing and every time it gets better. I wish it was closer to me but that also saves me money. The waiters do their best and always keep an eye out for you too. I can't wait to try their new vegan burger next time! Yard House has something for everyone!"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/29/2017,$$,5,Yard House,One of the best restaurants in Coral Gables. Many vegetarian and Vegan options. The restaurant gets super packed so make sure you make a reservation. Food is very nice quality.
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",6/9/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Our server Jade enhanced our experience with great knowledge on the menu and a pleasant attitude. She checked on us just the right amount of times, she knew plenty of information on our vegan and vegetarian options, and she was check ready and did not have to go print the check because she already had it with her. I used to work at Bahama Breeze which is a disaster compared to this Yard house! My favorite part is how much variety they have in their Gardein vegetarian menu and how easy it was to make those plates vegan. Being a vegan is difficult sometimes because most restaurants usually cater to vegetarians. I will definitely be coming back here again for any special occasions so that I can enjoy a good vegan plate."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",7/15/2017,$$,5,Yard House,"Let me start off by saying, WHY have I not been here before! Food, service, atmosphere, everything was amazing! So I came here because as a new vegan I've been wanting to check out places that offer vegan dishes but also offer meat for my boyfriend. I am so glad, I decided to come here. VEGAN burger was absolutely amazing with a kale Caesar salad to die for. Kat, our server was so great and was able to recommend things for me and help me out with the menu. My boyfriend has the Lamb burger, and he loved it (beware of the spicy jalapeño sauce). I loved it and we will definitely be back! ,Thanks KAT !"
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",5/28/2017,$$,4,Yard House,"Excellent lunch choice as a destination or as a break while shopping at the mall or post workout from the local gym. Loved that there's a gardein section for vegetarian and vegan friendly palettes. Got the guacamole, the poke nachos, the gardein vegan burger, and the gardein bbq chicken pizza. Luckily the place was quiet (just opened for lunch) when we arrived. The staff was attentive and prompt. All the dishes were amazing. Sat indoors which was dark but  comfortable. Outdoor seating is also available. Kitchen and staff are doing a very good job with creating flavorful dishes and an overall nice experience."

As long time vegans, this is our go to restaurant, and we've never been disappointed."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",3/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"We love this place.  They have Vegan options that are Yummy, a wide range of Beer and a full bar.  The service is always excellent and the price is very reasonable for the location and ambiance."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/9/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I like yard house because they have a vegetarian section of the menu that uses gardein products. Most of these options can be made vegan really easily- I've never had a server who couldn't help me make a nice meal. I usually get fried ""chicken"" wings with fries. Not healthy at all but the place also has over 100 beers on tap, and it's a sports bar, so I'm going all out anyways. The chips and guac come with cheese sprinkled on top- so make sure to ask for no cheese if you're vegan. They also have the option of fries, truffle fries (has cheese), or sweet potato fries with most meals."
"320 San Lorenzo Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146",2/20/2018,$$,5,Yard House,"I'm vegan //// got an awesome vegan blackened Gardein chicken avocado sandwich. You have to ask for it without mayo and cheese but it's pretty yummy. ,The Gardein chicken is really convincing! Even my non-vegan friends liked it."
"7535 N Kendall Dr, Miami, FL 33156",8/9/2015,$$$,4,Texas de Brazil,"For all the meat-lovers out there, Texas de Brazil is everything you could want. I went to the Dadeland Mall location this past Friday for lunch and everyone in my party loved it, except my one vegan co-worker. The meal starts with a trip to the buffet which in addition to the usual salad bar items has a delicious lobster bisque, cheesy gratin potatoes, and a wide selection of cured meats. But the real fun starts when you sit back down at your table and flip your card to green. The staff comes around with a large variety of different meats for you to choose from. I cannot remember everything I had but I was a big fan of the flank steak, chicken breast in bacon, and the pork loin. Waiters continue to circle your table with different meats until every card is turned back to red and no one can eat another bite, if you can even move. For lunch it is only $27, which is honestly a great value. The only real issue is that you will find that your productivity will come to an end as you can hardly move let alone think when you return to work. I know I will be back."
"2721 NW 79th Ave, Doral, FL 33122",4/22/2017,$,5,Central Park Food Station,This small and cozy place is amazing. You have variety from vegan dishes to traditional Venezuelan ones. I came here for lunch while working in Doral & always brought my co workers along. I will always return.
"3620 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",4/22/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,Very flavorful.  Excellent service.  I especially loved the ghost pepper cheddar naan and morels in yogurt sauce. The tandoori short ribs were lean savory with a nice spiciness. Lots of vegan options and enough meat poultry and fish to have something for everyone.
"3620 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137",3/9/2018,$$,5,Ghee Indian Kitchen,Love the original and this new location. Fantastic places both. Just go eat there and you'll be happy. Ghee thanks so much for offering vegan options!!!! Would be fantastic if you could note which of your vegetarian options could be prepared vegan with a little modification. Or just offer more vegan options!!! Thank you!
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/24/2012,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Not only was the food excellent, their service was good too, which is hard to find in Miami.  We had the spring rolls, pad thai, and red curry.  We ordered everything vegetarian and our server asked if we were vegan.  While we are not vegan, it shows that the restaurant is willing to make adjustments and be vegan friendly.  Also, the entrees are big enough to share, so the food can be economical if you are willing to share food."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",9/12/2012,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Vegan friendly, the Volcano Tofu was delish."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",11/19/2011,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Happily another surprise gem in the Gables. I used to eat here when I was an omnivore who lived down the street. Now I'm a vegan who lives in South Beach, and without a car, it's rare that I get to the Gables. But when I'm there, I still want to eat (c'mon, I ALWAYS want to eat!).,I was asking questions about the menu (as we vegans are known to do) and the server actually said to me, ""You tell me you're vegan, I'll make your meal vegan."" That simple. He was knowledgeable and friendly and I had some delicious vegan spring rolls and a phenomenal veggie curry.,I'm always on the lookout for places I can eat with my non-vegan friends where we can ALL be happy. Lotus Garden is definitely a winner on that list."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/10/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Really fresh and tasty Thai food, the servers were so helpful and very polite and had a great knowledge of vegan food (suggested a substitute for the sauce with the spring rolls which was delicious) would definately visit or order out from here again if I'm in the area :)"
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",2/23/2018,$$,5,Lotus Garden,"Love this place! The food is delicious, the portion just right and it's great value. There are vegan options. They offer take out. It's a winner! ,It's nice it's not a chain. The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is always relaxed and welcoming."
"318 Miracle Mile, Miami, FL 33134",10/12/2017,$$,5,Lotus Garden,Absolutely loved the food and service! We had green curry and the penang curry which were both phenomenal. They were also awesome in accommodating for a vegan diet.
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",6/6/2012,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I went to The Last Carrot for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious! I had the felafel pita sandwhich. The pita bread was very thin, so it's kind of a messy sandwhich and I would recommend that you either ask for a fork or keep it wrapped up as you eat it. The sandwhich comes with a green sauce, I have no idea what's in this sauce but it is so good. The place is your typical hipster kind of vegan hole-in-the-wall place in coconut grove so you cannot expect it to be so pristine. Everything is natural and made right in front of you so if you don't like what you see you can walk right out. I only gave it 4 stars because of the cleanliness, but the fact that they were preparing my lunch right in front of me was a huge plus! Everyone was very nice it took a few minutes for the girl to acknowledge us, but nothing I would complain about, the bar was almost completely full and she was only one of 2 servers/cooks so it's understandable. I would recommend this place if you want to have a quick, healthy lunch with a home-made feel. I didn't try the juices but they looked amazing and I will be going back to try one."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/4/2009,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot isn't much to look at, but from the second I walked in the door I knew that I had made it to a little slice of vegan heaven. Instead of trying to decide between Chinese take out classics like Buddha's Delight and Bean Curd & Eggplant or pizza (no cheese) plus a meager list of toppings from the local pizzeria, I had a full menu to choose from including vegan desserts! It had only been a week since I dined at an ultra vegan-friendly restaurant but it seemed like an eternity and I took my time looking over the menu. Would I try the Spicy Tofu Pita Sandwich? Maybe the Hummus Pita? Homemade Veggieburgers are always a safe choice. Or did I want to go for one of their ginormous (yes that's a word, because I say so!) salads. Maybe some hearty soup and a salad. Then there was the prospect of having a smoothie made from real fruit, not concentrated fruit juice or syrups. As I tried to make my decision I looked down to see a huge vegan cake beckoning me to come closer and a full case of vegan cookies and brownies.

"8347 NW 36th St, Doral, FL 33166",9/10/2017,$$,5,Marfil Bistro,"We came here for the first time, our waiter was very polite and accommodating. We are vegan, so I asked the waiter if I could order a vegetable pasta, he said he would check with the chef. When he returned he said the chef will make anything you want! He told me to choose whatever pasta, vegetables, and sauce I wanted. I was just very basic because I didn't want to be demanding, so I asked for linguine with mushrooms, tomatoes, and red tomato sauce. When I got my food the chef added zucchini, asparagus and other vegetables! Best vegetable pasta I have had, very flavorful! The chef was amazing, not only did he make something that was not on the menu, but during our meal, he came out to greet us and made sure everything was ok with what we ordered! Excellent customer service! I wasn't expecting them to do this for me, because I usually get turned down at restaurants and just end up ordering a salad. This is my first yelp review and I just want to say thank you very much! I live in Hawaii but come to Miami a few times a year, when I'm here this will be my go to place!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/26/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I like this place, the food is good, they've got a range of vegan and gluten-free options, and the atmosphere is casual, quiet and great for a mellow leisurely lunch. The food is prepared before your eyes in a relatively clean kitchen, free (but limited) parking and cash only (as far as I know). The staff is cordial but the service is glacial whether he place is empty or at peak hours. Don't go for lunch on a week day, you won't get back to work in time even if you ask for takeout. I would recommend ordering by phone and picking up."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/25/2010,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Fresh papaya juice and wheat veggie pita with hummus. Health Nut list to the max. The great Vegetarian and Healthfood Counter in the grove.  The spinach pies are also pretty yummy.  This is not a strictly vegetarian place, they do serve chicken and tuna, but its all fresh (at least that's what the food tastes like).  They make great juices and smoothies with all natural ingredients.  It is expensive for a hole in the wall hippie place - a pita sandwich made of hummus and freshly squeezed juice with a vegan brownie for desert cost about $10.  I wouldn't label this posh though because I'm sure the rent is more expensive than the locally grown and raised ingredients."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",9/10/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,This hidden gem has the best fresh vegan/organic food a girl could ask for. It's so good that the line is to the door during lunch hour so make sure you order ahead of time. The girls that work the counter are always so nice & hospitable - they never fail to call me by name. I highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it! :)
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/1/2013,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I wish there were more places like this in Miami. The menu is simple but always good. Fresh squeezed juices, home made dressings, plentiful veggies, tasty toppings, and homemade vegan dessert. All you have to do is sit at the bar, and order your food, the staff are very nice btw. But you will wait a little if it's lunch time I suggest coming a little before or after the rush, or ordering beforehand if time is crucial for you. Best fresh food around and at a reasonable price. Really, they can't make it easier."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/9/2012,$,3,The Last Carrot,"Small place, bar counter service and free parking. No matter what ""sandwich"" you get the sauce will make it great. I had the veggie burger and she had a hummus. Everything is served on a very thin pita. So, if you don't like it messy you may wish to order a pie (think empenada here). We showed up 15 minutes before they closed on Sunday evening so they were out of a few fruits for smoothies and the place could use some attention to being clean (bathroom especially). The motto that rang out was ""at least it is vegan"". I just hope all behind the scenes was cleaner than what met the eye but that is rarely the case. ,Vegan cookie was a treat and great. How often do you get a vegan white chocolate macadamia cookie (or was it vegan). Also, it was nice to have a fresh juice though this close to the mall scene.,In short - It was tasty. I just can't truly trust it."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/30/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"A local health/vegan favorite.  VERY ""divey"" and ""hole in the wall"" but that's part of the charm.  Limited menu but what they ave is delicious AND GET PLENTY OF SAUCES (you'll know what I mean after you try them both)."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/11/2015,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Me and my wife love this place! It's a little hole in the wall in the grove, with very friendly service and great food. We usually always get the chicken pita with all the veggies plus avocado & either a smoothie or fresh juice. The best part is getting dessert, they usually have some kind of vegan, organic, gluten-free delicious cake!!!!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/24/2014,$,5,The Last Carrot,"The Last Carrot is a Coconut Grove staple, cherished by Groveites and non-Groveites alike.  I've been coming here for over 25 years, and, though I moved away, I always make it a point to come here to get lunch at least once during my visits back home.  Everything is fresh and tasty. My favorites are the cream cheese and cucumber pita and the chicken or tuna salad melt served in the spinach pie (not the Greek style ones, more like a triangular shaped pita filled with spinach).  They use the spinach pies that are baked fresh at The Daily Bread (soooo good). I always get the green sauce to have with my sandwiches.  I don't know how they make that stuff, but I could put that on anything and everything I eat!  Additionally, they were making fresh, healthy juices way before juicing was cool, and their grasshopper (pineapple with wheatgrass) is delicious. Their vegan desserts are also very good; I, personally, am a big fan of their brownies. The place is family owned and service is always quick and good."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",10/7/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,Awesome vegan place!! If you want a quick juice or healthy snack this is the place to go. I got the special of the day the falafel pita which was amazing and the orange and carrot juice. It was quick easy and decliious. The only thing I didnt like is that they only take credit cards!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/20/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"One of the best vegan spots in Miami with a nice range of Juices, Smoothies, Spinach Pies, Salads, and Sandwiches... All the juices are refreshing - my personal favorite is the Orange-Papaya... Though the smoothie selection isn't as big, they incorporate their seasonal fruits... They have tasty sandwiches, salads, and quiches that come with their original sauces which are a must on any dish. My favorite dish is the Tuna Melt, it's name is fitting since the sandwich literally melts in your mouth! The only critique is that they don't accept credit cards and they close pretty early- definitely a place for lunch rather than dinner."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/14/2015,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been going there for over 20 years and it is STILL one of my favorite places. LOVE the chicken salad in a pita with   green vinaigrette, cheese and tomato spinach pie, fresh apple juice and vegan carrot cake!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/27/2014,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I really like the Last Carrot's menu. They offer health food that is actually delicious and filling. Although a simple dish, the Baked Tofu Salad is very flavorful, vegan and pretty filling -- specifically, the baked tofu and the salad dressings are what make the salad so flavorful (ask for both dressings so you can decide which one you like better; I like them both). ,I make a meal out of a salad and a spinach pie. I love the spinach pies! The cheese is deliciously melty and I like how it's not a typical spinach pie because they use a healthy whole wheat pita instead of a fatty flaky crust. ,Aside from the food, the service is a little spotty. I've been here and have been completely ignored or unacknowledged for at least 5-10 minutes before someone said hello and took my order. Other times I've waited less than 5 minutes and the staff seemed pretty pleasant. I guess you'll never know what the service will be like here but at least they make up for it with delicious food!,I'll definitely keep coming back here for the reason that the way I feel after a meal is energized, healthy and satisfied. I'd rather go here for lunch than Chipotle and feel completely stuffed and gross after."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/15/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"This spot has been my favorite for years! Good ol' clean and delicious food. It's always satisfying and friendly on your pocket. It's good for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. I'll forever be faithful to this place."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",8/4/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"I've been going to this place for years and the food will always be deeelicious.  My favorite is the spinach pie with tomato and avocado.  And don't forget the vinaigrette!  I'm not sure what's in this green sauce but man it's so flavorful and bright.  I could eat the stuff with a spoon it's so good.  Juices and smoothies are also very yummy, and they make an INCREDIBLE vegan chocolate cake. Definitely recommend!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/10/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,"They were super friendly and more than willing to customize my order. Most of the eating area is counter top and definitely was the place to be during lunch hour. Anyone looking for a vegan or vegetarian eatery, this place is absolutely great!! Can't wait to come back again when I'm in Coconut Grove"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/27/2016,$,5,The Last Carrot,Natural at its finest!  This place isbrefeeshing whether youre a vegan or just want to keep it light.  Had the grosshopper juice which had fresh pineapple and wheat grass shot.  So good. Iwas in the mood for something sweet so I ordered the peanut butter apple and banana PITA.  My daughter had the chicken salad pita that was stuffed with brussel sprouts and veggies delicious.  Everything was refreshing you feel good after you eat here I will definitely be back also prices are low under $10 per person.
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/5/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,I am a Coconut Grove Native and this is my favorite place to go eat on a regular. The chicken salad pita or the spinach pie with cheese extra crunchy with the tofu they marinate and bake so good. Yum. Then the dressings and the smoothies and the vegan cake..AND the brownies!!
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/19/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Just walking into this place makes you feel like you can live to be 100.  The food and juices are so healthy and fresh.  I had the chicken salad with greens and the beet juice with ginger was extremely delicious and satisfying.  There is a little bit of a wait as the place is small and there are about three staff helping people.  The staff takes your order, prepares your meal and then helps the next group waiting.  It's great because you go get your food promptly after you order, but I think that for general customer satisfaction, if you had some interaction and then waited 10 minutes for your order as a customer you wouldn't feel as anxious.  The food is very good and as I said FRESH.  It's a great healthy alternative and has a lot of vegan options."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",1/15/2018,$,4,The Last Carrot,"I've been to The Last Carrot a few times and have always really enjoyed the food.  This is a juice and pita/salad place that serves up really good, really healthy stuff.  There is no table service, you have to order at the counter and bring it back to your seat.  I love the baked tofu.  The green sauce here should be bottled and marketed immediately.  Drink selection is somewhat limited and they do offer lots of natural juices and smoothie type drinks.  Great little vegetarian/vegan/healthy spot in the Grove.  It's homey and friendly but a touch on the loud side when the juicer starts up.  What a great spot for a quick bite that your body will thank you for."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/25/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Well definitely a place with healthy food healthy options. Don't look anywhere else if you are vegan , organic , or looking for healthy food , this is the place . I like everything they have . Excellent juices and pita ! The chicken one and avocado are my favorite! But I'm sure they are all good , I tried their dressings really nice stuff , in general this is a little down to earth store serving excellent healthy food options. The ambience it's totally local and family oriented, I saw young students and kids all around of course the prices are also very reasonable . And good service even though they are always busy."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",12/29/2017,$,4,The Last Carrot,"Walking through Coconut Grove and stumbled across this little hidden gem of a restaurant. I assumed by the name of this joint that it was vegan/vegetarian-friendly or a store for bunnies. To my luck they serve a pretty decent selection of smoothies, fresh drinks, salads, veggie sandwiches and more. ,Cool thing that stood out to me was that all their food was prepared fresh in front of you and you can pretty much smell the vegetables, fruits and breads they make on the spot. ,I wasn't too sure what to pick; fortunately there was this young lady that seemed to be a frequent guest of this restaurant and said it was her favorite in town. She was able to help me decide on what to order. Ended up getting the Baked Tofu Whole Wheat Pita Sandwich with Hummus Spread and a Grasshopper Juice. They brought with it some herbal paste and vinaigrette sauce that added a nice pop to the flavor of the sandwich. I've never been much of a tofu eater but this visit here may have changed that. The food is great, service was nice, convenient location, and my server hooked me up with a nice lil taster of the Açaí Smoothie since it was my first time trying out everything.,I was told you can't go wrong with whatever you select.!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",11/10/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"What mainly needs to be spoken about in this review is the extraordinary customer service given by each and every employee! So happy to have found a place who not only serves delicious, healthy, vegan food, but also values their customers!,I've driven passed this hidden gem a million times and have always wondered how their food must be. One day, strolling through Yelp I came across this spot and had to try.. best decision.,I ordered a grasshopper juice with added ginger. Deliciousness!!!! The ginger isn't normally added, but I requested it for those added health benefits.,I also enjoyed a vegan bean burger in a pita.. finger licking good! - I will definitely be returning very soon!"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$,3,The Last Carrot,"I ordered the solid white chicken sandwich with the whole wheat pita, and my sister ordered their regular garden salad. The food was nothing out of this world, it was okay. The service wasn't great either, the guy took forever to attend us even though he noticed we were standing there for about 15 minutes and aside from the fact that he didn't notice, when he came up to us he wasn't the friendliest. I can definitely say that if you're looking into any vegan/healthy places, this isn't the ideal place to go."
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",7/9/2017,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Fast, friendly, and delicious! Definitely a local hangout, this spot offers the BEST healthy and vegan friendly food options. As a huge meat lover myself I usually feel unsatisfied if my meal doesn't have at least some type of protein in it, but the last carrot does their wraps/pitas so well that it's just as filling and extremely satisfying. ,Don't forget to ask for the green vinaigrette sauce, it's absolutely delicious and will make even the biggest veggie hater eat all of their veggies! ,The juices and smoothies are all made fresh and taste great. My personal favorite is the grasshopper which is pineapple juice with a shot of wheatgrass. ,Prices are fair and staff is great. Would highly recommend if you're looking for something healthy but also satisfying"
"3133 Grand Ave, Miami, FL 33133",2/18/2018,$,5,The Last Carrot,"Cute little place we ran into. Healthy choices. Mostly salads and sandwiches, but hearty sandwiches. I was with a vegan and the server, young kid, took the time to explain the dressings, the veggies and even gave us a recommendation for something not on the menu. Well we went with that. Falafel with some secret green sauce - that if we could have just had a bucket this review would be longer. The young kid really made this place even nicer. Real down to earth and attentive. Highly recommend!"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/12/2010,$$,3,Green Gables Café,"i'll start by saying my mom works very close to Green Gables, so she'll often bring home their 'vegan meal of the day' for me to have for dinner or lunch the following day.  i've had lots of really nice stuff from here and considering that i was spoiled with how vegan/vegetarian friendly san francisco is, it's nice to have Green Gables around.  HOWEVER... the other day (tuesday, march 9th) my mom brought me home their eggplant/hummus wrap.  i was going out with some friends later on and decided to have half of the wrap.  it was very flavorful, which is sort of a departure from a lot of the stuff i've had here... in fact, i should have noticed it was TOO flavorful with an overbearing flavor that... wasn't too good.  but i was hungry and i scarfed it down.  later on that night i went to a place where 2-for-1 drinks are served by heavy-handed bartenders.  the following day, i could NOT get out of bed, save to throw up and let my dog out to pee.  i was in bed until 4pm and unable to eat until about 9pm.  let me just say here that i have an iron stomach.  i can eat three day old pizza that has been sitting out and not get sick (pretty gross, but i just want to stress what a fluke this is).  i think the last time i was sick to my stomach was as a kid.  anyhow, i blamed the gin and, as i told my friend, ""satan cleverly disguised as a bartender"".  the following day was OK.  i started out slow with a bowl of cereal and then did a bunch of errands and unpacking.  my dad took me out for lunch and we went to Norman Brother's for some sandwiches.  i had half of the Atomic Veggie (which was delicious).  all fine -- nothing to raise an eyebrow at.  later on this evening i'm getting ready to go to a friend's opening show at an art gallery and remember the other half of the wrap from Green Gables in my fridge.  i grab it, take at least 4 bites before realizing i really don't like the taste... so i threw it out.  forty minutes later i'm doubled over in pain, chugging down baking soda and water, and chasing it with cups of peppermint tea.  i went out that night completely gassy and bloated and this morning woke up early to run an errand which could not wait, clutching my stomach and chugging down more peppermint tea, but not before several trips to the toilet.  i'm only now starting to feel better.  i have no idea what it could have been, but i think if i'd have been a person with a weaker stomach, i might have landed in the hospital.  i'm pretty sketched out by this place now, so i'm going to hold off on eating anything from there for some time.  especially because it caters to vegans and everything is ""organic"", you'd think they would pride themselves on freshness.  i'm PRETTY SURE this was an isolated incident (although i wonder how many other people ordered the same wrap that day and had the same issue?) but i'm still a bit spooked and grossed out.  it's a shame, because i was totally stoked on this ""new"" place after moving back home to miami after my two years in SF.  :("
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/16/2009,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"love me some green gables for lunch! i go completely nuts for this place and got everyone in my office on the bandwagon. i really admire their attention to detail. every local or organically grown is creatively assembled into delicious meals. even the containers and utensils are made from recycled or completely bio-degradable materials. their vegan dishes are TO DIE FOR and really make you wonder how we have grown to depend so much on animal products when there are so many tantalizing vegan options out there. sign up for their mailing list and get a discount when you e-mail your order. they're always happy to accommodate special requests and answer any questions right away. there's no particular item i can recommend, every bite is exquisite, exciting and good for the earth."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/10/2010,$$,3,Green Gables Café,"ok, whenever im on a vegan detox kick im glad to have this place around. they have very interesting options for vegetarian food and yes its pricey but its organic and uses top notch expensive ingredients. i'd rather have my stomach happy then my wallet. 3 stars because i havent LOVED everything ive tried...."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/28/2012,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"Delicious vegan burger, perfect portion sizes."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",9/24/2009,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"This one of the best organic, healthy, and great tasting, original places to eat in the Gables and Miami.  Everything I've had has been very good, super fresh with really nice flavors and herbs.  I love the wraps, sandwiches, those carrot sticks and the vegan specials are awesome., The new location is larger and a fun and lively place for  lunch.  I also make of point of having all our office lunches catered by them, and it's always a welcome change."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",9/17/2012,$$,5,Green Gables Café,Delicious for a Flexitarian.  This is the real deal. Garden black bean burger is my favorite. The staff is friendly and service is great. They have vegan and vegetarian dishes but they also serve some tasty and healthy turkey dishes if someone in your group does not want vegetarian. This is my go to place for lunch when ever i am in the gables. I have not been to the breakfast yet but the menu looks good.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",12/17/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Amazing delicious food all vegan and ugh so good for the soul as well but I do wish they have a more array of desserts.their brownie that's in a bag was not tasty whatsoever but apart from that the place is very trendy and the food is tasty
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",12/16/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"This is a must go place for anyone who is vegan or that likes healthy food. We tried a few their bowls and the Mental Lentil was phenomenally good. They were flexible enough to accommodate a few in our party who had dietary restrictions as well. Hats off to you guys, this place is awesome!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",10/25/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I really like coming to this location. I ordered the pancakes with banana, and blueberries. They were the best vegan pancakes I have ever had. The pancakes are big so its a great deal for the price."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/20/2016,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I love the Choices concept and have frequented their other locations for years. This might be why I'm giving them three stars instead of two. I have eaten there a few times and the quality has been inconsistent. The service people, while very polite and reasonably attentive, have gotten orders wrong on most occasions and the items like the Mental Lentil wrap have had different ingredients and taste each time. I want to continue giving it a chance and I am ok paying more for vegan/organic, but i hope they work through growing pains and improve the service and food quality."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",2/20/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,I am so happy that Choices has come to the Grove! I love the new additions to the menu! We tried the taco sliders and Mexicana salad along with my daughter's favorite mac'n cheese and everything was great! I'm so happy to have a healthy vegan restaurant that I can walk/bike to with my family! Breakfast is also awesome there!
"2525 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/13/2018,$$$,5,Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar - Coral Gables,"If there was 10 stars this place would get it. This place is the absolute best for special occasions. It is not possible or this place to make ANY improvements. Our  waitress Lourdes was better than any classically trained wait staff. Lourdes was extremely attentive, fully aware requirements( vegan), she was little me part of your family in an authentic way. The food is well plated , well seasoned and very fresh. Do yourself a favor reserve now..."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/15/2016,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Overall , I think all the Choices are great around Miami. The food truly is delicious, but it's simple. It's plant based and can be easily duplicated at home or elsewhere. It is far far far too expensive. The prices are absurd and make you not want to come back. Vegan food is no longer a novelty in Miami, so you can get up to par food somewhere else. The prices will never make sense to me and I don't care that it's all organic, non-gmo, gluten free, etc. I've managed this food lifestyle for a long time, eating at lots of spots, and making my own delicious cuisine, and it's never been this pricey. I think prices should be reconsidered or portions."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/18/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Casual vegan restaurant that's great for lunch. The menu is pretty extensive with a lot of choices. I didn't want to read through the menu so the employee happily made some recommendations for me. I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the Mental Lentil salad bowl. The portion was generous and the dish is flavorful. I also had a small vegan brownie that I wasn't crazy about. I found it a little bland. In any case, I'll definitely return here to try some other menu items."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/14/2016,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I really wanted to give choices a 5-star rating but unfortunately I cannot. This place has potential and I understand that they're trying to build it as a chain restaurant so they have to keep the ingredients simple and consistent but not being able to add fresh garlic to our food?? We got there about 10 minutes before closing on Sunday evening and no nobody was there -just us. That was a little disappointing because when you go out to eat you want to have some atmosphere of other people enjoying food as well. We called about 30 minutes before we arrived to make sure it would be okay to arrive that late and they said no problem and the staff was very nice. We decided to sit outside since it was a lovely June evening in Coconut Grove and the food came pretty quickly within 10 minutes or so. The food was very bland, we told them we liked spicy when we ordered...so he brought sone cayene pepper but by that time we were almost done eating. But worst of all the food was served at room temperature! How could this happen? Didn't you make our food fresh? We decided to treat ourselves to some desserts which were good but very very sweet. That's one of the problems with vegan food they don't seem to hold back on the sugar. Well that's not very healthy- sorry. Also I asked for hot water and I wanted it to be very hot. So I guess they microwaved the mug with the hot water and the waiter served it that way. Next time try dumping the hot water that was microwaved into a different cup so that the person doesn't burn their lips. I also looked around at some of their items that you can purchase for home like bagged chips and such and they're not very picky about what they're selling there. Maltodextrin and other bad stuff in the ingredients. We will try the weston location next."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",2/23/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,We ate here twice on a recent Miami visit. Great vegan meals and super friendly staff that wanted to be sure we were completely satisfied. We especially recommend the tofu scramble wrap and the mac and cheese.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",2/28/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"The food here is absolutely spot on!  I asked the lady at the counter is the breakfast scramble is vegan.  She replied ""Everything here is vegan, including me.""  That was cute.  I've never had or even imagined pesto toast.  It's something that is so simple but ""Wow"" at the same time!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/21/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"First time eating vegan and I'm impressed!! I was taken here for a work event and didn't know what to expect. We got a spread of all the most popular items, so I got to try a bunch of new things. Started with the kale caesar salad which I definitely recommend. Nachos were on point too. I'll be headed back there next time I'm in Miami!!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",9/8/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Looking for a cruelty free place to dine? Choose Choices! As a vegan myself I am very glad this location opened up in coconut grove.  For all my meat eaters don't worry they do not just serve salad. As in its name you have many options to choose from.  I recommend Karma burger and Insane taco sliders if you want a ""meat"" texture and it taste great. Food is made to order so you should expect to wait a bit or use the online order feature (it can get busy during lunch hour).  Pricing is the only thing that will stop me from giving it 5 stars but  if you happen to shop at Whole Foods then it should not shock you. As for the venue it is a very spacious  And also has a small organic food item market.  You will also spot a small bakery where they make their bake goods.  Yum!  Make sure you pay for parking  (this goes to any dinning experience in coconut grove) the city does enforce parking citations and car booting.  Overall great spot for vegans or anyone with a curiosity for plant based lifestyle."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/16/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Absolutely love this place! Was in town for work so I jumped at the chance to find a vegan restaurant since there aren't many in Lakeland/Tampa. The service was awesome - our cashier was super nice and gave us delicious recommendations. Someone else came out during our meal (the manager perhaps?) to see how we were doing. We had the chipotle nachos with soy chorizo and the tacos... The tacos were really good but the nachos were INSANE. Even my meat-eating friend loved it. Highly recommend!
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/13/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I'm so happy this spot opened just a couple of blocks from my job.  It's nice to walk in to a restaurant and know that I can order anything off the menu as it's all vegan!  ,So far I've had the tacos, lentil burger, fries and for breakfast I had the pancake with sausage. Everything has been delicious !  The fries are baked so not as tasty as regular fries but healthier .  The lentil burger is just amazing.  And don't get me started on the tacos.... Soooo yum.  My goal is to eventually have had everything off of the 10 for $10 menu ."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/19/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Great place for some yummy organic vegan choices! Second time here and both times have really enjoyed it. The space is lovely and the outside patio deck was a great place for Sunday lunch. I love the nachos with chorizo (made of soy). The salad bowls are fresh and plenty. The service has been excellent. Nichole was awesome! They have local Kambucha. Wasn't crazy about the maple donuts, but all the other desserts were heavenly!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/15/2016,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"First off I Never want to take business away from a restaurant such as this one. Im a huge supporter of vegan/organic style restaurants. I had a wonderful experience at another location. ,This location was def slacking. Paid extra for basically everything that I wanted on my salad. Ended up paying $25 just for a salad.. Asked for salad with just a little bit of quinoa on top. Had the ground lentil some mushrooms, avocado, and the garlic dressing and tahini dressing. Not much right!? ,Was told they could do anything I wanted.. But the girl at the counter said no while the cook said yes.. Ended up not having the quinoa and got charge something like 3.95 for a tiny little side of quinoa.. With my drink/kombucha and with my boyfriends wrap and his drink it was a $45 lunch.. Disappointing is what it was!!  could've been a 1 star Yelp but really am still rooting for this location to figure out what went wrong today."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/9/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Good addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to the yoga studio as well however I am not sure where it is going. We had the tacos and the protein plate and both were pretty tasty. I will admit I had low expectations for vegan, organic etc. A couple downsides were 1) the person taking our order didn't seem very knowledgable. It is a very extensive menu and I asked her about the ""chickpea tuna"" and she said it was made from soy. It's actually made from chickpeas of course but I wanted to know what made it ""tuna"" and I couldn't get an answer. 2) they don't have high chairs and the entrance isn't very stroller friendly. There is a handicap lift but it seemed complicated and intimidating. There is a little area where you can sit on the floor which is cute but if you have a toddler that can't sit still it makes for a very active lunch."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/25/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"So happy Choices opened up in the Grove. Super convenient for us who live a little more south. They incorporated a beautiful Ganesha on the wall, that just that is worth the visit. I totally recommend the Mental Lentil Wrap. I always say I'm going to get something new but somehow that little piece of heaven always wins my heart. Now that it's so close I have no excuse but to explore other vegan delights. Thanks Choices!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/15/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,This is the place to go for vegan and organic foods. All of the choices are shockingly delicious without dairy or any other meat. The dine-in area is very comfortable and the people are extremely friendly and welcoming. Do try this place!
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/8/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I've been a choices café costumer since it first opened in Brickell, They have been able to change without compromising the quality and flavor of their menu. My favorite item is the vegan burgers, believe me you will not notice the difference between their burger and a real one!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/18/2017,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Didn't expect to find anything like this in Coconut Grove. Staying at the Mayfair due to a flight delay. Vegan google popped up this place. Walking distance. Lovely outdoor seating. Greeted nicely on entering the establishment. Open seating with a view of food prep. Everyone smiling.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",1/10/2018,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I'm not overly familiar with vegan food, but I had lunch here today and it was amazing! The nachos were delicious- definitely check it out!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/25/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Delicious clean food! It's vegan so don't expect any meat, but rather some delicious substitutes for protein!!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/11/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I am the one who stands outside the place waiting for it to open at 10:00 am so that I can get my fix.  This place is awesome.    Savory tasty plant based food... you wouldn't believe it!   The La Pixsa tastes (to me) like picadillo on a crispy gluten free cracker topped with shredded carrot.   Amazing!!!    My next favorite is the Mental Lentil wrap on a gluten-free wrap with the Habanero sauce on the side.  Yum!   All very filling.  This morning I was craving their breakfast, so I had the GF pancake with blueberry, tofu scramble and their plant-based bacon and sausage.  With real maple syrup to boot!   Oh, and don't forget their lattes.  I like the Green Matcha latte with coconut milk.  Even their baked seasoned fries with that yummy organic ketchup are delish!  All in all, this is my go-to vegan place because I like how much flavor their food has (and I am not vegan, LOL).  I hear that they are going to make the place even better!  The staff is top notch, very friendly.   Also, they have a lovely front porch where you can soak up some Vitamin D and enjoy the ocean breeze of Coconut Grove.   Love this place!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/24/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Of course I had to return a week after my first trip here to try more things on the menu. I had the Chicken's Friend. I ordered it with a side of mac and cheese. The wrap was great, I had been searching for this particular ""chicken"" dish ever since New Orleans and I'm pleased that this came close. I hoping to try a ""Chicken Friend Po boy style"" in Choices Cafe's near future. Now back to, todays meal. The wrap was very filing and tasty. The mac and cheese wasn't my favorite but I haven't tried very many vegan mac and cheeses and thought that I would take the suggestion. My husband also had the Chicken friend and was very happy and full afterwards. Dessert! Now this was a treat, I love everything coconut and my donut was so damn good! My husband inhaled his cookie....I couldn't tell you what it tasted like ;),I really enjoy this place, the staff, atmosphere and food are all on point, such a great location to take advantage of the surrounding sunday funday activities  Miami has to offer."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/15/2017,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I think that it works against the favor of this restaurant, but I lived in LA before where it was saturated with vegetarian/vegan restaurants.  This restaurant is wayyyy to expensive.  I got the Justice Burger which was absolutely delicious but when I spend $10 on a burger I expect it to come with fries or another side.  I ordered a ginger latte and burger.  The total came to $15!  Yikes!  I was still hungry.  How much would've I had to pay to fill my belly?"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",11/15/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"So proud to be supporting the vegan scene. This place is well put together, has the right ethos, it's delicious and nutritious. When your visiting the Coconut Grove area and you're a vegan/vegetarian/ food appreciator of any kind, this is worth the visit."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/15/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,I love that this spot has so many -Organic & -Vegan options!!! I highly recommend this place because they staff is  so nice and overly caring
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/29/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,A great choice for vegans. I loved the quinoa bowl I got. The prices are fairly cheap around $10 for most items. A must check out for vegans.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/23/2016,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Choices is not a stranger to my vegan foodventures, matter of fact it's probably one of the first places recommended to me that I absolutely loved...hands down. My love for it is so intense, that after a 13 mile run this past month my thoughts the last mile were strictly revolving around what I would order at Choices when I got there. It's been a tradition for the last three/four halfs we've ran to eat here afterwards- so this half would be no different. ,We decided to visit the newest location in Coconut Grove since we'd already been to all the rest. Upon walking up, I was surprised to see the space- a lot larger than the other Choices which is great. Tall ceilings and ample space. In addition to that, there was a yoga class taking place right out front- after a little research I noticed the class fee includes a nice breakfast right after which is a great little incentive to start your  morning right- with some breakfast and some movement. Since I'd done plenty of that after 13 miles I was ready to get down. I normally order the 3 gluten free vegan pancakes (your choice of 2 toppings) Today however I wanted something a little different and was a little intrigued with the Insane Pancake- it's a gluten free pancake filled with cashew cheese and soysage. I struggled with the idea but really wanted something different and went for it. Sooooo glad I did. It was the perfect combo of sweet and salty. It's not as filling as the tres cakes which is why I ordered a second one. My recommendation which I figured out my second visit here is ordering the Insane along with a side of the breakfast scramble or better yet- asking for the Kind Slam and see if they'll make it an Insane for you- the staff is great at accommodating requests. Everyone is very friendly and helpful with the menu and the food is beyond awesome. ,For those of you afraid of the word ""vegan"" get over it. It feels amazing to work out and re-fuel somewhere that serves healthy and organic plant based food without compromising taste."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/3/2016,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Wow this place was better than I expected! I recently have been looking into vegan and vegetarian dishes. Although I'm not vegan myself this place was awesome. The inside is super cute and welcoming. The guy working there was extremely helpful, knowing that I wasn't vegan he suggested a couple of dishes I should try. I ended up ordering a ""chicken"" salad. (I forgot the exact name ugh) the chicken of course wasn't actual chicken it was soy based chicken. I've tried several different soy based chicken and this one by far was the best tasting one! Along with the salad I ordered a cup of the soup of the day which I believe was called the Mongoo soup. It had several different greens, lentils and some brown rice. Very good! ,People often think that vegan food is tasteless and not very good but if u think that give it another try at choices! You won't be disappointed. The menu has several different things that will appeal to anyone! ,Now the only reason why I give it 4 stars and not 5 was because of the prices! I get it organic and vegan products are more money but it shouldn't be that way! For a salad and cup of soup I paid $24. A little pricey but it was honestly worth it."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/3/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Excellent vegan food!!!! Amazing cheesy sauce! Loved the chorizo also.  Highly recommend.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",9/15/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Top Vegan place in Florida. The name truly does it justice, the menu has such a wide variety that as you are reading it your mouth waters from just wanting it all !,My boyfriend is not Vegan but he sure does love Choices Cafe. The food is always fresh and made to perfection. ,Will recommend even if you are not Vegan, you have to try this place !"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/27/2017,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I was really looking forward to trying this place while on vacation. First, let me say I loved the environment. People were painting and it has a closed off section where you can sit on the floor on pillows to eat. I really loved that. They had an expansive menu, with tons of different options. I really appreciated that as well. It is EXPENSIVE. I had La Pixsla, ($16) which sounded amazing in theory but left much to be desired. It was super bland. I chose pesto instead of chipotle mayo. My mom had the soy chorizo be choosy wrap with rice and beans. She said it was bland and you couldn't even taste the soy chorizo. I ordered pancakes for my son with banana and chocolate chips (which is a staple in our house). They were good but too expensive at $12. I could've gotten the ingredient and had a months worth of pancakes for that price. Mac & cheddy (which is also a staple in our home) was SUPER bland. No taste. No salt. Nothing. NOTHING. The only thing that we ordered that wasn't bland were the fries which were overly seasoned. Like too much. I got two donuts. $5 each. Tasted like cardboard. House tap kombucha  was really good. And I was able to get water in a cup for free. THANK GOD. Listen, I'm a plant based vegan and I'm all for spending money on food that's healthy and environmentally friendly - but $70 for three people is a bit steep even for me. I know a bunch of restaurants like to not season their foods for fear of a bad review or comment but please don't be shy here. Vegan food is not bland usually but full of flavor. I really wanted to love this place but it was a miss for me."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/26/2018,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Great vegan options for people looking for a healthy, meat-free place to eat.

"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/13/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,I got the tres cakes pancakes and you get to choose 2 toppings for each pancake plus maple syrup. They're gluten free pancakes and also vegan! I loved this place!

"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/13/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"My mom and I visited Choices after getting off the Holistic Holiday at Sea vegan cruise, and it was perfect compliment to all the great food we had on board. I'm gluten free and vegan so to have so many options was fantastic! The gluten free wrap was excellent and I definitely couldn't tell it was gluten free, no falling apart or braking! Great service as well! My only disappointment is its in Miami, open one in Sarasota!?"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/10/2017,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Wow!  This vegan restaurant is SO GOOD!  I had the breakfast scramble on a wrap and it was so delicious I 1) took the menu with me to study it; and 2) I'm not a ""breakfast person"" yet I woke up at 6:30 to be ready to eat mid morning.  Intriguing donut case beckons you to taste ""Maple Bacon"" and ""Cinnamon Sugar"".  Try a sample of Lemon Ginger Kombucha Tea and enjoy"

The variety in the menu is incredible, they had my order done and the cashier lady was very nice. This cafe made me love vegan even more! I love the food, it all tastes natural and homemade. Just the right touch of seasoning. I'll definitely be returning again. If your vegan or even if you aren't come here because the food is as if you had made it at home. The location is nice and cozy and they even have books to read... just incredible! Super happy with this cafe! Keep it up! ,- Happy new customer! ,And thank you for opening up a well tasty and healthy cafe."

Creative vegan food with fun menu items like burritos, burgers, pizza,  tacos, pancakes (my favorite), and more. All vegan. All delicious. Their cheese and meat substitutes are amazing... Very friendly staff and we wish them much success. It's now becoming a vegan food hall with smoothies, pizza, ice cream, and more to come. Miss their location in North Miami but glad to see quality and service is still top notch. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend you do"

I work in the grove and have been looking for a healthy, reasonably price place near by. This is IT. I had a wrap with the lentil meat. AMAZING. I even tried their vegan cookie and omg, one of the best tasting cookies I have ever had. It was so chewy and delicious. The guy who greeted me was sooooo nice and helpful, the best. I will be coming back here. I am going to try the brownie next time."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/27/2018,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I really honestly did not like this place but I want to give them four stars because it is such a good idea. I have been vegan for almost 8 months now and I basically only eat at home. The only place I can comfortably eat at is GLAM in midtown. Choices cafe is such a brilliant idea and I wish them the best... But coming in as a first time guest, it is VERY confusing and overwhelming. I still don't understand the place hahaha. If you're paying card you have to order on a kiosks by yourself, which no one tells you or welcomes you... You just have to read the signs. The sign menu I read was different from the kiosk menu. I couldn't find what I was looking for and I started to get terrible anxiety so I just ordered the soup and I then had to ask an employee if they would bring the food to me or what I needed to do. She told me that they would bring it to me. I had chosen the ""for here"" option and they brought me a paper bowl with a plastic lid and a plastic spoon(or so they seemed - there were no ""biodegradable"" signs but maybe I'm wrong), I went to open the cup and the VERY HOT soup spilled all over my hands, the table was wobbling back and forth as all this was going on... and I was feeling miserable. I waited for the soup to cool and finally took a bite and the moment it touched my lips and mouth, that was when I remembered why I don't eat at vegan restaurants... Because vegans love to make food SPICY AF. I don't get it haha. But I hope to go back to try their breakfast menu soon!! I want to give them another shot! Maybe I will feel confident enough to order something more special! Ha!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/7/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I am OBSESSED with this place! Amazing creations and flavors that make veganism a joyful experience as you're introducing yourself into this lifestyle! Staff is beyond friendly and helpful, enthusiastic and always with great energy! D'Angelo in particular is my favorite...hee hee...although I am fond of the entire staff! Love Mexican? Do the Quesadilla (I add walnut meat), I kill for a 'be choosy' wrap (or bowl) and don't get me started on the tacos or burgers! Honestly, everything is good considering the menu is somewhat limited. If you haven't been here, go for it!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/19/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I love this place. Great variety of vegan dishes, amazing customer service, and the owners are spectacular people who really care about their food and their customer's experience. They are in the process of opening Miami's first vegan food hall, which is going to be amazing! Try one of their burger with the Impossible Burger patty! Everything here is organically sourced."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",1/21/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I come here whenever I'm on business in Miami- it's a quiet little place to get away. I usually get some kind of rice bowl, smoothie, and vegan desserts. I always grab a ton of sweet treats to go."

We live in Austin but come to Miami often to visit family. This will definitely be a ""must go"" place every time we're in town. ,We ordered the:,1) Gluten Free wrap with chickpea tuna, greens, carrots, pesto sauce, and chipotle mayo: It was amazing!! Being GF, I'm never able to get the wrap option and I was super impressed. Will definitely get this again.,2) Karma burger: My husband has been craving a burger for a while and this hit the spot!,3) Quesadilla: My little guys (5 and 3) shared this and really enjoyed it.,4) Mac n Cheddy: We also ordered this for the little ones. They usually love mac n cheese but weren't really fans of this one. (Probably the only thing we didn't love.) But still decent.,5) Loaded fries: Awesome! Fresh cut potatoes, very flavorful beans and amazing sauces! ,6) Maple Fakin' donut: A little too sweet for me but everyone else liked it a lot. Great texture.,7) Peanut butter brownie: GF and vegan! Delicious! It was so moist and chewy! Hit the spot on all of my pregnancy cravings! ,Thanks Choices for offering amazing vegan food!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",3/25/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"My girlfriend and I had lunch there today. We enjoyed the nachos very much, they were delicious. She had the insane wrap and I had the karma Burger. They were both delicious but the wrap was our favorite. We will be strong-arming our non vegan friends to join us in some healthy and delicious food at choices cafe, hopefully sooner than later. We met one of the owners Alex, he was extremely friendly, helpful, and inspiring. He advised that exciting new things will be coming soon to choices cafe. I am looking forward to it."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/1/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,This place is really so delicious and the people working there are so nice. They have some of the best vegan pizza in south Florida.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/8/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,INCREDIBLE!!!!  Everything was absolutely delicious. Even my teenage son ate the most delicious vegan pizza.
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/12/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"If you are new to vegan eating as I am, head over to Choices Cafe as soon as you can. There is no pretense here whatsoever. The staff are happy to answer menu questions, describe dishes, and are pleasant and warm in doing so. There are many dishes here I want to try but on this first visit could not resist the Southern Soul. Think of ribs, Mac and cheese, a ranch and onion dressed salad, with a surprising addition of Plantains to gild the lily. I cannot imagine anyone not liking this dish--and it's 100% plant based as is everything at Choices.,Although full after all that, I couldn't resist a sundae for dessert. I recommend the Salted Caramel Fantasy, but there is full ice cream parlor within Choices so you can get whatever you want from a scoop to a big sundae or shake. Choices also makes pizzas, juices, smoothies, smoothie bowls, and their own Kombucha. Next up--their Kind Slam this weekend at brunch. ,The layout is a bit confusing at first but don't be deterred. It will all make sense after the first time ordering."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/8/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I absolutely love Choices. I had my first meal at Choices as a non-vegan and have since then continued to come back for over a year and a half as a vegan :),I especially love the brunch menu and wish pancakes were all day! ,The smoothies are delicious and they have me hooked on the strawberry basil kombucha they sometimes have on tap. The other flavors are also great though!,I remember when the Coral Gables location was open and was sad when it closed. But I see it was so worth it in the end for what came out of that! I am so so so happy with the VShops food hall and all of the concepts that have come out. Next Generation Pizza is perfect. Lex BBQ and Helen of Napoli are definitely my faves! It's worth the drive to the Grove for sure!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/6/2018,$$,3,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I work across the street from Choices so this has become a very regular lunch spot for me. I am not a vegan but I do enjoy all kinds of food and I'm not one to knock vegan food AT ALL. I love the food here and the Be Choosy bowl is my go to, and pretty reasonably priced. I love that they have kombucha on tap, the baked goods, and the smoothies. Everything here is good, and don't get me started on the sauces. I can never have enough. ,I would have liked to give Choices 4 stars but I just can't. Actually, this rating is really more like a three and a half. Organizationally, Choices feels disastrous every time I come in here and this review will mostly cover my experience here overall instead of just the food. ,1) I feel like there's never anybody ready to take your order and they seem understaffed. I realize vegan food is kind of labor intensive to make, so I can understand all the multitasking involved with the staff here but I really don't think I should have to wait upwards of 8 minutes before someone attends to me at the register. I'm usually here on weekdays between 10a-1p so I don't know if that impacts this. ,2) They advertise online ordering but every time I submit an online order (so I don't have to waste 8 minutes of my lunch break waiting) it's ignored and I have to contact Yelp to have it cancelled. Why do you offer and advertise this if it's not something you actually use? ,3) I can see the effort here at Choices. Vegans are extremely passionate and I love it but I feel like Choices needs to make a lot of organizational improvements before it can really appeal to people so much to even pay $10 for parking just to visit (okay I might be exaggerating the parking costs, but you get the point). ,Again, I love the food. My only complaint food wise is probably that the portion of ""meat"" feels stingy on the Be Choosy bowl but it's all delicious and I'm not sure what the standard is for a typical vegan joint. I had a sample of pizza once and it was delicious. I would love to have more of it but $20 for a pizza is a little steep for a lunch break meal, so maybe I'll have one on a weekend if I'm around. I'll still continue to come here despite the nuances I mentioned and I hope the new Vegan Shops concept is beyond successful and can't wait to see what else they will start offering."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/7/2018,$$,4,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Being vegan in Miami, we have very limited places that offer a fully vegan (and organic) menu so my husband and I frequent Choices. We mostly come here on the weekends for their breakfast/brunch options (served from 9am to 3pm, Saturday's and Sunday's). Choices used to have more locations located throughout Miami which have recently closed, for financial reasons, I suppose. ,Anyway, I usually have the kind slam with a plain pancake (and [loophole] add the cashew cheese as a topping but ask for it on the side so it's not charged as an extra). My husband usually orders the same thing with an extra pancake (which is an extra $6 - the tres cakes is $12 - you do the math) and a coffee. ,In short, I'm giving them 4 stars because we find that the tab can quickly run on the higher end for two. But, if you want to have some good organic vegan fare then get your wallet ready."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/6/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"My girlfriend and I are truly addicted to Choices Cafe ,their menu is outrageously good with many great options if you're a vegan/gluten free eater. We frequent this restaurant 2-3 times a week for their amazing GF burritos and hand cut baked fries. Personally I like to dip the fries in their habanero sauce, it's simply a perfect combination. Btw the owner prepared a special burrito just for us that's not on the menu, it was called ""El Primo"" and it was ridiculously good,  truly on point, flavorful with a wicked good chipotle mayo. Also they have a fantastic GF lentil meat pizza which becomes an obsession, I would eat 2 in one sitting but my girlfriend won't let me. The atmosphere is great, the staff is really attentive, especially the owner Alex very cool guy, passionate, who is always there greeting customer and sharing Vegan stories. Oh yeah make sure to try the GF wild berry ice cream on a GF sugar cone it's that damnnn good. Choices really is one of the better vegan restaurants in Miami plus they're mostly organic which is a great touch. VIVA HABANERO SAUCE!!!!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/4/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Wow we really enjoyed ourselves! For the appetizer, we had guacamole with sour cream drizzled on raw chips. I had a the Southern Soul Food platter with vegan bbq ribs, mac & cheddy with plantains over greens. My boyfriend had a Karma double burger with tempeh bacon, guacamole, lettuce and tomato with ranch dressing. He also indulged in a side of mac & cheddy. For dessert we had raw cacao avocado pie with a nutty crust. Awesome menu and the staff was informative and friendly. Good vibes!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/2/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Choices and the VShops Hall have taken vegan to a whole new level! The quesadillas were beyond amazing! The guacamole is made with organic avocado and deliciously creamy. I also had a smoothie, chocolate silk, topped with crunchiness! The pizza, enchilada alor, was so delicious that I'll be dreaming about it for days! ,The fries are made to request! I mean wow! ,Everyone visiting Coconut Grove needs to make Choices and the VShops a stop! The Quesadillas are a must!!!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/28/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"I've been here twice now and always love everything I try! Today I tried the Karma burger and loved it, it's bursting with flavors. Hard to believe it's vegan! ,Looking forward to trying something new next time; there are so many options it's hard to decide what to get every time! I am not vegan but love vegan dishes, and these are top notch and full of flavor. I highly recommend the restaurant for vegans and non vegans alike!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",4/26/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"This place is heaven! I come here pretty regularly as they have so many delicious vegan and organic options for every hour of the day! The pancakes are great, they have the golden (turmeric) latte which I love and is so good for you, my go to is the karma burger and now they have the impossible burger patty which I'm obsessed with! They also have smoothies with ad-ons like ashwaganda and reishi mushrooms... yum...,the people who work there are so special and positive and love what they do! DiAngelo is heaven on earth- thank you for your positive energy, passion in explaining everything and your recommendations!,I just love coming here and if you appreciate healthy, clean, delicious food you'll love it too!"
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",8/2/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"Always a fan of Choices, but lately the game has been upped. I always here everyone who isn't a vegan saying they don't eat the food because they feel they need to eat again right after because it doesn't fill them up. No worries here. It's so delicious and so filling, you may skip your next meal! Or you can eat half and finish the rest later. I love the choices (pun intended) of wraps, bowls, salads, smoothies, pizza, ice cream...list goes on and on. A stand out in the Grove for true vegan pleasure. No worries about getting anything but straight up vegan fare. I love the new concept...and the vibe is great and lively the last few times I've been there (fyi, have only gone for lunch lately). BTW, the Monkey Business smoothie was delicious. Paper straws, not so great...LOL. Maybe offer some steel straws for sale? Thank you for hanging in there in that off the beaten path location. Much appreciated by the Miami community."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",6/24/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,"My boyfriend and I have been vegan for a while but we always cook at home. After visiting several (extremely disappointing) vegan places, we had high hopes for this place. They completely surpassed my expectations! The customer service was amazing, the atmosphere/vibe is awesome, and the food- oh, the food- it's so good! We had 2 Karma Impossible Burgers, and the Enchilada Alor- sweet Christ I could come here all the time if I could. The only vegan restaurant that serves good/junk food without feeling guilty. Can't give them more stars than 5 so I'll leave it at that."
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",7/12/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Great tasty choices for the beginner vegan or if you're wanting to try something different. I really like the mexican wrap (also you can get it as a bowl with quinoa or rice).
"2895 McFarlane Rd, Miami, FL 33133",5/5/2018,$$,5,Choices Cafe - Coconut Grove,Just absolutely delicious vegan food! Everyone is very friendly just an overall great experience.
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/17/2009,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"Green Gables Cafe recently moved large space down the street from my office.  Which gave me the perfect opportuntity to try their restaurant.  The place is awesome restaurant.  All items served here are made from fresh local grown organic food.  The salads and sandwiches are fresh and tasty.  They cater to variety of palettes.  They serve vegan, gluten-free, or vegaterian specialities too.  ,Must try this place if you work in the area."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",10/9/2015,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"I just had there turkey Vaca frita, it was delicious, and for dessert, I had there vegan key lime pie and coconut mini cupcakes, it was delicious and satisfied my sweet tooth, also, there service is great , for anyone who is into eating healthy I recommend this place"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/8/2013,$$,5,Green Gables Café,I really love this place. Tree hugging vegan healthy awesomeness. I have already had lunch here twice ordering from the daily specials menu and been very pleased with the fresh and tasty. Simply Amazing.
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/14/2013,$$,3,Green Gables Café,"I am a vegan so I was interested in trying out Green Gables Cafe. Surprisingly, they only had 2 or 3 vegan items, so I had the daily special of vegan soup and salad. The soup was good, the salad was bland, so I was left mostly disappointed with my experience. However, I would bet that most people in the restaurant weren't vegan but were eating, and enjoying, their other vegetarian and omni dishes. Though I did have their vegan chocolate macaroon and it was very good. To the restaurant, it would be nice if vegan options were a bit more considered, especially since you claim to be vegan. We do exist in Miami."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/11/2010,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"FINALLY!! I met Vanessa S. for lunch here today because she knew I had been dying to eat here and woahhh had I been missing out! I walked in at around 1ish and the place was packed, but it was not hard to get a table and we sat down right away. Considering I'm attempting the vegan thing again, this was the perfect choice! We were greeted by our server whom, to my surprise, was a good friend of mine from high school. Very pleasant meal.,The joint is tiny and cozy, with a very friendly feel. Their logo is painted on the left wall, and the rest are decorated by art they sell. Right now they have a beautiful collection of very tasteful women nudes, I was mesmerized by the drawings. ,The menu is absolutely refreshing, offering all kinds of organic and healthy options for breakfast, sandwiches, snacks and sides. We shared their hummus which you could tell was homemade because of the richness in flavor. Vanessa had the vegetarian black bean burger which looked exquisite and I had the Lunch Bowl entree which consists of a scoop of basmati brown rice inside the organic soup of the day (red lentil...hhhmmm), garnished with avocado slices. It was soooo good! and the perfect lunch option for a cold day. ,I see myself coming here again, and again and again, its so hard to find vegan and vegetarian friendly places that not only offer healthy food but that its also flavorful and delicious!"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",5/13/2014,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"My wife and I visited this place for breakfast on a Yelp search for vegan restaurants. Although the menu did not list vegan options, they were VERY vegan friendly. The chef adapted two delicious entrees to vegan. We had the oatmeal, and the tofu scramble. They were perfect! The service was also great. Our server ""spoke vegan"" and made several recommendations. ,Stop by and try it. You will not be disappointed."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",9/26/2013,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"I have not personally been inside the establishment, but i have been ordering the vegan daily special for lunch for the last 2 weeks (delivery) and i am extremely satisfied. Dont worry carnivores there is plenty for you too. The mere thought of giving up decadent cheeses, sour cream, and eggs has me reaching for Zoloft.,I never thought i would be one of those people that says i don't miss dairy when i order the vegan lunch here. If i could eat here 3 times a day, vegan would be a piece of cake. The hummus veggie wrap is delicious, i know what your thinking, how good can a hummus wrap be? it exceeded my expectations, the black bean burger is really good too. zucchini spaghetti w pesto and walnuts. Everything is yummy, filling and very tasty. Only reason why i am taking down .5 star is because the prices are a tad high. I know its all organic but 15-16$ plus 2$ tip EVERY DAY for lunch for some veggies in a wrap feels ridiculous after a while(YET, i keep coming back).(the meat daily specials are usually lower 13-15$) Some soups are better than others- but depends on your taste. I for one thought the oven roasted soup would be tastier than it was, i prefer the lentil. i have yet to try the others. ,the meat specials sound great too, vaca frita wrap- fish tacos etc.,DEF. recommend this place,quick delivery.,great phone service"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",6/18/2012,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"it's difficult to find the ethical-food trifecta: ethically sourced, tasty, and affordable.  Those three things are pretty much the gold standard when dining veg/vegan, and rarely are all three found (if ever) in one location.  Green Gables cafe manages to get 'ethically sourced' pretty good, and also get tasty (but not succulent, and not mouthwatering: but tasty), and not quite 'affordable,' but its also not outlandishly expensive.  So, for a veg outing, it is a wonderful place. ,butternut squash soup: creamy, tasty, nice portion, fresh,Cobb salad: multi layered, ethically sourced eggs and meat,Chicken curry salad: very tasty.  nice portion size.,Crab salad: homemade, fresh crab balls, lightly fried, flavorful, over large salad.  Miso dressing is wonderful: hearty and flavorful.,homemade fresh desserts (not sure about vegan options: most desserts seemed to include flour/eggs),Service is quick and very friendly, busy busy  during midweek lunch hour."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/3/2013,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"Went there early for the Vegan Burger and sweet potato fries. The vegan burger comes with avocado, some vegan aioli, on a great sprouted bun. The sweet potato fries were good, actually diced with some spices. The server asked if I wanted ""spicy sauce"" of course! The spicy sauce is like a spicy ketchup, though not sweet. While the burger was good, I'd have to agree with an earlier review about it being a little pricey for what you get. However the service was great."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",1/17/2014,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"Amazingly good food, but if you're a vegan, realize that this place is not necessarily catered to you. It's vegan-like foods, all organic but with most entrees also coming with free-range or harmone free meat as well. There are vegan options just not too many. Food is still amazing and noble. But I definitely wish they had more vegetarian and vegan options."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/11/2012,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"HOLY SHENANIGANS! The vegan burger! SOOO DELISH! the Black bean was good too! The homemade sweet potato 'fries' were good too but i would have liked them to be a bit crunchy! This place was really good. Would definitely go again!,PS: I agree with some of the other reviews, definitely needs to be bigger! They are so busy most of the time. More square footage a must!!!"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/26/2014,$$,3,Green Gables Café,"One of the only good solutions for vegans around town. The staff is very nice, and the food is quite good. The options are various, you can accommodate every lifestyle in here. Make it Vegetarian, Vegan, Fruitarian....,The place is not hyped up, the design is pretty basic and the overall aspect is quite 70's. However its packed, and the food is very fresh and tasty. I go there quite often as it is good, simple, and efficient. I tend to have the chance not to look into my budget too much when it comes to food, but I think this place seemed to be quite affordable, especially for the type of healthy food you will find there."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",12/10/2012,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"I have a confession to make.... this place makes me want to go vegan, or at least become a vegetarian for a whole year! Just because their food is amazing, fresh, and left me craving for more.,Anyhow, I came here last Friday because I wanted to take more initiative in securing myself a Yelp Carrot Top badge and because I have been slowly packing some extra pounds, so after a quick Yelp search, I am pointed to Green Gables Café.  ,I take the Coral Gables trolley from my work (probably one of the best ways to get there), and I arrive at the cafe.. In front of me is the quaint shop I usually passed on my way to OneBurger. The greeter is friendly, and my food is ready and warm in exactly the same time, they told me it would be ready. Huge plus for their exceptional service and timely service.,Things I noticed from the decor: it is very homey! Ample amount of seating. I want to eat here one day.,I head back to my office, open the bag, and my eyes are greeted by one of the best looking chicken curry salad pitas I have ever seen. It costs me $12.83 and is a good portion. The chicken is fresh; the curry is delicious and sweet; and the pita is strong so it doesn't leak any of the juices out. Just the way I like it. The side salad was pretty good. It was dressed in a refreshing vinaigrette. The only negative thing I have to say is that I wanted it to come with blue corn chips. (minus one star). I am not sure if that was my fault or the restaurant's, but I thought the chips were the default side, and when I ordered my meal on PayPal, it didn't give me an option. (plus one star because you can order on PayPal, minus one star because it didn't list an option).,Overall, I would come here again,.,Major plusses: delicious food, Paypal ordering, friendly servers, good prices,Even better ifs: It really isn't walking distance. I wish the website offered you to list options.,I just wish I had my blue chips now."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/27/2015,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"Love the healthy options, vegetarian/vegan varieties as well as non-v: the black bean burger is the best one i've had. I think the menu should change to give more options once in a while so i don't keep repeating, it is small."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/26/2012,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"Green Gables always has really great, fresh, organic, and vegan food.  I order from them for lunch on a regular basis and have never been disappointed.  The vegan special is always delicious as are their soups (which are always vegan).  The vegan special is usually something like an egglplant hummus wrap or black bean burger with half a soup, zucchini spaghetti, or chickpea stew.  The salads are also all really delicious and they have a different seasonal salad each day.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because, yes, it can be a little pricey, and I think only once did they make a small mistake with my order (forgot the drink). If you sign up for the e-mail list, you will get the daily specials every morning.  It can get very crowded for lunch, so I usually order for delivery or to pick up.  ,If you're looking for vegan food in Miami, this is the best!"
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",8/19/2016,$$,4,Green Gables Café,A friend suggested I try this place out and it was pretty good.. I would definitely be going back.. You will not leave disappointed if you visit and its reasonably priced considering its a vegan restaurant
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",3/8/2016,$$,5,Green Gables Café,I love this place ! Their menu is simple and delicious. It is quite small and they do get very busy but the servers are quick and attentive. If you are looking for great vegan/vegetarian food in the Gables then you must give them a try!!
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",11/19/2015,$$,5,Green Gables Café,This is a great place for lunch. One of my favorites and always excellent. I eat here at least once a week when I am here for work. Love the Tuesday house special. Great vegan options.
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",2/12/2016,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"This style of food is vegan, vegetarian, and organic. An excellent alternative to have lunch, even though prices aren't too reasonable, portions are of good quantity and their plate presentation is simple. This place is small and service is quick."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",9/19/2014,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"We wanted to try a healthy , organic place , we found this place ! We loved it , i went for late breakfast and my family lunch , we ordered  turkey vacafrita , the gluten and vegan cupcakes , hot chocolate and simple breakfast .,The honey wheat bread is delicious , love that  they have a lot of selection of gluten free, almond milk  and vegan food .,This is a 95 percent organic place , would recommend to anyone ."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",9/7/2016,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"Cute small place! I really enjoy trying new vegetarians/vegan/organic restaurants and I must say Green gables it's a great one. They have a good menu, fair prices and friendly staff."
"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",7/21/2016,$$,4,Green Gables Café,"I discovered this little place when I started working in the area. It's an excellent healthier option for lunch and has something for everyone. At first I though they only had vegetarian/ vegan foods, but their menu is full of delicious foods that would normally lack flavor in other healthy joints.,I've had their turkey picadillo and turkey vaca Frita which both come with brown basmati rice and mixed greens. They're super flavorful and the portions are pretty generous. I've also had heir hummus which is great with pita. Their brownies and wheat chocolate chips cookies are yummy too! ,The place gets slammed during the Gables lunch hour so your best bet is to go or pickup before 12pm or after 2pm. Aside from what I mentioned, I've heard their Other dishes are delicious. I just always stick with my usual craving!"

"327 Alhambra Cir, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/12/2018,$$,5,Green Gables Café,"I used to frequent Green Gables years ago... then had an unfortunate crab cake incident & hadn't been back in awhile. Thank goodness I let a co-worker talk me into giving it another chance! Even walking up to the café is an experience. Beautiful hanging plants, vintage bulbs & their iconic green door. As soon as we entered, the host (maybe owner?) welcomed us with a warm smile. We lucked out as we got there just before the lunch time crowds (11:50 or so) & were able to secure a table for 6. The service was great! Super attentive & everyone seemed happy to be there. I immediately zeroed in on the Super Food Salad Bowl (sautéed kale, Basmati brown rice, fresh spinach, tomato, sesame seeds, scallions, avocado, miso dressing) and added seared ahi tuna. As we waited, i hoped i hadn't made a mistake as i was STARVING and really wanted something filling. i was NOT disappointed. HUGE portion & every, single thing in that bowl was perfect! Textures, flavours, freshness. Just so delicious! Ny co-workers ordered the Deconstructed Turkey Burrito (black bean, basmati brown rice, turkey ""picadillo"", avocado, scallions, jalapeño aioli) and the Vaca Burrito Bowl (black beans, basmati brown rice, pulled turkey ""vaca frita"", avocado,scallions, jalapeño aioli) and they loved it also. Their Spicy Apple juice (fresh pressed apply juice with ginger) is phenomenal and their vegan chocolate cupcake was decadent! So happy to be back. LOVE Green Gables!"

"2121 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33134",4/30/2016,$$,3,POC American Fusion Buffet & Sushi,"I am pretty wary of buffets - add raw fish to that and I would get SUPER wary.  However, my vegan-self wasn't too worried on this occasion. ,We took a friend's advice and went during the busiest  time on the weekend - this way you know the food is being turned over and replaced often. Wise advice! ,We pretty much stuck to the sushi section and the salad bar. Upon request, they will make you a vegetable roll, which was nice. We managed to eat our fill, but nothing was incredibly overwhelming. ,It is a great bargain tough if you like buffets and random combinations, like waffles with your sushi for brunch :) The ambiance is quite hectic and family oriented on the weekends."
"8405 Mills Dr, Kendall, FL 33183",1/1/2016,$$,5,Pisco Y Nazca,"Loving the architecture and design of this place. Amazing environment, great service and even better food! Don't even get me started about the cocktails. The barlotto was delicious, and they even custom made my order to be vegan as I told my server about my special diet. So happy I visited, definitely going back soon!"
"8405 Mills Dr, Kendall, FL 33183",3/29/2018,$$,3,Pisco Y Nazca,"The best thing on the menu is the grilled octopus and rocoto ceviche. The cocktails and beer selection are nothing to write home about. Not a bad vibe but feels pretty lounge/generic. Could be better but could also be worse. Also, very little in the way of vegetarian/vegan options."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/31/2014,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"HIDDEN GEM! Just had lunch from this precious little spot and absolutely stuffed my face. You know how raw vegan usually leaves you wishing you were a tad fuller? Well my raw zucchini spaghetti hit the spot. It was like a deconstructed sun dried tomato hummus sans the tahini laid over a generous nest of dressed zucchini noodles. Very lemony and savory with the parsley and chickpeas. I'm satisfied!  the juice menu looks delicious too, you know I'll definitely be back for an açai bowl!!!,YES, total yes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/15/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,So glad I found this please thanks to a good friend who recommended it. I had the chicken wrap and it was delicious!! Love that there are gluten-free and vegan options for my husband. He had the black bean wrap with hummus and loved it. The owner and staff are very friendly. Hard to find a great place these days with great customer service. Can't wait to go back and try more things.
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",10/15/2016,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Cute little place that sells smoothies, salads, wraps & acai bowls.  Great for vegetarians & vegans.  My daughter order a monkey bowl & added stawberries to it.  They charge $0.75 for a to-go container.  I think the bowl was around $12.  It was a little pricey for the size but she enjoyed it.  A lot of the customers were regulars and knew to call ahead.  They still had to wait but no one complained.  Will come back to enjoy other items on the menu."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/21/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"FINALLLYYYYY a juice /acai / vegan options place in Pinecrest. Place is TINY; they def need to expand; and it's like 3 people working there so it gets crowded fast, but the menu is on-point, fresh, wholesome, and varied enough to satisfy plant/meat eaters alike. They'll customize anything. My only complaint is that they need to get a bigger space!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/25/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I was in the mood for something healthy in the midst of all this Black Friday craziness and what I found was an amazing tiny whole in the wall. This little treasure is heaven on earth for all you vegan/vegetarian/organic lovers. Now I see people complaining about the price, but you have to understand everything is organic, wild caught, non gmo, and REAL. The price should verify the authenticity for you, there's no way you're going to find a cheap all organic green place. It simply does not exist. But this place is worth the price, the wraps and juices are a good size and are all extremely filling. ,I had the soup of the day and a lentil wrap with hummus and it was soooo good! Filled with veggies and my tummy and body were so pleased. I also had the I Am Raw juice which is a green based juice that was also delicious. ,I can't wait to try their Acai bowls!! ,And the service was great. Very warm and welcoming and filled with good vibes."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",7/22/2017,$$,4,Raw South Juice,Love this place! The only issue I've encountered is the inconsistency of the food sometimes my vegan sandwich  is amazing and then the next day it isn't the same ... it's still good but not as good
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Raw has filled a void in Miami for high quality delicious plant based food! I love that they're veggies are organic so I can finally have a salad outside of my house and not have to worry about  nasty fumigation chemicals or GMO's. My favorite thing to get here is their daily special. Even if you are not vegetarian you will like it. They are bowl style and no matter what they are, they are delicious! My favorite is their vegan ""turkey"" picadillo and the black rice! The salad portion in the bowl is always tasty and unique.,The lady at the counter is such a sweetheart, immediately makes you feel welcomed and answers any questions you may have. She has the best energy and I love to see her when I come here.,Raw South is the perfect place to go when looking for healthy delicious food!"
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/30/2017,$$,4,Raw South Juice,"Best vegan and raw little spot ever! The owner is so nice and always there which is a great thing because she oversees it all which in my opinion is the best thing to me it means she cares customers are always satisfied.,Everything is FRESH! ,The blueberry acai bowl is sooooo amazing and she makes it look  beautiful I don't even want to eat it lol ,I've also tried the smoothie almonds forever and it AWESOME!!! ,Today I had the veggie soup, I must say it was very good! ,Everything is a must try! ,Updated 11/30 ,Still love the delicious food but a little disappointed with the amount of veggies I got in my salad that was $11. I got a decent scoop of tuna but not enough of the other veggies. I got a pinch of carrot (granted there is carrots in the tuna salad maybe another vegetable can be added) and maybe 6 tomatoes cut in half with 7 cucumbers. I still think it's Delicious but a little more veggies would be awesome. ,I paid $25 for a smoothie (mango pineapple with no banana) which was pretty good, tuna salad, and 2 chocolate chip cookies."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",1/17/2018,$$,3,Raw South Juice,"The staff members are hard-working, knowledgeable, and pleasant. It's helpful to have a vegan-friendly place in this area. However, I found the menu difficult to navigate because it does not clearly indicate which items contain animal parts/secretions. Benign-sounding ingredients in the monkey açaí bowl, for instance, are not vegan. Note that their peanut butter chips contain milk and their granola contains honey. When in doubt, ask! The açaí mixture was satisfying--and very cold, so I added coffee (which they don't have) from the bakery next door. That bakery also had some vegan desserts, like dates with cacao. A lovely match, which you can enjoy on one of the communal tables outside. This outdoor atmosphere is convenient, yet hectic. Be prepared to enjoy your organics amid exhaust fumes and honking from the intersection where the Palmetto Expressway, SW 77th Ave, and US1 converge."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",11/23/2016,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"Ugh! Juice bars and vegan restaurants are so misunderstood.,OK. Here is an explanation for prices. Everything is organic/non GMO. Some stuff is gluten free, and sugar is not used. Also, no animal products are used, unless you are getting a chicken/fish item. That includes ingredients like coconut/rice/hemp/soy/almond milk, vegan cheese, tofu, all that vegan/vegetarian stuff. And it also means raw/unfiltered honey, stevia root and other natural sweeteners. Don't take my word for it though. ASK!,But most important, it also means that the employees are getting paid a decent wage. ,I could keep going, but I will start going into more abstract subjects related to holistic healing and stuff like that. Anyway, the smoothies not only taste good, they make you happy. That is the power of organic foods, they deliver a different experience than normal produce.,Don't believe me? ,I guess you must try it then..."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",2/28/2017,$$,5,Raw South Juice,"I'm finally getting around to writing a review! This place is in my general neighborhood, so I come here often enough. Yes, it is a bit pricey; that is to be expected at an all natural, non-GMO, non-preservative, fresh produce and juices based restaurant. But the food is well worth it. It's a great place for health conscious people and vegans, vegetarians, and anyone in between looking for a place to eat lunch. My only complaint is that I wish they stayed open later. ,I like to bike here sometimes and munch on their veggie wraps, or slurp on their almonds are forever smoothie. They have a good selection of salads, as well. Their monkey bowl is pretty good too; it's a pretty big bowl so it's more fun to share with someone else. They also have the strawberry bowl, blueberry acai bowl (with almond butter is yummy), tropical acai, and other options. Their food is filling, and is definitely a favorite. ,They have bike parking, and car parking is in the lot. No wifi, but it's a great place to just sit and enjoy a book. It's usually pretty peaceful, so big groups aren't recommended. If you do want to be noisy, there is outdoor seating. ,Overall great experience, friendly staff, and aside from the above average prices and early closing hours, it's a great place to have lunch, brunch, an afternoon snack, early dinner after work-anything that fits your routine."
"9804 SW 77th Ave, Miami, FL 33156",4/16/2018,$$,5,Raw South Juice,Really delicious and fresh food as well as smoothies. Order took about 15 minutes. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for fresh vegan food. A little pricey but considering the freshness and and flavors it's well worth it

"5958 S Dixie Hwy, South Miami, FL 33143",5/28/2018,$$,5,American Harvest Co,"Had lunch here with the family. Food was delicious, staff friendly and prices reasonable, though portions were a bit on the smaller side. There are even a few vegan options available. I had the Curry roasted vegetable bowl, which was very good though it had one dissonant garnish (basil). Overall, a great experience and I am glad we have it as anew option in South Miami. Will definitely be coming back!"

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/27/2010,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I Yelped this place when I was visiting Miami last winter. It looks like a hold in the wall, but is definitely worth it, I promise. Once you make it through the health food store, you will find Carlos at the back counter serving up delicious and healthy vegan fare. He takes the time to chat with the customers, and even got to know me a little bit, which is something I truly appreciate. Nothing like a small business in times of evil corporations, am I right? Carlos is good people. He even let me get behind the counter for a Yelp photo :-) He gets his produce locally from what I could tell when I watched him buy some local fruit from a farmer before my eyes. I also watched him juice a freaking watermelon for me, which was amazing. I had the veggie burger and it was fantastic. Now I need to come back to Miami to visit Carlos and try more of his food."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/3/2009,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I love this place. It has been right around the corner from my house forever and I regret never knowing it. It is great for vegetarians or vegans. They have a ton of natural foods and ingredients for cooking as well as a little bar in the back with natural juices, smoothies, and an interesting variety of vegan/vegetarian meals and snacks. They also have some good dressings and sauces for whatever you order, and the owner/manager is happy to help you figure that out."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It was my first time at this adorable vegan place, and I'll definitely be back. I sat down at the counter, and was trying to read my magazine while waiting for my order, and it was clear that the friendly patrons and chefs weren't going to let me eat alone! The entire counter introduced themselves to me, as well as both chefs behind the bar. Everyone was incredibly friendly, and it felt like I had walked into a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other, but obviously welcomed any newcomer. Surprisingly, some of the patrons ate some meat occasionally. Which, somehow, in a weird way, is reassuring.....if occasional meat eaters love this place, so could I. The head chef gave me a sample of the squash soup, that was amazing, sweet, but not overpowering.  I then ordered the garbanzos and brown rice and 2 slices of baked tofu. It was phenomenal, and had so much flavor. The tofu was crispy and seasoned with something that was out of this world - absolutely delicious. The garbanzos were healthy and so fresh. I added this homemade mango hot sauce and I almost licked the plate. The patron to my right gave me the full low down on the place. Aside from their staple salads, sandwiches, and fruit/vegetable drinks, he explained that Chef Carlos has a daily hot vegetarian meal, that changes every day, but that it's the same meal on Mondays, every Tuesday, etc. But Fridays and Saturdays are the wild card. Chef Carlos makes whatever he wants on those days. I'd definitely go back, again and again. ,After my lunch, I did a little shopping, as I try to support small, local, business any time I can. The prices of the items were better than at Whole Foods, and the store staff was very helpful, making sure I found everything OK. I'd definitely support this establishment, and will encourage my friends to do so as well."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/12/2011,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"My brother and I found this place today for lunch.  On the outside it looks just like a health foods store but in the back is a counter with some stools.  They always have sandwiches and a few other things on their menu then there are the daily specials.  I had soy piccadillo, rice, and kale slaw and my brother had brocolli tofu pie all of which was delicious and vegan.  We shared a slice of his tangerine cake for lunch which was one of the best cakes I've ever had!"

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/3/2011,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love this place. I come here as often as I can, and usually grab a bite to eat and some empanadas to keep in the fridge. Carlos, the chef is fantastically kind and makes everything fresh every day. It's all vegan, which didn't bother me when I ate meat (it's realllllyyyyy good) and is much appreciated now.,Everything is fresh and home-made. It's all very good. Carlos will let you try anything before you decide what you want. Smoothies and juices are good too. (Spirulina smoothie especially!) I guess some people are put off by how old everything is but I always see everything washed thoroughly and the staff washing their hands all the time. I think people are confusing clutter and age with cleanliness, to be honest. I really don't know what else to say. Just go here. It's delicious, unpretentious and won't make you feel gross after eating."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/25/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Amazing little vegan restaurant in a little health foods grocery store.  Food is so tasty, you know it was made with much love and the price point is ridiculously affordable. My money goes twice to three times as far here compared to other vegan restaurants/restaurants with health conscious choices.  Wish they had a location closer to downtown.  Everything is bomb."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/24/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I absolutely love this place. Mom & Pop vibe. The food is great and the desserts are fantastic! Gotta try their vegan cupcakes! One must definitely try their smoothies. I've had a few of them and they are delicious!  Me fave is the Rainforest :) Also, the market portion of Beehive is fantastic if you're looking for natural products/supplements. This place has quickly become one of fave local markets and food spots! Check it out! :)"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/6/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Call for their specials, soooo worth it.  I had the asparagus soup and kale & brown race cake.  Tiny, non-pretentious, vegan. Love."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/29/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Chef Carlos concocts the most delish vegan dishes. The new and larger location is wonderful. You can eat healthy food and get expert advice on vitamins and supplements at the same time!

"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/26/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Alright, let me kick this off by saying I consider myself hipster to the bone. I mean, I start my day by putting on my horn-rimmed glasses, sparking up a hand-rolled cigarette, riding to work on my fixed-gear bicycle, and then writing reviews on Yelp that have a surprising amount of hyphens in them. None of those things are true except all of them, but the point still stands: hipster to the bone. When I walked into Beehive, however, I felt more mainstream than a migrating salmon. This place is seriously two weeks away from becoming a hippie compound, and I love it. The store itself is alright, stocked with seriously obscure items such as rose scented Dr. Bronner's soap, but just a bit-overpriced as expected. The juice bar/restaurant, however, is where it's at. They have a bunch of handmade vegan dishes, deserts, and, of course, juice, all of which are reasonably priced. You'll pay somewhere around $4 for a juice, $5 for a smoothie, and maybe something like $7 to $12 for a sandwich/main dish. On top of it all, the staff is friendly. As a native from New England, it felt a little bit like a trip to Vermont. While some in Miami who pedicure far too often or who drink creatine like their life depends on it probably won't be fans of Beehive, this place is a gem for those other people who catch obscure references or who grow out their armpit hair probably a bit too much. But, hey, I'm not judging anyone here, I mean, this entire review is basically an explicit judgement, but hey, you know, that's just how the vegan cookie crumbles."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/3/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I landed in Miami last month, and immediately went to Yelp to find a vegan restaurant.  I was on a Daniel Fast and was in need of a meal I would not have to assemble from the sides and veggie options available in a typical restaurant.  Yelp brought me to the Beehive and Carlos and Coco.  This place is a quaint, hole in the wall health food store with the most creative, delicious vegan food I've ever tasted.  Eating there made me believe I could be vegan for the rest of my life!  I'll definitely be going back there when ever I'm in town!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/8/2012,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,First time here. Very cozy homey feeling. Tried the orange-carrot juice. It was delicious! The guy in the kitchen was very friendly and offered me a free sample of the soup he had just made. Had the vegan sandwich. It doesn't look that big but it's actually quite filling.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/22/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I'm not vegan and this was my first vegan experience.  Soy Empanada, Chicharrones de Tofu, Green Juice, and a delicious highly charged soup that has my energy level on full throttle.   The specials come in after 12:30pm.  Please note they're  moving to Bird Road and SW. 65th Ave."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/3/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is amazing!  You could walk by and never even know its there.  The front is a tiny, two aisle grocery store, with vitamins and various vegan and health food items.,In the back there is a small counter where the friendly owner will greet you with samples of whatever he's making that day. When I first walked in he handed me samples of two different types of soup, pasta, and various other dishes.  I ordered the seitan and mushroom pie. AMAZING! It was so good and fresh.  It really had the best flavor and everything in it was cooked to perfection.  I also had the squash soup, which was sweet and creamy and wonderful.  To wash it all down I had a fresh juice- beet, carrot, celery and apple.  Yes, I know this sounds gross, but trust me its not. It is so good for you and the apple pretty much is the dominant flavor.  My sis had ""the rainforest"" which is a fresh juice/smoothie with avocado, banana, and I don't know what else, but it was very good.  ,There isn't a lot of room to sit, only a counter, and two small tables out front.  And the place was packed even though it was a thursday afternoon.  Honestly it is worth it.  I would stand and eat if I had to.  And even though the place was packed we didn't feel rushed by anyone, everyone seemed to be in a great mood.  ,Honestly it was the best eating experience I've had so far in Miami. I would HIGHLY recommend it to vegan and non-vegans alike.  OH did I forget to mention that it was completely vegan? Next time I want to try the apple pie..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/18/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Another Yelp find although I have been familiar with the Beehive for about 25 years, which makes me sound really old but my parents were friends with Bob (owner) and very healthy on top of it.  A lot has changed since then and when I heard about the counter in the back with all vegan homemade food I was game.  Chef Carlos is incredible - I feel like a regular and I have only been once, for take-out! The menu changes daily and you can sample everything before you buy.  I had a lentil soup, empanadas - although they were much more healthy and tasted different than any empanadas I have ever had! I also took a piece of broccoli casserole for lunch the next day.  Everything tasted wonderful (and healthy) and was affordable to boot! Next time I want to find what the delicious looking vegan cakes are since there was a tempting assortment on the counter..."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",10/21/2010,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"We've only tried the juices, so I'm giving the JUICES 5 stars.  Carlos uses unique fresh ingredients that you normally wouldn't think of mixing together to make delicious healthy juices.  We had one combining dragon fruit, mangoes, banana, and apple juice.  Another juice had avocado and ginger among many other fruits that was complex, delicious, and refreshing.  I look forward to going back and trying the food, even though I'm not vegan."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2008,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"DELICIOUS.  This is the best Vegan place I've been to in Miami.  The chefs are playful and fun.  They love talking to everyone in the place.  The restaurant has a bunch of loyal customers and for a good reason.  The food is fresh, delicious, and inspired.  I ate a dish called Tres Amigos that came with a sweet cilantro salsa on top with a small salad.  The presentation is simple and lovely.  I had the carrot, beet, celery juice that the other reviewer mentioned and it was DELICIOUS, sweet and nutritious.  ,I am going to make sure that I go back there again and again.  The place is absolutely a hole in the wall, but the service and food is so good that it doesn't matter.  From the outside it looks a little grungy, but that's because the lights aren't that bright and it has dark wood, so it looks a little dirty but everything on the inside is super clean."
"9251 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174",4/18/2018,$$,4,Pincho Factory,"This place is so amazing ! Free almost unlimited parking, and an outdoor seating area if you don't want to watch TV or hear the music. We were greeted right when we came in, the guy (I wish I got his name he is so attentive somebody give that boy a raise/promotion ! He was skinny and a little tall) I had never been here but have heard many great things and my boyfriend tried it last week and has gone back three times this week so I just had to try it. I'm vegan and he's not so I was a little skeptical if I was gonna find anything for me. I ordered their veggie burger minus the Cheese and pincho sauce. The veggie burger was amazing the only thing, it's not a burger. It's just mashed black beans with a couple other ingredients and it's just missing a little more seasoning. But I can't use this against them because they aren't a place who specifically caters vegans so im grateful to just have that option. Also the fricken sweet potato tater tots !! Oh my geez, why didn't I know what apple butter was before ? Who thought of this ? Whoever did I love you forever ! The flavors were so good and even though I'm vegan I can pin point good meat and my boyfriends steak pincho looked so JUICY. He also orders shrimp pinchos which looked perfectly cooked. Golden on the outsides and pink on the inside. I really love this place and the way the young man treated us ! This automatically became one of my go-to places in the area"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/4/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Yes, it has its quirks. BUT this place has fresh, delicious vegan fare, that has been home cooked with love. Carlos fills it with such positive energy you can't help but smile. It also has a lot of regulars, which gives it a hometown diner feel once you've been there a few times. You'll leave fully satisfied with no food hangover."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/12/2012,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Nestled in the back of a quaint, little health food store, Beehive may just be the best place for vegetarian/vegan food in Miami.  And unlike many of the city's health food restaurants, it won't cost you half a pay check to eat here.  I've read a few reviews by people whining about how ""cluttered"" the place is, or even went so far as to call it filthy.  Well if you're a spoiled brat who doesn't understand the concept of limited space, then maybe you'd feel that way, but it's as clean as any other restaurant that cares about providing an excellent experience, and that they do.  Beehive's small size makes for some very intimate ambiance.  Customers and staff are constantly chatting back and forth, and everyone seems to know one another by first name.,The food is excellent, and there's always a nice variety to choose from.  I usually start with two options, for example, a broccoli/tofu pie with kale slaw, usually enough to hit the spot.  It's also not a bad idea to just opt for one main item, plus a side salad.  The salad portions are generous, and include avocado, sprouts, and shredded beets, not just your typical run-of-the-mill salad ingredients.  Try it with their homemade miso dressing, very pleasant and mild.  The desserts are exceptional.  I've always found vegan friendly desserts to be very hit or miss, but they seem to have it down.  Their cakes especially are usually superb, especially the blueberry. ,Just give it a shot, they don't have a ton of loyal patrons for nothing.  You'll leave feeling great."

Carlos is a super nice guy, always smiling and making people laugh. The rainforest smoothie is my personal favorite. The tres amigos with brown rice and vegetables is fantastic. Soy picadillo and seitan empanadas are great. They have a pretty big variety of healthy deserts, love the cookies, carrot cupcakes and chocolate cake. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the place always looks messy and not so clean. I am big on cleanliness, but the food is too good to stop going."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"this place is like the Cheers of hippies and fake-aterians alike.  The chef is a quirky Brazilian dude named Carlos that entertains his die hard fans with his Seitan Pie, Soy Chicharron and vegan Saltena which i might add taste closer to to a real saltena than most spots and it doesn't even have meat! whoa.,It is hard to get a seat during lunch since the business executive lunch people and the newly retired older folks on a health kick are busy yapping away and gawking at what eachother ordered.  It's cute, theres a sense of community when people in all walks of life are guzzling down shots of wheatgrass and passing around that papaya hot sauce Carlos makes. ,The Rainforest smoothie is a must try. been coming here since 2005 and won't stop."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/4/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. As a new vegan it's so hard to find food on the go. Not only can you get your natural herbal supplements,  vegan proteins,  and a ton of healthy goodies, there is a freaking mini restaurant in here. I had baked tofu which taste just like chicarron (fried pork). The owner is hilarious and let's you sample almost everything as long as you give a smile in return. HOT FOOD IS ONLY SERVED AFTER 1PM. A little downer but still worth it. I assume they cook first thing in the morning so everything is fresh!! But before 1 they still have killer juices and sandwiches."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/7/2013,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This is hands down my favorite vegan/vegetarian/health food store/restaurants in the south Miami area. For the first time today I tried the Rainforest smoothie. That was amazing!!!! The ingredients sound very odd but it's simply delicious and very filling on its own: frozen bananas, avocado, apple juice, carrot juice, ginger, and lime (all natural and freshly squeezed). I also tried the spinach empanada from other yelper's reviews and it was simply outstanding!!! VERY good flavor. The squash soup was also very tasty and creamy with that perfect squash sweetness flavor. It's far from my work but it's my favorite lunchtime spot. PS- Gets full for lunch since there are only like 6 barstools at the counter. Best to take to go."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/1/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The Beehive has incredibly delicious and affordable homemade vegan food. The daily specials are fresh, healthy, and made with love. The smoothies are less than $5 and made with really good quality ingredients including fresh squeezed juices. Carlos is amazing! This place is truly one of a kind!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"If you are vegan it's right up your alley!! If you're not like me, then you'll be pleasantly surprised about how good the food is and you'll find yourself coming back again and again!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/10/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"yesterday was my first time here and I LOVED IT!! Health store with a juice bar is such a great idea. Everything looked very clean, fresh and welcoming. I had the mixed veggie juice and added cayenne pepper... juice was perfection!! i saw previous reviews about them using apple juice so I asked them about that and they said all the veggie juice use REAL apples. if it does have ""apple juice"" it does state it on the menu (usually only for the fruit smoothies) so they are not tricking you. the service in beehive was phenomenal and they will answer any questions you may have about there menu with no hesitation & everything in this location is truly organic and good for you. I also tried a pineapple cake that was gluten, dairy free & had low sugar so for a test, I took a piece home for me ( I have a milk allergy ) and for my diabetic mom to see if in the morning I would get a stomach ache and if her sugar would be high and guess what?!? I didn't get a stomach ache and my moms sugar was perfection. I also tried there vegan empanadas that were delish!! this place is perfect for anyone who watches what they eat and want top of the line vitamins. I have yet to check out the whole store because I was so into the food but I will be defiantly going back again and again and again !! they also have organic wine and beer that I will be buying next time I go to give that a try :) overall this place is a gem and I can't believe it took me this long to find it."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/22/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This place is awesome. I'm not even a vegan but I'm here twice a week at least for a good, fresh lunch that doesn't leave me ready to nap. Every dish and smoothie I've tried has been good, and the owner has great energy. It feels like a neighborhood hangout/cafe. Highly recommended!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",7/8/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Very Delicious place, they make it easy to be vegan with there great tasting meals. ,It is not the fanciest place in the world but they sure make up with it with great customer service and  healthy meals !"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/12/2014,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here the other day with my non vegan friend. When we sat down they handed us samples of the soup. And before we left they also gave us a sample of a smoothie! Everything was delicious. We had the special which was tres amigos, with veggie rice and kale slaw. It was delicious. He kept saying how good the food was. We also tried the vegan and gluten free cupcakes! We shared the carrot cake one and chcolate one. They were sooo good. Neither of us are big fans of carrot cake but that cupcake was amazing! Ill definatly be coming back next time im in the area."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/7/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The best restaurant in Miami. Most of the dishes on the menu are vegan. There is an option of tuna salad. Everything they make is excellent. The juices and smoothies are incredible. The staff is very accommodating. Carlos, the chef and owner is great with a very positive energy. The atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming. They have a great variety of dishes every day. They offer kombucha and the best Acai bowl in Town. I have tried all the vegan restaurants in Miami and out of Miami. By far the Beehive is the best. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you Carlos for such an amazing gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/10/2012,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,"I occasionally try to eat vegetarian/vegan - in no way am I a sworn meat-eater. I'll eat veggie if it's interesting and tastes good. Sadly, we don't seem to have many options that qualify on the ""interesting"" front. Having clocked the positive Yelp reviews for Beehive, a place my parents used to hit up for vitamins in the 1980s, I was mildly excited to finally make it over to the Red-Bird Schenley Park area for lunch.,Upon arrival, I was informed that they didn't have anything, except for veggie sandwiches, and cheese sandwiches. Groan. Veggies are fine in a sandwich, densely layered upon something thick and meaty. But veggies, as the main event? Sigh. Kill me now. ,The sandwich was some lettuce, tomato, carrot and sprout affair on whole wheat bread. It tasted as dull as it sounds. Some vinaigrette was provided in a bottle, and that helped the sandwich out somewhat.,OK, it filled me up. Fine. But I knew that was fool's gold, and I'd be hungry again in 30 minutes. I noted a cake of some sort sitting on the counter, in one of those containers you'd have expected to see on an old-timey 1950s Woolworth's lunch counter. I inquired. It was some kind of vegan strawberry-blueberry cake. It saved the meal. With what tasted like cream cheese icing, this cake was actually quite good. It wasn't over-sweetened, and tasted like real strawberries and blueberries.,I'd go back for the baked goods, but to earn more stars from me - I'm gonna need more than a carrot-and-sprout sandwich."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/13/2016,$,3,Beehive Juice Bar,Small parking lot. We tried the salteñas and the spinach empanadas. I highly recommend the vegan salteñas. We think the food could use more spice or offer a spicy salsa to go with the food.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/19/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"It's hard to find a mom and pop organic spot in Miami. This place not only has fresh organic products, but the staff is super friendly as well! My boyfriend and I had a tuna salad, tuna sandwich, vegan coconut cake (which is to die for) two wheatgrass shots, and a kombucha drink all for $30! Definitely our new healthy go to spot!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/15/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"I had the rainforest juice, eggplant, quinoa and veggies, and a carrot cake cupcake.  All fresh, all delicious, all vegan.  A+++"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",1/5/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Went here to help my grandmother find some herbal supplements for her arthritis and the owner was working the counter. He was super helpful and knowledgable and they had both herbs we were looking for (dragons claw and celery seed). Then of course, being a vegan, I walked around the aisles and found they had so many goodies. On top of that, the juice I had was delicious and I ended up buying 4 vegan empanadas to go. They were awesome needles to say, this spot is a hidden gem!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/19/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Every time I go to this juice bar, my experience is better than the last. The employees are always welcoming and will greet you with a smile. They are knowledgeable and will help you if you need any advice on what to get. There is also a store near the  juice bar containing natural foods and home remedies. If you need a suggestion to aid an ailment this is a pretty good spot if you rely on natural products. The food itself is phenomenal as far as vegan options go. They have a large selection and will cater to any requests. All around a great little spot."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",3/1/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"First time here and a non vegan and it's so good !,The atmosphere is nice and small. The owner is very welcoming and nice. ,I ordered the hummus sandwhich which was amazing ! And the raw cinnamon rolls as well. That was soooo good ! ,I highly recommend checking this place out!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",9/24/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,Love the vegan guava and cheese pastries and that you sell the spirutein protein powder packets. Nice vibe and I'll be back regularly!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/31/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"The very first thing that greats you when you walk into Beehive, is that it's actually a market for natural and Vegan products and that on the left side is the actual bar.,Awaiting is the owner - whose name I did not get - with a big smile on his face and an immense aura of friendliness that almost makes you suspect the quality of the food.,Then when you order any number of different salads or the daily main entree, or any of the smoothies and juices, you quickly realize you are somewhere that respects quality and that respects food.,In it's simplicity, the menu offers fresh vegetables and impeccably constructed pastries. ,Throughout your lunch, the owner is very attentive to your needs and he will continuously be friendly.,Highly Recommended."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/19/2016,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,For not being a vegan the  lunch specials are not only good but priced even better call ahead and place your order when you're on the way there's only a few guys behind the bar so it takes them a little while to get an order out especially if you're ordering a shot or a fresh juice which I highly recommend
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",4/24/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Beehive's new location still deserves five stars for delivering solid vegan and veggie eats in an area where they're not readily available. I remember being intimidated the first time I visited the small location but this spot is definitely more welcoming. ,The shop is now a lot bigger so there are a few tables away from the counter if you want to sit down and enjoy. The health market is also easier to peruse although I've never picked up anything myself. ,My go-to order is a Rainforest smoothie and a picadillo empanada with miso dipping sauce. It's deceivingly really filling so I rarely have room for a sweet treat, but when I do, it's always delicious. They have rotating daily specials and the owner Carlos will probably give you a sample of the soup of the day which is always tempting. Usually you'll find some sort of rice, beans, protein and veggies, making for the perfect plate at a decent price! ,The smoothie menu is now expanded and easier to read but I rarely venture from that Rainforest!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",8/27/2016,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,This is definitely my favorite juice bar in miami! The prices are not high and you get amazing quality juices and food. Everything taste fresh and delicious! I recommend everyone to check it out especially vegans! Super great vibes everytime!
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/23/2015,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"My all time favorite vegan spot and juice bar! I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian/vegan options are phenomenal. Always fresh and delicious, with new specials every day. Tons of fruits and veggies to pick from. Desserts are also vegan and delicious, as well as smoothies and juices. Owner is super friendly and service is amazing!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/27/2017,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Vegan and very tasty. Very casual spot, so service I thought could've been better. But all around a positive experience."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",11/19/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Carlos has been working hard at his art of ""vegan food"".,Growing up many ""hippies"" would always push this lifestyle. ,I do enjoy the foods from here and the funny jokes Carlos throws your way.,Would I eat here everyday? Possibly. If I can I always will make time to stop on by.,Thank you Carlos, you have blessed us for many years with your master in cooking."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",12/14/2017,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,Nice vegan food and juices. The owner is always overseen everything. I liked the empanadas and Rain forest smoothie. You must visit this wonderful hidden gem.
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",2/10/2018,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"Praise for Beehive!! Don't let the facade fool you. It looks like just a store, but you can also get yummy vegetarian/vegan options made fresh for you in their little restaurant. ,I was in the area and looking for something ultra healthy and natural and found this spot. We tried two fruit smoothies one with vegetable protein and one without. Highly recommend! In addition, we got the soy picadillo empanadas and mushroom empanadas. Holy wow! I was so impressed with the flavor that I'm going tomorrow to take some back to Ny with me. ,We also took the green salad to go and a Fred Vega table sandwich in Ezekiel bread. The perfect lunch. ,Would love to go back and try more items and shop around."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/1/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"This is probably in my top 5 places that I love going to and eating at! I absolutely love everything that's there is to offer in this little gem. This is a vegan spot but delicious and cooked to perfection. Everyday they have a different menu with a soup of the day, doesn't matter what's on the menu because everything is delicious including there delicious homemade deserts mind you this is all still vegan that will blow your taste buds away. Prices are also great nothing expensive all reasonable prices for great healthy food. The owner by the way is great guy and makes you feel comfortable with great service at the little mini restaurant bar. Cheers!!!"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/29/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Love love love this place, they sell so many natural/ cruelty free products & have amazing vegan food that tastes like it's made with love. The prices are fair and the products are great"
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",5/24/2017,$,4,Beehive Juice Bar,"I always find that they have the best selection of vegan dishes freshly prepared every day. I am not vegan but I do enjoy the creativity put into making meatless dishes that taste fantastic and are beneficial to your health. ,Their juice bar is on point, no frills, just a juicer and the freshest fruits and veggies in whatever combo you prefer. They also have a menu with suggestions and they are very helpful in giving you suggestions depending on your health needs. ,I like that they carry a nice selection of herbs, powders, and other natural health related items. You can find anything from deodorant to tea, to salt lamps. ,Everyone is friendly and seems to recognize me even though I don't frequent regularly. ,The food and juices are reasonably priced and definitely made with love and care."
"6490 Bird Rd, Miami, FL 33155",6/12/2018,$,5,Beehive Juice Bar,"Living down south I try to make it as often as I can, and every single time I go Carlos is as welcoming as always. The food is probably one of the best in the Miami area and the vegan brownies are to die for! Within my personal favorites are the lentil soup, tres amigos and even the empanadas are delicious. Recommend 100%."
"2613 NW 79th Ave, Miami, FL 33122",7/15/2017,$$,5,Doral Thai Restaurant,"This has to be my favorite Thai restaurant by far. The taste is very similar to actual Thai food straight from Thailand. I recommend also to those who are vegan, this place is the bomb! The Gang Phak is so good! It has mixed veggies, red curry with coconut milk and it comes with a side of rice."
"2613 NW 79th Ave, Miami, FL 33122",4/29/2017,$$,5,Doral Thai Restaurant,"No complaints! Very cute interior, super nice lady who attended me at pick up & delicious vegan/vegetarian friendly options. I recommend the veggie spring rolls, vegetable pad Thai (no egg) & the tofu red curry."
